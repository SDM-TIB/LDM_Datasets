To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Multilayer Graph Clustering with Optimized Node Embedding" by Mireille El Gheche and Pascal Frossard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may give context about the types of datasets used in multilayer graph clustering.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets. The authors mention three datasets:

1. **Synthetic dataset**: This dataset consists of three point clouds generated from a 2-dimensional Gaussian mixture model with five components. It is important to note that while this dataset is synthetic, it is still relevant for the experiments.

2. **NGs dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the 20 Newsgroup dataset, consisting of 500 documents pre-processed based on text segments. Each layer corresponds to different newsgroups.

3. **BBC sport dataset**: This dataset consists of 544 documents collected from the BBC Sport website, organized into five sport categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The synthetic dataset may not have a formal citation since it is generated for the study. However, I will ensure to provide citations for the other datasets:

- For the **NGs dataset**, the citation is:
  > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2009). A matrix factorization approach for integrating multiple data views. In ECML/PKDD (Vol. 5781, pp. 423–438). Springer.

- For the **BBC sport dataset**, the citation is:
  > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2009). A matrix factorization approach for integrating multiple data views. In ECML/PKDD (Vol. 5781, pp. 423–438). Springer. (Note: The citation is the same as for the NGs dataset, as it is referenced in the same context.)

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the NGs and BBC sport datasets, while noting that the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
