To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Neural Speaker Diarization with Self-Attention" by Yusuke Fujita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors provide statistics about the training and test sets. Here, they mention two training sets and five test sets, which are crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Simulated Mixtures**: This dataset consists of 100,000 mixtures generated for training, with specific parameters for overlap ratios. The authors describe how these mixtures were created using various single-speaker segments.

2. **Real Datasets**: This includes two real datasets:
   - **CALLHOME Dataset**: Used for evaluation, consisting of 148 recordings with a specific overlap ratio.
   - **CSJ (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese)**: Another dataset used for evaluation, containing 54 two-speaker dialogue recordings.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed statistics about these datasets, including the number of mixtures, average duration, and overlap ratios, which will be useful for my descriptions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **CALLHOME Dataset**, the citation is:
  > NIST. “2000 speaker recognition evaluation plan,” https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/09/26/spk-2000-plan-v1.0.htm.pdf, 2000.

- For the **CSJ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Maekawa, “Corpus of spontaneous Japanese: Its design and evaluation,” in ISCA & IEEE Workshop on Spontaneous Speech Processing and Recognition, 2003.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
