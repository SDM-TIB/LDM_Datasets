To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phase retrieval with complexity guidance" by Mansi Butola, Sunaina, and Kedar Khare, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention datasets used in prior work or relevant benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or data collection. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used in the study. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will examine it closely for any datasets that were utilized for testing or validation of the proposed methods. This section often provides insights into the datasets' relevance to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Fourier intensity data" or "binary phase object," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail. If the datasets are novel and created by the authors, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
