To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language models are weak learners" by Hariharan Manikandan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that utilized specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **related works section** for any references to datasets that are commonly used in the field, as these may not be explicitly mentioned in the experiments but are relevant to the research context.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is important in academic writing.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, I will look for the specific datasets mentioned in the paper and provide their citations. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
