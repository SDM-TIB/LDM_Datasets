To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Learning Improves Static Object Geo-Localization in Video" by Mohamed Chaabane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using a publicly available dataset focused on traffic lights, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they constructed and used. Here, they mention the **Traffic Lights Geo-localization (TLG) dataset**, which is derived from the **nuScenes** dataset. The authors describe how they selected scenes containing traffic lights and the process of transforming locations into camera coordinates. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also mention three sub-datasets created for their tasks:
1. **Traffic Lights 5D Pose**: Contains around 66,000 snippets of traffic lights with their 5D poses.
2. **Traffic Lights Matching**: Contains 200,000 pairs of images with bounding boxes and ground truth matching matrices.
3. **Multi-Traffic Lights Tracking (MTLT)**: Provides detection and annotation files for each video.

I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For **nuScenes dataset**:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027, 2019.

- For the **Traffic Lights Geo-localization (TLG) dataset**, since it is derived from nuScenes and does not have a separate citation, I will reference it as part of the nuScenes dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be clearly described, and I will ensure that the information is accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
