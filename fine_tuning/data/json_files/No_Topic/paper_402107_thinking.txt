To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Window-based Model Averaging Improves Generalization in Heterogeneous Federated Learning" by Debora Caldarola et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on standard FL benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the tasks they are used for.

From the text, I note that the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset for image classification with 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: A dataset for image classification with 100 classes.
3. **FEMNIST**: A dataset for image classification based on handwritten characters.
4. **GLDV2 (Google Landmarks Dataset V2)**: A large-scale dataset for image classification and retrieval.
5. **SHAKESPEARE**: A dataset for next character prediction based on Shakespearean texts.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their configurations or variations.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **FEMNIST**:
  > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečný, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. Workshop on Data Privacy and Confidentiality, 2019.

- For **GLDV2**:
  > Weyand, T., Araujo, A., Cao, B., & Sim, J. *Google landmarks dataset v2 - a large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2575–2584, 2020.

- For **SHAKESPEARE**:
  > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečný, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. Workshop on Data Privacy and Confidentiality, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
