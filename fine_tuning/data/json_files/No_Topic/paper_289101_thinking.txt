To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MSMatch: Semi-Supervised Multispectral Scene Classification with Few Labels" by Pablo Gómez and Gabriele Meoni, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **EuroSAT** and **UC Merced Land Use** benchmark datasets, which suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the datasets in more detail. They mention that EuroSAT consists of images collected by the Sentinel-2A satellite and that it includes both RGB and multispectral formats. The introduction also highlights the UCM dataset as a well-established land scene classification dataset.

I will then look at the **datasets section** (Section IV) where the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **EuroSAT Dataset**: This dataset contains 27,000 images in both RGB and multispectral formats, categorized into ten classes. The images are 64 × 64 pixels, and the multispectral data includes bands ranging from 443 nm to 2190 nm.

2. **UCM Dataset**: The UCM dataset consists of 2,100 images classified into 21 classes, with each class represented by 100 images. The images are processed into slices of 256 × 256 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **EuroSAT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Helber, B. Bischke, A. Dengel, and D. Borth. "Introducing EuroSAT: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification." In IGARSS 2018-2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, pp. 204–207, 2018.

- For the **UCM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Yang and S. Newsam. "Bag-of-visual-words and spatial extensions for land-use classification." In Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems, pp. 270–279, 2010.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for any further processing or review.
