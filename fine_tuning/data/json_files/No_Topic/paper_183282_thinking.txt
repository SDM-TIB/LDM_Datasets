To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic for recognizing alphabet characters and mathematical symbols" by Giuseppe AirÃ² Farulla et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software and mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for pattern recognition, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention the use of ANNs for recognizing characters in different alphabets but do not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **numerical results section**, I will look for any datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. Here, the authors mention using the **MNIST training set**, which is composed of 60,000 handwritten digits, and they also provide a comparison of their method's performance on this dataset.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The references include a citation for the MNIST database, which is crucial for providing the full citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned in the numerical results section. It consists of 60,000 handwritten digits used for training and 10,000 for validation.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the MNIST dataset from the references section:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. Available online at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare it for structured output, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.
