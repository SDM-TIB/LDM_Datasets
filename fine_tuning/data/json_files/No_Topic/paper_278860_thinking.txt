To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Derivative-Free-Optimization Algorithms for Targeted Black-Box Attacks in Deep Neural Networks" by Giuseppe Ughi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments or comparisons. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Comparison of Derivative Free Methods)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Dataset and Neural Network Specifications)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains images from 10 classes, with each image having dimensions of 32x32x3. The authors specify that they generated a total of 900 attacks per maximum perturbation energy per adversarial method using this dataset.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains millions of images divided among 1000 classes, with each image having dimensions of 299x299x3. The authors conducted 200 and 160 tests for networks trained both with and without adversarial training.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
