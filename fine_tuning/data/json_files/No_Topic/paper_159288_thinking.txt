To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Channel Estimation for Visible Light Communications Using Neural Networks" by Anil Yesilkaya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that measurements conducted in a controlled experimental setup are used to train neural networks for channel tap prediction, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the part where the authors describe the experimental setup and the materials used. They mention that the channel model heavily depends on the surface types of the environment, and they selected materials from NASA’s spectral database. This indicates that there is a dataset related to the reflectance values of different materials.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a detailed description of the input features used in the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which includes attributes like reflectivity, transmitter type, and noise levels. This table suggests that the authors have compiled a dataset based on various experimental conditions.

Additionally, in the **results section**, the authors discuss the measurements performed for different distances and materials, indicating that they have collected data across multiple trials. They mention a total of 360 measurements used to estimate channel taps, which is another dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to NASA’s spectral database for the materials used in their experiments, which is an important dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
> "Aster spectral library - version 2.0, [online].” http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov, accessed: 01-02-2016.

I will also note that while the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the measurements taken, it is important to acknowledge the experimental data collected during the study as a dataset.

In summary, I will compile the following datasets with their respective citations:

1. **Reflectance Values Dataset**: This dataset includes the reflectance values of materials used in the experiments, sourced from NASA’s spectral database.
   - Citation: "Aster spectral library - version 2.0, [online].” http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov, accessed: 01-02-2016.

2. **Experimental Measurements Dataset**: This dataset consists of the measurements taken during the experiments, which include various conditions such as distance, material type, and light source.
   - Citation: Not formally provided in the paper, but acknowledged as part of the experimental results.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
