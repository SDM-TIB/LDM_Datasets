To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Better Optimism By Bayes: Adaptive Planning with Rich Models" by Arthur Guez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "real dataset (the UCI 'mushroom' task)," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on **section 2.1 (The mushroom exploration task)**, where the authors describe the Mushroom Dataset from the UCI repository. Here, they provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of instances, attributes, and the context in which the dataset is used for their experiments.

The authors state that the Mushroom Dataset contains **8124 instances of gilled mushrooms from 23 different species**, described by **22 discrete attributes** (e.g., color, odor, ring type) and whether each mushroom is poisonous or edible. This section provides a clear understanding of how the dataset is utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Mushroom Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **Mushroom Dataset**: 
  > Bache, K., and Lichman, M. (2013). UCI machine learning repository, mushroom dataset. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom.

With this information, I have successfully identified and documented the dataset used in the paper along with its full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
