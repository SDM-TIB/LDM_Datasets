To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Macroeconomic Dynamics in a Finite World: The Thermodynamic Potential Approach" by Ã‰ric Herbert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a summary of the key findings and may mention datasets used in the research. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section usually details the data sources, types of data collected, and how the data was analyzed. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **results section**, I will check for any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the use of datasets. This section often presents the findings derived from the datasets, and the authors may reference the datasets again when discussing their results.

I will also review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the authors mention datasets such as economic indicators, environmental data, or any other relevant datasets, I will ensure to document the following for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains or its purpose.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication source, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "World Bank Economic Indicators," I would note it down as follows:
- **Name**: World Bank Economic Indicators
- **Description**: A comprehensive dataset containing various economic indicators from countries around the world.
- **Full citation**: World Bank. *World Development Indicators*. World Bank Group, 2023.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and future use. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited, facilitating further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
