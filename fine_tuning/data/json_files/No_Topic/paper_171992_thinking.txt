To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Should We Evaluate Supervised Hashing?" by Alexandre Sablayrolles et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on supervised hashing and mentions the use of datasets for evaluation, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images divided into 10 classes, with each image being 32x32 pixels in size. The authors use this dataset to evaluate their proposed methods in both supervised hashing (SH) and semi-supervised hashing (SSH) settings.

2. **ImageNet**: Specifically, the authors refer to the ILSVRC 2012 version of ImageNet, which contains over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories. This dataset is used for training and indexing purposes, with 50,000 validation images used as queries.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Rep., University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li Li-Jia, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
