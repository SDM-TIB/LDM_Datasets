To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effect of Data Types on the Performance of Machine Learning Algorithms for Financial Prediction" by Hulusi Mehmet Tanrikulu and Hakan Pabuccu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of forecasting cryptocurrencies and mentions the use of historical price data, technical indicators, Google Trends, and tweet data, which suggests that these could be potential datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **data preparation section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three types of information used for the analysis:

1. **Historical Prices**: This dataset includes daily values of Bitcoin (open, close, high, low, and volume) obtained from Yahoo Finance using the Python Yahoo Finance API.

2. **Technical Indicators**: The authors list several technical indicators calculated using the TA-Lib library, including Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and others. This indicates that the dataset is derived from the historical price data.

3. **Google Trends and Tweet Data**: The authors mention that they obtained daily tweets about Bitcoin and Google search trend data from bitinfocharts.com using the BeautifulSoup library.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of various machine learning models using these datasets, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources (Yahoo Finance for historical prices and bitinfocharts.com for Google Trends and tweet data), I will note these sources as follows:

- For **Historical Prices**:
  > Yahoo Finance. *Bitcoin Historical Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history?p=BTC-USD. Accessed: [insert access date].

- For **Technical Indicators**:
  > TA-Lib. *Technical Analysis Library*. Available at: https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/. Accessed: [insert access date].

- For **Google Trends and Tweet Data**:
  > Bitinfocharts. *Bitcoin Data*. Available at: https://bitinfocharts.com/. Accessed: [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
