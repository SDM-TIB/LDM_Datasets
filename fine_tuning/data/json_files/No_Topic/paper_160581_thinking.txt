To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Syntactic Patterns Improve Information Extraction for Medical Search" by Roma Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on improving information extraction in medical literature, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the PICO framework and the need for structured data in medical literature, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look further.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention:

1. A **corpus of 4,741 medical article abstracts** with manual crowd-sourced annotations for Participants (P), Interventions (I), and Outcomes (O) sequences. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and model training.

2. A **set of 191 abstracts** annotated for P, I, and O by medical professionals, which serves as the testing dataset. This is also significant for evaluating the model's performance.

The authors also mention that they retrieved structured abstracts from **PubMed**, which indicates that they utilized a large collection of medical literature for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from the authors' own collection and annotations. Instead, I will note the source of the structured abstracts:

- For the **PubMed abstracts**, the citation is:
  > National Library of Medicine. *PubMed*. Available at: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download/pubmed_medline.html

Since the other datasets (the corpus of 4,741 abstracts and the set of 191 abstracts) are created by the authors and do not have external citations, I will document them as internal datasets without formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations where applicable. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research.
