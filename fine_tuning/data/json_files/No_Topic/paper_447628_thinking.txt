To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal estimators of cross-partial derivatives and surrogates of functions" by Matieyendou Lamboni, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of surrogates for cross-partial derivatives and mentions simulations, which may imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used to validate the findings or to compare against other methods. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that could indicate the datasets involved.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will look for any citations that pertain to datasets. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations needed for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

As I identify datasets, I will ensure to note down the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The specific name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Ishigami function" or "Sobol's g-function," I will document them accordingly. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is comprehensive and useful for future reference.
