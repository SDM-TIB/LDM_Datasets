To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating features from lymph node stations for metastatic lymph node detection" by Chaoyi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on a dataset containing **114 intravenous contrast-enhanced CT images of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients**. This suggests that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **114 intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scans** of OSCC patients, which were used for training and testing their model. The authors also specify that the dataset was split into **80 for training and 34 for testing**.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is described as a collection of CT scans from patients, it may not have a formal citation like a published dataset would. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper regarding the dataset's characteristics and the context in which it was collected.

The relevant dataset information I will extract is as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: OSCC CT Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 114 intravenous contrast-enhanced CT images of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients, used for metastatic lymph node detection.
   - **Details**: The dataset includes CT scans with a slice thickness of 0.625 mm, and the patients' metastatic lymph nodes have been pathologically confirmed. The dataset was split into 80 training and 34 testing samples.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset in the references, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection and is described in detail in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the information gathered, ensuring that it is clear and concise for future reference or processing.
