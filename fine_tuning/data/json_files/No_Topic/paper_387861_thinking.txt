To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning with Noisy Labels by Adaptive Gradient-Based Outlier Removal" by Anastasiia Sedova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of datasets for training reliable models and suggests that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets. This indicates that datasets will likely be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors explicitly list seven datasets used for evaluation:

1. **YouTube Dataset**: A spam detection dataset with noisy labels.
2. **SMS Dataset**: Another spam detection dataset, also with noisy labels.
3. **TREC Dataset**: A dataset for question classification, which also contains noisy labels.
4. **Yorùbá Dataset**: A weakly supervised topic classification dataset in an African language.
5. **Hausa Dataset**: Another weakly supervised topic classification dataset in an African language.
6. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: An image dataset where noisy labels were generated by randomly flipping the clean labels.
7. **CheXpert Dataset**: A multi-label medical imaging dataset with noisy training annotations.

In the same section, the authors provide some statistics about each dataset, such as the number of classes, training samples, and noise percentages. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
