To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CheXpert++: Approximating the CheXpert labeler for Speed, Differentiability, and Probabilistic Output" by Matthew B.A. McDermott et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the CheXpert labeler and its limitations, suggesting that datasets related to chest X-ray reports are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the CheXpert labeler and its application to various chest X-ray datasets. They reference the original CheXpert dataset and the MIMIC-CXR dataset, which indicates that these are key datasets used in their work.

In the **methodology section**, particularly where they describe the CheXpert++ model, the authors detail how they trained their model using the MIMIC-CXR dataset. They specify that they used an 80/10 train/test split of this dataset, which provides concrete information about the dataset's structure and usage.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CheXpert Dataset**: The citation for the CheXpert dataset is:
   > Irvin, Jeremy, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, Jayne Seekins, David A. Mong, Safwan S. Halabi, Jesse K. Sandberg, Ricky Jones, David B. Larson, Curtis P. Langlotz, Bhavik N. Patel, Matthew P. Lungren, and Andrew Y. Ng. *CheXpert: A Large Chest Radiograph Dataset with Uncertainty Labels and Expert Comparison*. arXiv:1901.07031, 2019. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031.

2. **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**: The citation for the MIMIC-CXR dataset is:
   > Johnson, Alistair E. W., Tom J. Pollard, Seth J. Berkowitz, Nathaniel R. Greenbaum, Matthew P. Lungren, Chih-ying Deng, Roger G. Mark, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-CXR: A large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs*. arXiv:1901.07042, 2019. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07042.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **CheXpert Dataset**: A large dataset of chest radiographs with uncertainty labels and expert comparisons, used as a benchmark for evaluating the CheXpert labeler.

2. **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**: A publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs, utilized for training the CheXpert++ model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
