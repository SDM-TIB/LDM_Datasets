To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximate Model-Based Shielding for Safe Reinforcement Learning" by Alexander W. Goodall and Francesco Belardinelli, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate superior performance on a set of Atari games with state-dependent safety labels, indicating that datasets related to these games are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors state that they evaluate their approach on five Atari games provided by the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE). This suggests that the datasets used for the experiments are the Atari games themselves.

In the **experiments section**, the authors list the specific Atari environments they used along with their corresponding safety formulas. The games mentioned are:

1. **Assault**
2. **DoubleDunk**
3. **Enduro**
4. **KungFuMaster**
5. **Seaquest**

I will now check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The Atari games are part of the Arcade Learning Environment, which is cited in the paper. The citation for the Arcade Learning Environment is:

- For the Arcade Learning Environment:
  > M. G. Bellemare, Y. Naddaf, J. Veness, and M. Bowling. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253â€“279, (2013).

Since the datasets are derived from the Arcade Learning Environment, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Arcade Learning Environment as the source of the Atari games used in the experiments.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
