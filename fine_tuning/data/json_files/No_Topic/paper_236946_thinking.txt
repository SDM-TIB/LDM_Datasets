To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indirect Adversarial Attacks via Poisoning Neighbors for Graph Convolutional Networks" by Tsubasa Takahashi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section (Section VI)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **CORA-ML**: This dataset is described as having 2,708 nodes, 13,264 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes. It is commonly used for evaluating node classification tasks in graph neural networks.

2. **CiteSeer**: This dataset is mentioned with 3,312 nodes, 12,384 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes. Like CORA-ML, it is also a standard dataset for graph-based learning tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CORA-ML**, the citation is:
  > McCallum, A. K., Nigam, K., Rennie, J., & Seymore, K. (2000). Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning. *Information Retrieval*, 3(2), 127–163.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93–93.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
