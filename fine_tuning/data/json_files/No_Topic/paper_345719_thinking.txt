To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking the Defense Against Free-rider Attack From the Perspective of Model Weight Evolving Frequency" by Jinyin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that "Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets and five models demonstrate that WEF-Defense achieves better defense effectiveness." This indicates that multiple datasets are utilized, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: The paper states that the MNIST dataset contains 70,000 real-world handwritten images with digits ranging from 0 to 9.
2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **GTSRB**: The GTSRB dataset includes 51,839 real-world German colored traffic signs in 43 categories.
4. **ADULT**: The ADULT dataset has a total of 48,843 records, which were manually balanced for the experiments.
5. **BANK**: This dataset relates to a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution, containing data on 45,211 customers with 16 attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:

- For **ADULT**, the citation is:

- For **BANK**, the citation is:
  > Moro, S., Laureano, R., & Cortez, P. (2011). Using data mining for bank direct marketing: An application of the CRISP-DM methodology.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
