To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forecasting day ahead electricity spot prices: The impact of the EXAA to other European electricity markets" by Florian Ziel, Rick Steinert, and Sven Husmann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the relationship between the day-ahead electricity price of the Energy Exchange Austria (EXAA) and other European electricity prices, which suggests that relevant datasets may be discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (The considered electricity markets)**, where the authors describe the various electricity exchanges and their corresponding datasets. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the analysis.

In this section, the authors list the following exchanges and their corresponding datasets:

1. **EXAA (Energy Exchange Austria)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for Germany and Austria.
2. **EPEX (European Power Exchange)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France.
3. **APX (Amsterdam Power Exchange)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for the Netherlands.
4. **Nordpool**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for Denmark and Sweden.
5. **POLPX (Polish Power Exchange)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for Poland.
6. **OTE (Czech Republic)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for the Czech Republic.
7. **HUPX (Hungarian Power Exchange)**: This dataset includes day-ahead prices for Hungary.

The authors also provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes the submission times and data sources for each exchange, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' context.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow readers to locate the original sources of the data.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **EXAA**: 
  > EXAA. (n.d.). *Energy Exchange Austria*. Retrieved from https://www.exaa.at

- **EPEX**: 
  > EPEX. (n.d.). *European Power Exchange*. Retrieved from https://www.epexspot.com

- **APX**: 
  > APX. (n.d.). *Amsterdam Power Exchange*. Retrieved from https://www.apxgroup.com

- **Nordpool**:

- **HUPX**: 
  > HUPX. (n.d.). *Hungarian Power Exchange*. Retrieved from https://www.hupx.hu

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
