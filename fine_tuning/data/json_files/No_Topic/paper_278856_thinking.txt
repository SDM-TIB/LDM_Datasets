To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Routability Predictor Development Using Neural Architecture Search" by Chen-Chia Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "large dataset," which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset construction section** (Section V.A) where the authors describe how they constructed their dataset. They mention that the dataset comprises **7,000 placement solutions generated from 74 designs** sourced from various benchmarks, including ISCAS’89, ITC’99, IWLS’05, and ISPD’15. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition.

The authors specify the following sources for their dataset:
1. **ISCAS’89**: 29 designs
2. **ITC’99**: 13 designs
3. **IWLS’05**: 19 designs from Faraday and OpenCores
4. **ISPD’15**: 13 designs

I will now look for the full citations for these benchmarks in the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct and complete information for each dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- For **ISCAS’89**:
  > F. Brglez, D. Bryan, and K. Kozminski. "Combinational profiles of sequential benchmark circuits." In IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), 1989, pp. 1929–1934.

- For **ITC’99**:
  > F. Corno, M. S. Reorda, and G. Squillero. "Rt-level itc’99 benchmarks and first atpg results." Design & Test of Computers, 2000.

- For **IWLS’05**:
  > C. Albrecht. "Iwls 2005 benchmarks." In International Workshop for Logic Synthesis (IWLS), 2005.

- For **ISPD’15**:
  > I. S. Bustany, D. Chinnery, J. R. Shinnerl, and V. Yutsis. "Ispd 2015 benchmarks with fence regions and routing blockages for detailed-routing-driven placement." In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on International Symposium on Physical Design, 2015, pp. 157–164.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Comprehensive dataset for routability prediction
   - **Description**: Comprises 7,000 placement solutions generated from 74 designs across multiple benchmarks.
   - **Citations**:
     - ISCAS’89: F. Brglez, D. Bryan, and K. Kozminski. "Combinational profiles of sequential benchmark circuits." In IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), 1989, pp. 1929–1934.
     - ITC’99: F. Corno, M. S. Reorda, and G. Squillero. "Rt-level itc’99 benchmarks and first atpg results." Design & Test of Computers, 2000.
     - IWLS’05: C. Albrecht. "Iwls 2005 benchmarks." In International Workshop for Logic Synthesis (IWLS), 2005.
     - ISPD’15: I. S. Bustany, D. Chinnery, J. R. Shinnerl, and V. Yutsis. "Ispd 2015 benchmarks with fence regions and routing blockages for detailed-routing-driven placement." In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on International Symposium on Physical Design, 2015, pp. 157–164.

With this information compiled, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
