To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Wrapped Least Squares: A Tool for High Accuracy GNSS Attitude Determination" by Xing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the performance of the proposed method is evaluated using data collected from multiple GNSS receivers, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe two datasets collected during experiments on different dates. They mention that the first dataset was collected on **April 6, 2021**, and the second on **May 25, 2021**. The details provided include the number of epochs collected and the conditions under which the data was gathered.

In the **implementation section**, the authors describe the experimental setup, including the use of ANAVS multi-sensor modules, which further confirms the practical datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: Collected on April 6, 2021, with approximately 9000 epochs of data. This dataset was gathered under conditions with potential signal blockage and multipath errors.

2. **Dataset 2**: Collected on May 25, 2021, with around 25,500 epochs of observations. This dataset was collected in an environment with good satellite visibility.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since these datasets are experimental data collected by the authors, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they were collected.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details, ensuring to include the context of their collection and the dates. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or documentation.
