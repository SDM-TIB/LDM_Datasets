To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characteristics of Interference in Licensed and Unlicensed Bands for Intelligent Spectrum Management" by Zhuoran Su and Kaveh Pahlavan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses collecting real-time spectrum data in indoor and outdoor environments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Measurement Scenarios and Data Analysis)**, where the authors describe their data collection methods. They mention using a spectrum analyzer to collect interference measurements in both outdoor and indoor environments. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets.

In this section, the authors describe two distinct measurement scenarios:
1. **Outdoor Measurements**: Conducted in an urban area in Worcester, MA, using a spectrum analyzer mounted in a car. They collected approximately 700 to 1000 measurements during each test drive, with each measurement consisting of 401 amplitude readings across a frequency span of 600 MHz.
2. **Indoor Measurements**: Conducted in a laboratory setting, where the spectrum analyzer was moved around without GPS due to poor signal indoors.

The authors also provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 1**, which lists four datasets with their respective parameters:
- **8:00 Outdoor**: Location: -26.8908, Scale: 65.8010
- **12:00 Outdoor**: Location: -3.5453, Scale: 9.0201
- **16:00 Outdoor**: Location: -16.3339, Scale: 40.9457
- **AK 320 Indoor**: Location: 21.4714, Scale: 182.7133

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the datasets described in this paper appear to be original measurements collected by the authors, so they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that these datasets are part of the authors' own research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details such as the dataset name, location, and scale parameters. I will also make a note that these datasets are original to the study and do not have external citations.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
