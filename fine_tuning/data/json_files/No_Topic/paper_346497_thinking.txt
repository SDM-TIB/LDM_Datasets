To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Margin Representation Learning for Texture Classification" by Jonathan de Matos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on **texture and histopathological image datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussion)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using a **synthetic dataset based on Gaussian distributions**, the **Salzburg Texture Image Database**, and three histopathological image datasets: **BreaKHis**, **BACH**, and **CRC**. This section provides a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

3. **BACH Dataset**:

4. **CRC Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
