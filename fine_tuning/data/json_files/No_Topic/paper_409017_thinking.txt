To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NormNet: Scale Normalization for 6D Pose Estimation in Stacked Scenarios" by En-Te Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on public benchmarks and a newly constructed dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to three datasets: 

1. **Siléane Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing stacked scenes that are single-category and close to actual situations. The authors mention specific objects used for evaluation, which indicates that this dataset is relevant for their experiments.

2. **Parametric Dataset**: This dataset is synthetic and consists of single-category stacked scenes. The authors note that it has two test sets (L-dataset and G-dataset) for evaluating learning and generalization abilities.

3. **MultiScale Dataset**: This dataset is constructed by the authors and consists of seven objects with significant scale variations. It is used to evaluate the performance of NormNet in scenarios with multiple object categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

- For the **Siléane Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Brégier, F. Devernay, L. Leyrit, and J. L. Crowley. “Symmetry aware evaluation of 3d object detection and pose estimation in scenes of many parts in bulk.” In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2017, pp. 2209–2218.

- For the **Parametric Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Zeng, W. J. Lv, Z. K. Dong, and Y. J. Liu. “ParametricNet: 6DoF pose estimation network for parametric shapes in stacked scenarios.” In 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 772–778.

- For the **MultiScale Dataset**, the citation is:
  > En-Te Lin, Wei-Jie Lv, Ding-Tao Huang, and Long Zeng. “NormNet: Scale Normalization for 6D Pose Estimation in Stacked Scenarios.” In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
