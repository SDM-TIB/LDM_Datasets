To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis of COVID-19 Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning: A Review" by M. Rubaiyat Hossain Mondal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often highlights the significance of datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **results and discussion sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the studies reviewed. I will look for tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often contain key information.

In this paper, the authors mention various datasets related to COVID-19 diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning techniques. I will specifically look for sections that compare datasets, as they often provide insights into the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Image Data Collection**: This dataset is referenced for its use in various studies involving X-ray images for COVID-19 diagnosis. The citation is:
   > Cohen JP, Morrison P, Dao L, et al. *COVID-19 image data collection: Prospective predictions are the future*. arXiv preprint 2020.

2. **Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)**: This dataset is used for training models to differentiate between COVID-19 and other types of pneumonia. The citation is:
   > Mooney P. *Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)*. Kaggle Repository 2018. Available from: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

3. **COVID-CT Dataset**: This dataset contains CT scans specifically for COVID-19 cases. The citation is:
   > Zhao J, Zhang Y, He X, Xie P. *COVID-CT-Dataset: A CT scan dataset about COVID-19*. arXiv preprint 2020.

4. **COVIDx Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned for its application in deep learning models for COVID-19 detection. The citation is:
   > Wang LL, Lo K, Chandrasekhar Y, et al. *CORD-19: The Covid-19 open research dataset*. ArXiv 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
