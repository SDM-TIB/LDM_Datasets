To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeurWIN: Neural Whittle Index Network For Restless Bandits Via Deep RL" by Khaled Nakhleh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors evaluate NeurWIN on three restless bandit problems: **deadline scheduling**, **recovering bandits**, and **wireless scheduling**. I will check if these problems are associated with specific datasets or if they are based on simulated environments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors do not reference any publicly available datasets but instead describe the environments and conditions under which they tested their algorithm. The experiments are based on simulated scenarios rather than real-world datasets.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that the experiments rely on simulated environments rather than traditional datasets. However, I will still check the **References section** to see if any foundational papers or datasets are cited that could be relevant to the experiments.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several foundational works related to the restless bandit problems, but none of them provide datasets in the traditional sense. Instead, they describe algorithms and methodologies that could be used to create similar experimental setups.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets** were mentioned in the paper; the experiments were conducted in simulated environments.
2. The authors evaluated NeurWIN on three restless bandit problems: deadline scheduling, recovering bandits, and wireless scheduling, using simulated scenarios.
3. Relevant foundational works were cited, but they do not provide datasets.

Since there are no datasets to document with full citations, I will prepare a summary of the experimental setups and the contexts in which NeurWIN was evaluated, ensuring to highlight the absence of traditional datasets in the research.
