To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Feature Selection in Markov State Models Using Genetic Algorithm" by Qihua Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and mentions that the method is illustrated on four proteins, which suggests that datasets related to these proteins may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation Dataset." Here, the authors specify that the MD simulation datasets for four proteins (BBA, Villin, WW domain, and λ-repressor) were generated by Lindorff-Larsen et al. This is a clear indication that I need to extract this dataset information.

In this section, the authors provide details about the proteins, including their PDB IDs and the total simulation time. The relevant datasets are:

1. **BBA**: 
   - PDB ID: 1FME
   - Residues: 28
   - Total simulation time: 325 µs

2. **Villin**: 
   - PDB ID: 2F4K
   - Residues: 35
   - Total simulation time: 429 µs

3. **WW domain**: 
   - PDB ID: 2F21
   - Residues: 35
   - Total simulation time: 1137 µs

4. **λ-repressor**: 
   - PDB ID: 1LMB
   - Residues: 80
   - Total simulation time: 643 µs

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset source. The authors reference the work of Lindorff-Larsen et al. as follows:

- For the MD simulation datasets:
  > Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O Dror, and David E Shaw. *How fast-folding proteins fold*. Science, 334(6055):517–520, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **BBA**: PDB ID 1FME, 28 residues, 325 µs simulation time.
2. **Villin**: PDB ID 2F4K, 35 residues, 429 µs simulation time.
3. **WW domain**: PDB ID 2F21, 35 residues, 1137 µs simulation time.
4. **λ-repressor**: PDB ID 1LMB, 80 residues, 643 µs simulation time.

The full citation for the source of these datasets is:
> Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O Dror, and David E Shaw. *How fast-folding proteins fold*. Science, 334(6055):517–520, 2011.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entries for further processing.
