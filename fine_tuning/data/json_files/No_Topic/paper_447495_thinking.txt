To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Essay Scoring in Arabic: A Dataset and Analysis of a BERT-based System" by Rayed Ghazawi and Edwin Simpson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study introduces the **AR-AES dataset**, which is a benchmark dataset for Arabic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) comprising 2046 undergraduate essays. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in Arabic AES and the need for publicly available datasets. They mention that the AR-AES dataset includes essays from various courses, which reinforces the significance of this dataset.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 4 (The AR-AES Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its composition, the number of essays, and the evaluation criteria. They specify that the dataset consists of 2046 essays collected from undergraduate students across different disciplines, with additional information such as gender and scoring rubrics.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or links to access the dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset: https://osf.io/dp2nh/?view_only=4ac6373c60214ea6952855f81507fec7, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **AR-AES dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ghazawi, R., & Simpson, E. (2024). *Automated Essay Scoring in Arabic: A Dataset and Analysis of a BERT-based System*. Retrieved from https://osf.io/dp2nh/?view_only=4ac6373c60214ea6952855f81507fec7

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the citation is correctly formatted for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry with the necessary details and citation, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
