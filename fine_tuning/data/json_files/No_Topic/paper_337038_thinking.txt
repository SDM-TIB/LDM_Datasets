To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing Feedforward Neural Networks Training Programs" by Houssem Ben Braiek and Foutse Khomh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments conducted. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets used for training or testing their models, I will note down the names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
