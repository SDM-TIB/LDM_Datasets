To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the variance of internode distance under the multispecies coalescent" by SÃ©bastien Roch, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses species tree estimation and mentions "multilocus datasets," which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Definitions and results)** and **section 3 (Discussion)** for any specific datasets or examples that the authors might have used to illustrate their points. I will look for any references to datasets that are used in their analysis or examples that might be relevant to the study.

In the **References section**, I will check for any datasets that are cited. The authors may refer to existing datasets used in their analysis or provide citations for datasets that are foundational to their work. 

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note their names and descriptions. For example, if the paper refers to a specific dataset used for species tree estimation, I will document its characteristics, such as the number of species, the type of data it contains, and any relevant details about its structure.

I will also look for full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, making it easier for others to understand the context and significance of the data used in the research.
