To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comprehensive Instructional Video Analysis: The COIN Dataset and Performance Evaluation" by Yansong Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a large-scale dataset called "COIN" for instructional video analysis, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the paper. I will note down the details provided about the COIN dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The COIN Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, I will find specific information about the dataset, including its size, structure, and the types of tasks it covers. The authors mention that the COIN dataset contains **11,827 videos of 180 tasks** across **12 domains**. This section will also provide insights into how the dataset was annotated and the characteristics that make it unique.

In addition to the COIN dataset, I will check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors discuss various existing datasets for instructional video analysis, such as the **Breakfast dataset** and the **YouCook dataset**. I will extract the names and relevant details of these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the COIN dataset, the citation is:
> Tang, Y., Lu, J., & Zhou, J. (2023). Comprehensive Instructional Video Analysis: The COIN Dataset and Performance Evaluation. *CVPR*.

For the Breakfast dataset, the citation is:
> Kuehne, H., Arslan, A. B., & Serre, T. (2014). The Breakfast dataset: Action recognition in cooking videos. *CVPR*.

For the YouCook dataset, the citation is:
> Das, P., Xu, C., Doell, R. F., & Corso, J. J. (2013). A thousand frames in just a few words: Lingual description of videos through latent topics and sparse object stitching. *CVPR*.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extraction is comprehensive and useful for future reference.
