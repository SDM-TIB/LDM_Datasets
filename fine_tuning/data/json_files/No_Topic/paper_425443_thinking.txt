To extract datasets from the research paper titled "6DoF SELD: Sound Event Localization and Detection Using Microphones and Motion Tracking Sensors on Self-Motioning Human" by Masahiro Yasuda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and proposed dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors designed the **6DoF SELD Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or other datasets that might be referenced. The introduction discusses the need for a dataset that accommodates self-motion, reinforcing the importance of the **6DoF SELD Dataset**.

In the **proposed dataset section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **6DoF SELD Dataset**. They explain that it is designed for detecting and localizing sound events from the perspective of a self-moving human, using a headphone-type device with embedded microphones and motion tracking sensors. This section confirms that the **6DoF SELD Dataset** is the primary dataset of interest.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the dataset is used in any experiments, which it is, further validating its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **6DoF SELD Dataset**. The dataset is available at a specific URL, which I will include in the citation.

The full citation for the **6DoF SELD Dataset** is:
> Yasuda, M., Saito, S., Nakayama, A., & Harada, N. (2023). *6DoF SELD: Sound Event Localization and Detection Using Microphones and Motion Tracking Sensors on Self-Motioning Human*. Available at: https://github.com/nttrd-mdlab/6dof-seld (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.10473531).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured output that clearly presents the dataset details and citation.
