To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuPNet: Multi-modal Predictive Coding Network for Place Recognition" by Oliver Struckmeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the robot platform and the environments used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that the robot platform, WhiskEye, was used to gather visuo-tactile data sets for training and testing MuPNet. This indicates that there are specific datasets generated from the experiments.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results and evaluation sections**. The authors describe three environments (E1, E2, and E3) used for testing the place recognition performance of MuPNet. They also mention that the dataset consisted of 5550 images and whisker deflection vectors sampled in concert with visual images. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **Dataset from Environment E1**: This dataset was used to train the predictive coding network and consists of 5550 images and corresponding whisker deflection vectors.

2. **Dataset from Environment E2**: This dataset includes additional tactile landmarks and is used to evaluate the generalization capability of MuPNet.

3. **Dataset from Environment E3**: This dataset contains many tactile landmarks forming a continuous structure around a central rock, used for further evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference prior works that may have datasets relevant to their research, such as ViTa-SLAM and other tactile sensing studies.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset, including the original papers or sources where these datasets can be found.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset, ready for structured output or further processing.
