To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Complexity of the Inverse Semivalue Problem for Weighted Voting Games" by Ilias Diakonikolas and Chrystalla Pavlou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will carefully examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or any empirical results. These sections are likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the data was collected from" to pinpoint relevant information.

If the paper includes a **methodology or experiments section**, I will focus on that as it typically details the datasets used for analysis. I will note down any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, as these will serve as the authoritative sources.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or commonly used name.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, number of samples, and any relevant features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and presenting the datasets from the paper.
