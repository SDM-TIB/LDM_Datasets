To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring More When It Needs in Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Youtian Guo and Qi Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed exploration mechanism (AN2N) to continuous control tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section III (Exploring More When It Needs)** and **section IV (Result)**. In these sections, the authors describe their experiments and the environments used for testing their methods. I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets or environments.

In the **Results section**, the authors mention evaluating their algorithm on five continuous control tasks, specifically using the **MuJoCo physics engine**. This indicates that the datasets or environments used for testing are related to MuJoCo simulations. I will note that while the paper does not provide specific dataset names, the environments are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that describe the environments used. The authors reference the MuJoCo physics engine, which is a well-known simulation platform in the reinforcement learning community. The citation for MuJoCo is:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Todorov, Emanuel, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. "Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control." In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026-5033. IEEE, 2012.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the references that may be relevant to the experiments conducted in the paper. However, the primary focus appears to be on the MuJoCo environments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for the datasets or environments referenced in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
