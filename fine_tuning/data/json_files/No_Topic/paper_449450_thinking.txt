To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilising Explainable Techniques for Quality Prediction in a Complex Textiles Manufacturing Use Case" by Briony Forsberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions a "complex textiles manufacturing dataset" obtained from a New Zealand manufacturer of woollen carpets and rugs, indicating that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will examine the **Methodology section**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including its origin, the time period it covers, and the nature of the data. They specify that the dataset consists of 300 instances of products, with features related to raw material variables, manufacturing variables, and quality control variables.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **Related Work** section, where the authors discuss various methods and datasets used in similar studies. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one from the New Zealand manufacturer.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. In this case, the dataset is specific to the study and does not have a separate citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note the acknowledgment of the funding source, which is Bremworth Carpets and Rugs, New Zealand, as it may be relevant for context.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Textiles Manufacturing Dataset**: This dataset was obtained from a New Zealand manufacturer of woollen carpets and rugs, covering a period of three years. It includes 300 instances, with features related to raw material properties, manufacturing specifications, and quality control measures.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the context of the dataset and its relevance to the study.

Finally, I will prepare the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to provide proper attribution for the dataset's source:

Forsberg, B., Williams, H., MacDonald, B., Chen, T., Hamzeh, R., & Hulse, K. (2023). Utilising Explainable Techniques for Quality Prediction in a Complex Textiles Manufacturing Use Case. *Journal of Manufacturing Systems*, 4(2), 0-2.

Now, I will organize this information into a clear and concise output for further processing or review.
