To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Processing in Quantum Computers" by Aditya Dendukuri and Khoa Luu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss quantum image processing techniques**. The abstract mentions the exploration of image representation in quantum information, which suggests that there may be datasets related to image processing techniques or quantum image models.

Next, I will focus on the **sections discussing quantum image models and implementations**. In section 3, the authors describe various quantum image models, including the Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR). I will look for any specific datasets used to test these models or any datasets referenced in the context of their experiments.

In section 4 (Implementation and Results), the authors mention implementing FRQI on a 2x2 image, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. However, they refer to a simple 2x2 image with specific intensity values. I will note this as a dataset used for their experiments, even though it is not a traditional dataset with multiple samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets or methodologies that may have been used in their experiments. I will look for papers that might have provided datasets or benchmarks relevant to quantum image processing.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **2x2 Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of a single 2x2 image with the following intensity values:
   ```
   I = [[5.0, 2.0],
        [1.0, 3.0]]
   ```
   This dataset is used to demonstrate the implementation of the FRQI model.

2. **Quantum Image Models**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, the authors reference various quantum image models that could be considered as frameworks for future datasets. I will note these models and their respective citations.

For the citations, I will include the following:

- For the FRQI model:
  > P.Q. Dong, F. Hirota, K. "A flexible representation of quantum images for polynomial preparation, image compression, and processing operations." *Quantum Information Processing*, 10(1), 63-84, 2011.

- For the NEQR model:
  > Y. Zhang, K. Lu, Y. Gao, and M. Wang. "NEQR: a novel enhanced quantum representation of digital images." *Quantum Information Processing*, DOI 10.1007/s11128-013-0567-z.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted and attributed.
