To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Uncertainty in PET Image Reconstruction via Deep Posterior Sampling" by Tin Vlašić, Tomislav Matulić, and Damir Seršić, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **BrainWeb Dataset**: This dataset consists of MRI slices of 20 simulated brain volumes. The authors explain that ground-truth synthetic PET activity was simulated using the BrainWeb library. They provide details about the training and testing splits, as well as the dimensions of the MRI volumes.

2. **ADNI Dataset**: The authors describe a real-world dataset from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. They mention that this dataset includes slices used as S-PET ground truths and details about the number of subjects and slices involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **BrainWeb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chris A. Cocosco, Vasken Kollokian, Remi K-S Kwan, and Alan C. Evans. "Brainweb: Online interface to a 3D MRI simulated brain database." *NeuroImage*, 5(4), 1997. URL: http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/.

- For the **ADNI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
