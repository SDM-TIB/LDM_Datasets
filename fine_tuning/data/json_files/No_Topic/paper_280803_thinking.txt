To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Territory Design for Dynamic Multi-Period Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows" by Hernán Lespay and Karol Suchan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for computational experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their algorithms. In this section, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were constructed or sourced.

In the paper, the authors mention that they generated **56 small instances from VRPTW benchmark instances of Solomon** and constructed **15 large instances from the company’s historical monthly demand data**. This indicates that there are two main datasets of interest:

1. **Small TD-DMPVRPTW Instances**: These are derived from Solomon's VRPTW benchmark instances, which are well-known datasets in the vehicle routing literature. The authors specify that they used the first ten customers from these instances, maintaining their original demands, coordinates, time windows, and service times.

2. **Large TD-DMPVRPTW Instances**: These datasets are based on the company's historical demand data from January 2018 to March 2019. Each instance is characterized by a different number of customers and days, with specific details provided in Table 2 of the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Solomon's VRPTW benchmark instances**, the citation is:
  > Solomon, M. M. *Algorithms for the vehicle routing and scheduling problems with time window constraints*. Operations Research 35, 2 (1987), 254–265.

- For the **company's historical demand data**, since it is not a publicly available dataset, I will note that it is proprietary to the food distribution company in Chile and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citation for the Solomon dataset and note the proprietary nature of the company's data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
