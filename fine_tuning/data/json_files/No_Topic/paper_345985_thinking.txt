To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-task Framework for Infrared Small Target Detection and Segmentation" by Yuhang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **related work section**, specifically section II, where the authors discuss existing datasets for infrared small targets. Here, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **SIRST Dataset**: The authors state that they used the public SIRST dataset for experiments, which has accurate semantic segmentation annotations but rough object detection annotations. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Thermal Infrared Ship Detection Dataset**: They reference a dataset created by Li et al. for ship detection using the SDGSAT-1 thermal imaging system. This dataset is mentioned in the context of its high resolution and the challenges it presents.

3. **Dataset from Du et al.**: The authors refer to a dataset used for dim small target tracking under ground/air backgrounds, provided by another source. This dataset is noted for its redundancy due to similar backgrounds.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

- For the **SIRST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dai, Y., Wu, Y., Zhou, F., & Barnard, K. (2021). Asymmetric contextual modulation for infrared small target detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (pp. 950-959).

- For the **Thermal Infrared Ship Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, L., Jiang, L., Zhang, J., Wang, S., & Chen, F. (2022). A Complete YOLO-Based Ship Detection Method for Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Images under Complex Backgrounds. Remote Sensing, 14(1534).

- For the dataset from **Du et al.**, the citation is:
  > Du, J., Lu, H., Zhang, L., Hu, M., Chen, S., Deng, Y., et al. (2021). A Spatial-Temporal Feature-Based Detection Framework for Infrared Dim Small Target. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided the necessary citations for each.
