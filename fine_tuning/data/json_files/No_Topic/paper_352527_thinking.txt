To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HoW-3D: Holistic 3D Wireframe Perception from a Single Image" by Wenchao Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors propose an ABC-HoW benchmark created from CAD models sourced from the ABC dataset. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: the ABC dataset and the ABC-HoW dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction mentions the ABC-HoW dataset and its purpose for benchmarking the HoW-3D task, but I need to confirm the specifics in later sections.

In the **Datasets section (3)**, the authors provide detailed information about the ABC-HoW dataset. They describe it as containing 12,258 images rendered from 991 objects, split into training and testing sets. The training set has 11,179 images from 900 objects, while the testing set has 1,079 images from 91 objects. This section confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also mention that the ABC-HoW dataset is based on the **ABC dataset**. I will look for the full citation of the ABC dataset in the **References section**. The citation for the ABC dataset is:
> Koch, S., Matveev, A., Jiang, Z., Williams, F., Artemov, A., Burnaev, E., Alexa, M., Zorin, D., & Panozzo, D. (2019). ABC: A big CAD model dataset for geometric deep learning. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9601–9611.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **ABC-HoW Dataset**: This dataset is specifically created for the HoW-3D task, containing 12,258 images and corresponding 3D wireframe models. It is structured into training and testing splits to facilitate evaluation.

2. **ABC Dataset**: This dataset serves as the foundation for the ABC-HoW dataset, providing CAD models for rendering.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets:

- For the **ABC-HoW Dataset**, the citation is:
> Ma, W., Xue, N., Zheng, X., Tan, B., Wu, T., & Xia, G.-S. (2023). HoW-3D: Holistic 3D Wireframe Perception from a Single Image. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **ABC Dataset**, the citation is:
> Koch, S., Matveev, A., Jiang, Z., Williams, F., Artemov, A., Burnaev, E., Alexa, M., Zorin, D., & Panozzo, D. (2019). ABC: A big CAD model dataset for geometric deep learning. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9601–9611.

With this information gathered, I will now prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure for further processing.
