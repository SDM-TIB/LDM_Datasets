To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Stable Reduced-Order Models for Hybrid Twins" by Abel Sancarlos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the concept of "Hybrid Twin" and the use of data-driven models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (System to model and types of data)**, where the authors describe the system being modeled and the types of data used. Here, they mention three types of pseudo-experimental data provided by Dassault Aviation:

1. **Coarse Model (CM) Data**: This data corresponds to the predictions of a simplified model that does not provide accurate predictions.
2. **Ground Truth (GT) Data**: This data corresponds to the predictions of a high-fidelity model, which serves as the accurate representation of the system.
3. **Pseudo-Experimental Data (PED)**: This data includes white noise added to the GT data to simulate experimental measurements with errors.

In this section, the authors clearly outline the datasets they are using, which is crucial for my extraction process.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly provided for the datasets themselves, but I will look for the papers or reports that describe the CM and GT models, as well as any relevant documentation for the PED.

For the **Coarse Model (CM)** and **Ground Truth (GT)** data, I will note that they are derived from the modeling work done by Dassault Aviation, but specific citations may not be available in the paper. I will mention that these datasets are based on proprietary models developed by Dassault Aviation.

For the **Pseudo-Experimental Data (PED)**, I will also note that it is derived from the GT data with added noise, and thus does not have a separate citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Coarse Model (CM) Data**: Described as predictions from a simplified model.
2. **Ground Truth (GT) Data**: Described as predictions from a high-fidelity model.
3. **Pseudo-Experimental Data (PED)**: Derived from GT data with added noise.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of each dataset and any relevant citations or notes regarding their origins. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
