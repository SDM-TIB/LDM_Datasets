To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perception-Guided Quality Metric of 3D Point Clouds Using Hybrid Strategy" by Yujie Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention using **five independent databases** for their experiments. I will look for the names of these databases and any relevant details provided in the text.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SJTU-PCQA**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed metric. The authors mention it contains various types of distortions.

2. **WPC**: Another dataset used for performance evaluation, which includes point clouds generated from different types of distortions.

3. **M-PCCD**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation process, specifically for assessing the proposed metric's performance.

4. **ICIP2020**: This dataset is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted to validate the proposed method.

5. **LS-PCQA**: This dataset is mentioned as a large database with various types of distortions used for testing.

Now, I will look up the full citations for these datasets in the References section:

- For **SJTU-PCQA**, the citation is:

- For **ICIP2020**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
