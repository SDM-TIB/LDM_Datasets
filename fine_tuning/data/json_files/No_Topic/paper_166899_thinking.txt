To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of PPG Biometrics for Authentication in different states" by Umang Yadav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates PPG biometrics against various conditions, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of evaluating PPG biometrics under different emotional and physical states, hinting at the use of multiple datasets for this purpose. They mention that the system's performance is evaluated against variations using three different datasets, which is a clear indication that I need to identify these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. They specifically mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Capnobase Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8-minute single session data recorded in a relaxed condition from 42 subjects. The authors detail the training and testing procedures, including the evaluation metrics used.

2. **DEAP Dataset**: This dataset includes data recorded across 40 different emotional states for 32 subjects. The authors explain how they trained their model using data from one emotion and tested it against the rest of the dataset.

3. **BioSec.Lab PPG Dataset**: Developed at the University of Toronto, this dataset includes PPG signals recorded from subjects under different conditions, including relaxation and after intense exercise. The authors provide details about the sessions and the number of subjects involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Capnobase Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **DEAP Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **BioSec.Lab PPG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Biosec.lab PPG dataset. Available at: http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/˜biometrics/PPG_Dataset/. Last accessed on 21 Dec 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
