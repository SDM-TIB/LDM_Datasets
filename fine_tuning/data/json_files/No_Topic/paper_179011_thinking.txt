To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PAMPO: Using Pattern Matching and POS-Tagging for Effective Named Entities Recognition in Portuguese" by Conceição Rocha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the PAMPO method for named entity recognition but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for efficient methods to extract information from unstructured texts, particularly in the context of Portuguese language processing. They reference existing tools like Alchemy, Zemanta, and Rembrandt, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach and the evaluation procedures. They mention using a specific book about Portuguese Freemasonry as a case study, which suggests that this book may serve as a dataset for their experiments. However, I need to confirm if this book is formally cited as a dataset.

In the **results and evaluation sections**, the authors discuss the performance of PAMPO using two news corpora: one from the Lusa agency and another set of sports news. They provide statistics and comparisons with other named entity recognition tools, indicating that these corpora are used for evaluation purposes.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **Book on Portuguese Freemasonry**: This book is used as a case study for testing the PAMPO algorithm. However, the authors do not provide a full citation for this book in the text, so I will need to note that it is referenced but not formally cited.

2. **Lusa Agency News Corpus**: This dataset consists of 227 texts published by the Lusa agency. The authors do not provide a full citation in the paper, but they acknowledge the source.

3. **Sports News Corpus**: This dataset includes 881 sports news articles. Similar to the Lusa corpus, the authors do not provide a full citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of these datasets are mentioned there. The references primarily cite other research papers and tools but do not provide specific citations for the datasets used in this study.

Since the authors do not provide full citations for the datasets in the paper, I will note that the datasets are referenced but not formally cited. I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **Book on Portuguese Freemasonry**: Used as a case study for PAMPO, citation not provided.
- **Lusa Agency News Corpus**: 227 texts, citation not provided.
- **Sports News Corpus**: 881 articles, citation not provided.

Finally, I will prepare to document these findings in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
