To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resolving the Human Subjects Status of Machine Learningâ€™s Crowdworkers" by Divyansh Kaushik, Zachary C. Lipton, and Alex John London, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the reliance on crowdworkers for building datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the production of hundreds of new datasets in natural language processing (NLP) due to crowdsourcing. However, I need to look for specific dataset names or references.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their analysis or examples provided. The authors discuss various studies and cite specific works that involve crowdworkers, which may lead to dataset identification.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that are cited in the context of crowdworker studies. For instance, they mention studies by Khashabi et al. and Kaushik et al., which may have associated datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references section. For example, if the paper cites a dataset from Khashabi et al., I will look for the complete reference to that work.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their respective citations for clarity and completeness.
