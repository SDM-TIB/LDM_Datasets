To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The MCC Approaches the Geometric Mean of Precision and Recall as True Negatives Approach Infinity" by Jon Crall, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract primarily discusses the performance metrics of binary classifiers and does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the confusion matrix and evaluation metrics without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might discuss experiments or data used for analysis. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper does not present any empirical experiments or datasets. Instead, it focuses on theoretical insights regarding the relationship between the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and the Fowlkes-Mallows (FM) index.

Since there are no datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily consist of papers discussing evaluation metrics and methodologies, but they do not specify any datasets used in the context of this research.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.

In summary, I have thoroughly reviewed the paper and confirmed that it does not include any datasets for extraction. My final output will reflect this finding.
