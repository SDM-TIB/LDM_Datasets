To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwIPE: Efficient and Robust Medical Image Segmentation with Implicit Patch Embeddings" by Yejia Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluations on two tasks: 2D polyp segmentation and 3D abdominal organ segmentation, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **Kvasir-Sessile Dataset**: This dataset is used for training in the 2D polyp segmentation task and consists of 196 colored images of small sessile polyps.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**: This dataset is used to test model robustness in the same task.

3. **BCV Dataset**: This dataset is used for training in the 3D abdominal organ segmentation task and contains 30 CT scans with 13 annotated organs.

4. **AMOS Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate model robustness in the 3D segmentation task and consists of 200 training CT images.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kvasir-Sessile Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jha, D., Smedsrud, P.H., Johansen, D., de Lange, T., Johansen, H.D., Halvorsen, P., Riegler, M.A. (2021). A comprehensive study on colorectal polyp segmentation with ResUNet++, conditional random field and test-time augmentation. *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, 25(6), 2029–2040.

- For the **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., Vilarino, F. (2015). WM-DOVA maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians. *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, 43, 99–111.

- For the **BCV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, Y., Bai, H., Yang, J., Ge, C., Zhu, Y., Zhang, R., Li, Z., Zhang, L., Ma, W., Wan, X., et al. (2022). AMOS: A large-scale abdominal multi-organ benchmark for versatile medical image segmentation. *ArXiv:2206.08023*.

- For the **AMOS Dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
