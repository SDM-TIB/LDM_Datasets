To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Generalized Linear Model Reveals Those with High Intelligence are More Similar in Cortical Thickness" by Qi Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes structural brain imaging from the **Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Consortium**, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the ABCD Study as the source of their neuroimaging data, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the participants as being recruited from the ABCD Study, which is confirmed to be a large cohort of adolescents. They mention that the participants underwent quality control for neuroimaging data and behavioral tests, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or specific details about the ABCD Study. The authors provide demographic and background characteristics of the samples, which reinforces the significance of the ABCD dataset in their analysis.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the ABCD Study. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ABCD Study**, the citation is:
  > Casey, B. J., Cannonier, T., Conley, M. I., Cohen, A. O., Barch, D. M., Heitzeg, M. M., Soules, M. E., Teslovich, T. D., Dellarco, D. V., Garavan, H., Orr, C. A., Wager, T. D., Banich, M. T., Speer, N. K., Sutherland, M. C., Riedel, A. S., Dick, A. S., Bjork, J. M., Thomas, K. M., Chaarani, B., Mejia, M. H., Hagler, D. J., Cornejo, M. D., Sicat, C. S., Harms, M. P., Dosenbach, N. U. F., Rosenberg, M., Earl, E., Bartsch, H., Watts, R., Polimeni, J. R., Kuperman, J. M., Fair, D. A., Dale, A. M., and Workgrp, A. I. A. (2018). "The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study: Imaging acquisition across 21 sites." *Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience*, 32: 43-54.

Now, I will summarize the findings related to the dataset:

1. **Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Consortium**: This dataset includes neuroimaging data from a large cohort of adolescents, specifically focusing on structural brain imaging and cognitive assessments.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
