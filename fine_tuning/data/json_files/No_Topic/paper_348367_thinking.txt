To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Population-based Engagement Improve Personalisation? A Novel Dataset and Experiments" by Sahan Bulathwela et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **VLE dataset**, which consists of features extracted from scientific video lectures and engagement signals. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will read through the **introduction** to gather more context about the VLE dataset. The authors describe it as a large educational video dataset that includes around 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific video lectures from VideoLectures.NET. This section also highlights the dataset's focus on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence education, which is crucial for understanding its application.

In the **Datasets section (3)**, the authors provide detailed information about the VLE dataset, including its construction, features, and engagement labels. Here, I will note the following key points:

1. **VLE Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from video lectures available on VideoLectures.NET, focusing on various types of lectures, including scientific talks and tutorials. It includes features such as content-based textual features, Wikipedia topic-based features, and video-specific features. The dataset also provides multiple engagement labels based on user interactions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VLE dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly available, which is important for future research.

The citation for the VLE dataset is:
> Bulathwela, S., Verma, M., PÃ©rez-Ortiz, M., Yilmaz, E., & Shawe-Taylor, J. (2022). *Can Population-based Engagement Improve Personalisation? A Novel Dataset and Experiments*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2022.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VLE dataset. This will allow for easy reference and further exploration of the dataset in future research.

In summary, I have identified the VLE dataset as the primary dataset in the paper, noted its features and relevance, and retrieved its full citation for documentation purposes.
