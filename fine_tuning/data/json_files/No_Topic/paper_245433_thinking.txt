To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Goal-directed Human Attention Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Zhibo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of **COCO-Search18**, which is described as the largest dataset of high-quality search fixations. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors introduce **COCO-Search18** in the **experiments section**, where they provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of participants, images, and target categories. 

The key details about the dataset are as follows:
- **COCO-Search18**: This dataset consists of 6202 images with 10 participants searching for 18 target-object categories, resulting in approximately 300,000 goal-directed fixations. The dataset is specifically designed for evaluating the proposed inverse reinforcement learning model.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the COCO dataset is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Since COCO-Search18 is derived from the original COCO dataset, I will ensure to reference it correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, ensuring that it is clear and well-organized for any potential downstream processing or review.
