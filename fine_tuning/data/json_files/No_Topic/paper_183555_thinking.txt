To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NN-grams: Unifying neural network and n-gram language models for speech recognition" by Babak Damavandi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the NN-grams model and mentions that it is trained on **26B words**, which suggests a large corpus but does not specify a dataset name.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors describe their evaluation on two specific tasks: **voice-search (VS)** and **dictation (DTN)**. They mention that the test sets for these tasks consist of **12,877 utterances (27.4 hours, 47,867 words)** for voice-search and **12,625 utterances (19.2 hours, 82,121 words)** for dictation. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather descriptions of the test sets used in their experiments.

I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets or corpora in the **references section**. The authors mention that the models were trained on **anonymized and aggregated search queries and dictated texts**, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations for these sources.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets with full citations, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Voice-Search Dataset**: Contains **12,877 utterances** (27.4 hours, 47,867 words).
2. **Dictation Dataset**: Contains **12,625 utterances** (19.2 hours, 82,121 words).

However, I need to note that these datasets are not formally cited in the paper, and the authors do not provide specific references for them. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for these datasets as they are not publicly available datasets with established references.

In conclusion, while I have identified the datasets used in the experiments, I cannot provide full citations for them as they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. I will compile the information I have into a structured format for clarity, but I will note the lack of formal citations.
