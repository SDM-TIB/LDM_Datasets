To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models from High Dimensional Time Series" by Huitong Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for empirical validation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context and motivation for their research. If they reference any datasets, this will help me understand their relevance to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ADHD-200 dataset** for their empirical analysis. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including the number of subjects and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. For the ADHD-200 dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset in detail. The citation I find will be crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the ADHD-200 dataset is:
> Biswal, B. B., Mennes, M., Zuo, X.-N., Gohel, S., Kelly, C., Smith, S. M., Beckmann, C. F., Adelstein, J. S., Buckner, R. L., Colcombe, S., et al. (2010). Toward discovery science of human brain function. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 107(10), 4734â€“4739.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset identified in the paper.

In summary, my steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the ADHD-200 dataset and note its characteristics.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information for structured output.
