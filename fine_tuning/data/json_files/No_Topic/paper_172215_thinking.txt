To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A simple genome-wide association study algorithm" by Lev V. Utkin and Irina L. Utkina, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that numerical experiments were conducted with real datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data sets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and sources.

In section 4.1, the authors mention three datasets related to double haploid (DH) lines of barley. I will extract the following details for each dataset:

1. **First Dataset**: 
   - Description: 175 DH lines of barley analyzed with respect to the heading date trait.
   - Source: Data available at Oregon Wolfe Barley Data (OWBD) and GrainGenes Tools.
   - Linkage Map: Consists of 1328 SNPs.
   - Citation: 
     > Y. Chutimanitsakun et al. "Construction and application for QTL analysis of a restriction site associated DNA (RAD) linkage map in barley." BMC Genomics, 12:4:1–13, 2011.

2. **Second Dataset**: 
   - Description: 92 DH lines of barley from the Dicktoo x Morex cross, analyzed for heading date with and without vernalization.
   - Source: Data available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/DxM/.
   - Linkage Map: Consists of 117 SNPs.
   - Citation: 
     > A. Pan et al. "Genetic analysis of the components of winterhardiness in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)." Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 89(7-8):900–910, 1994.

3. **Third Dataset**: 
   - Description: 150 DH lines of barley from the Steptoe x Morex cross, analyzed for heading date and grain yield traits.
   - Source: Data available at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM.
   - Linkage Map: Consists of 223 SNPs.
   - Citation: 
     > T.J. Close et al. "Development and implementation of high-throughput SNP genotyping in barley." BMC Genomics, 10:582:1–13, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future analyses or documentation.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to confirm the accuracy of the citations and ensure that I have captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
