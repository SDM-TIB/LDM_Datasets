To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Asynchronous Control Using Meta-learned Neural Ordinary Differential Equations" by Achkan Salehi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluations in two different robot simulations and on a real industrial robot. I will look for specific names of these simulations or datasets in the text. For example, they refer to a **pybullet environment** and a **Gazebo Turtlebot3 simulation**. I will check if these environments are associated with specific datasets or if they are standalone simulations.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in the pybullet environment or the Gazebo simulation, I will ensure to note the full citation for that dataset. If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the references, I will summarize the information provided in the text regarding their origin and characteristics.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be easily referenced in future work or discussions.
