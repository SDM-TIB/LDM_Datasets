To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DASZL: Dynamic Action Signatures for Zero-shot Learning" by Tae Soo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the method on the **Olympic Sports** and **UCF101** datasets, which indicates that these are key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Olympic Sports Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for zero-shot action classification, and the authors cite the original work that introduced it.

2. **UCF101 Dataset**: Similar to the Olympic Sports dataset, this dataset is also used for zero-shot action classification, and the authors provide a citation for it as well.

3. **JIGSAWS Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing surgical activity data, which is used for joint segmentation and classification tasks. They also provide a citation for this dataset.

4. **DIVA Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of zero-shot activity recognition, and the authors describe its characteristics and challenges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **Olympic Sports Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **UCF101 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **JIGSAWS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gao, Y., Vedula, S. S., Reiley, C. E., Ahmidi, N., Varadarajan, B., Lin, H. C., ... & Hager, G. D. (2014). JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS): A Surgical Activity Dataset for Human Motion Modeling. In *Modeling and Monitoring of Computer Assisted Interventions (M2CAI) – MICCAI Workshop*.

- For the **DIVA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Oh, S., Hoogs, A., Perera, A., Cuntoor, N., Chen, C.-C., Lee, J. T., ... & Davis, L. (2011). A large-scale benchmark dataset for event recognition in surveillance video. In *CVPR 2011* (pp. 3153–3160). IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
