To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Style-Content Duality of Attractiveness: Learning to Write Eye-Catching Headlines via Disentanglement" by Mingzhe Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **public Kuaibao dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors describe the **Tencent Kuaibao Chinese News dataset**, which contains 160,922 training samples, 1,000 validation samples, and 1,378 test samples. They also mention that all samples have more than 20 comments, categorizing them as attractive cases, and they collected an additional 1,449 unattractive headlines from the same source.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kuaibao dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
> Qin, L., Liu, L., Bi, V., Wang, Y., Liu, X., Hu, Z., Zhao, H., & Shi, S. (2018). Automatic article commenting: the task and dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03668.

Since the unattractive headlines are derived from the same Kuaibao website, I will note that they are part of the same dataset contextually, but the primary dataset of interest is the Kuaibao dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Kuaibao dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the **Tencent Kuaibao Chinese News dataset**, and its full citation is provided above. I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
