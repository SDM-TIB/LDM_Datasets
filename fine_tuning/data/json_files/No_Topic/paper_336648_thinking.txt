To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiFi-VC: High Quality ASR-Based Voice Conversion" by Anton Kashkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the goal of voice conversion and the importance of datasets in achieving high-quality results. However, it does not specify any datasets directly. The introduction provides context about voice conversion but does not list any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention using the **VCTK dataset** for training their models. This dataset is described as containing 44,242 voice samples from 110 speakers, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **VCTK dataset** in the **References section**. The citation for the VCTK dataset is:
> Z. Liu and B. Mak. *Cross-lingual multi-speaker text-to-speech synthesis for voice cloning without using parallel corpus for unseen speakers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.11601, 2019.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to various baselines, but they do not introduce any new datasets beyond the VCTK dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: Used for training the proposed model, consisting of 44,242 voice samples from 110 speakers.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VCTK dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
