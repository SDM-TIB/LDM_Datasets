To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio Surveillance: a Systematic Review" by Marco Crocco et al., I will follow a structured approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it can hint at the types of data used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**, as these sections often detail the datasets used for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss various audio surveillance methods and may reference specific datasets used in their evaluations. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize datasets or experimental setups, as these often contain concise information about the datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "CUIDADO project" or "MPEG-7 standard," I will look for the corresponding references in the bibliography to ensure I have the complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following this systematic approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
