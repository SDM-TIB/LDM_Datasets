To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Dialog Generation with Cross-Domain Latent Actions" by Tiancheng Zhao and Maxine Eskenazi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on a "new synthetic dialog dataset" and an "existing human-human dialog dataset." This suggests that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Datasets for ZSDG)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **SimDial Data**: This is a synthetic dialog dataset developed by the authors, which generates realistic conversations for slot-filling domains. The paper provides details about the complexity and structure of the dataset, including the number of domains and dialogs generated.

2. **Stanford Multi-Domain Dialog Data (SMD)**: This dataset consists of 3031 human-human dialogs across three domains: weather, navigation, and scheduling. The authors describe how they use this dataset to validate their methods.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SimDial Data**, since it is a dataset developed by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Zhao, T., & Eskenazi, M. (2023). SimDial: A multi-domain dialog generator for zero-shot dialog generation. Available at: https://github.com/snakeztc/SimDial

- For **Stanford Multi-Domain Dialog Data**, the citation is:
  > Eric, M., & Manning, C. D. (2017). Key-value retrieval networks for task-oriented dialogue. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL), pages 1-10.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
