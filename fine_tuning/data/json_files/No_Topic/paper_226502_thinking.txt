To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argumentative Relation Classification as Plausibility Ranking" by Juri Opitz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the concept of argumentative relation classification but does not list any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the author discusses existing datasets for argumentative relation classification. Here, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **ESSAY Dataset**: This dataset consists of 402 argumentative student essays annotated with elementary argumentative units (EAUs) and over 3,000 relations among them. The authors reference two papers for this dataset:
   - Stab, C., & Gurevych, I. (2014). "Identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays." In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 46–56.
   - Stab, C., & Gurevych, I. (2017). "Parsing argumentation structures in persuasive essays." Computational Linguistics, 43(3), 619–659.

2. **Microtext Corpus**: This dataset covers a variety of political debates in Germany and is annotated with a fine-grained set of relations. The citation for this dataset is:
   - Peldszus, A., & Stede, M. (2016). "An annotated corpus of argumentative microtexts." In Argumentation and Reasoned Action - Proc. of the 1st European Conference on Argumentation, pages 1–10, Lisbon, 2015.

Additionally, the author mentions a variant of the ESSAY dataset called **ESSAY-CONTENT**, which is derived from the original ESSAY dataset but lacks discourse context. The citation for this variant is the same as that for the ESSAY dataset since it is based on the same essays.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ESSAY Dataset**:
  > Stab, C., & Gurevych, I. (2014). "Identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays." In Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 46–56.

  > Stab, C., & Gurevych, I. (2017). "Parsing argumentation structures in persuasive essays." Computational Linguistics, 43(3), 619–659.

- For the **Microtext Corpus**:
  > Peldszus, A., & Stede, M. (2016). "An annotated corpus of argumentative microtexts." In Argumentation and Reasoned Action - Proc. of the 1st European Conference on Argumentation, pages 1–10, Lisbon, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
