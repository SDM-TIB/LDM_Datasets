To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Exemplification in Long-form Question Answering via Retrieval" by Shufan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions a computational study of exemplification in QA and references three corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Exploring Exempliﬁcation)**, where the authors describe their data extraction process. They mention three datasets used for their study:

1. **ELI5 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing Reddit answers and is used for long-form question answering. The authors note that it has 65,157 training examples and 1,185 validation examples.

2. **Natural Questions (NQ) Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing Wikipedia passages and has 1,209 training examples and 52 validation examples.

3. **Books3 Dataset**: This is a large-scale dataset of books, with 2,848,171 training examples and 712,043 validation examples.

In the **statistics table (Table 1)**, the authors provide detailed statistics for the extracted example-in-context data, confirming the presence of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ELI5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fan, A., Jernite, Y., Perez, E., Grangier, D., Weston, J., & Auli, M. (2019). ELI5: Long form question answering. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 3558–3567, Florence, Italy.

- For the **Natural Questions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Kelcey, M., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Reimers, N., & Gurevych, I. (2019). Natural Questions: A benchmark for question answering research. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 453–466.

- For the **Books3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., & Leahy, C. (2020). The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
