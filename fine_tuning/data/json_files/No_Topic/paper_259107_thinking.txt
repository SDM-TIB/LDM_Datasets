To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Robust Algorithms for Online Allocation Problems Using Adversarial Training" by Goran Zuzic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the AdWords problem and mentions the use of adversarial training, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, the authors discuss the **AdWords problem** extensively, which is a well-known problem in online allocation. They may reference datasets related to this problem, such as those used in previous studies or benchmarks. I will also check if they mention any specific datasets used for training or testing their algorithms.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention the **AdWords dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If they refer to any other datasets, such as those used for benchmarking or comparison, I will do the same.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset, including its name, description, and citation.
