To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complex Evolutional Pattern Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning" by Zixuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a model for Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning, which suggests that datasets related to TKGs may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of TKG reasoning and reference various models and datasets. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used three datasets for evaluation: **ICEWS14, ICEWS18, and WIKI**. This section provides key statistics about each dataset, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

I will then check the **table (Table 1)** that summarizes the statistics of these datasets, including the number of entities, relations, and facts in the training, validation, and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **ICEWS14**, the citation is:
  > Boschee, E., Lautenschlager, J., O’Brien, S., Shellman, S., Starz, J., & Ward, M. (2015). *ICEWS Coded Event Data*. Harvard Dataverse, 12.

- For **ICEWS18**, the citation is:
  > Jin, W., Qu, M., Jin, X., & Ren, X. (2020). *Recurrent Event Network: Autoregressive Structure Inference over Temporal Knowledge Graphs*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 6669–6683.

- For **WIKI**, the citation is:
  > Leblay, J., & Chekol, M. W. (2018). *Deriving Validity Time in Knowledge Graph*. In Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference 2018, pages 1771–1776. International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
