To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation in Human Environments" by Jakob Thumm and Matthias Althoff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method using **human motion capture data**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of ensuring safety in environments with dynamic obstacles, hinting at the need for real-world data. The methodology section describes the use of a **safety shield** and mentions that the performance is demonstrated using **human motion capture data provided by CMU**. This is a clear indication of a specific dataset being utilized.

In the **results section**, the authors refer to two experiments: the **randomized-goal experiment** and the **human-evasion experiment**. They mention that the human motion data is taken from real-world motion capture data provided by CMU, specifically referencing **animation 62 01**, which contains a human performing a wrenching action. This provides a specific dataset name and context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CMU motion capture dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CMU Motion Capture Database**, the citation is:
  > "CMU Motion Capture Database." [Online]. Available: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/. [Accessed: Date].

This citation provides the necessary details for the dataset used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the CMU motion capture dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any downstream processing or documentation.
