To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Bayesian Detection of Spike Activities from Fluorescence Observations" by Zhuangkun Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of spike detection from fluorescence observations but does not specify any datasets. I will then check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology and results, but they do not explicitly list any datasets in a separate section. Instead, I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments within the **results or discussion sections**.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several studies and datasets indirectly through citations. I will compile a list of these references that pertain to datasets used for spike detection and fluorescence imaging.

1. **Calcium Imaging Data**: The authors mention using calcium imaging data for spike detection but do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they reference several studies that have utilized similar data:
   - T. Deneux et al. (2016) discuss spike estimation from noisy calcium signals, which can be considered a relevant dataset.
   - E. Pnevmatikakis et al. (2016) present a method for simultaneous denoising and deconvolution of calcium imaging data, which may also be relevant.

2. **MLSpike Dataset**: The authors compare their method to the MLSpike algorithm, which is based on a dataset used for spike detection. The original paper for MLSpike is:
   > T. Deneux et al. "Accurate spike estimation from noisy calcium signals for ultrafast three-dimensional imaging of large neuronal populations in vivo." *Nature Communications*, vol. 7, p. 12190, 2016.

3. **Other References**: The paper cites various studies that may involve datasets related to neuronal activity and fluorescence imaging, such as:
   - J. T. Vogelstein and A. M. Watson (2009) discuss spike inference from calcium imaging using sequential Monte Carlo methods.
   - E. Pnevmatikakis et al. (2013) provide insights into Bayesian spike inference from calcium imaging data.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets and studies referenced in the paper:

- For the calcium imaging data referenced:
  > T. Deneux, A. Kaszas, G. Szalay, G. Katona, T. Lakner, A. Grinvald, B. Rózsa, and I. Vanzetta. "Accurate spike estimation from noisy calcium signals for ultrafast three-dimensional imaging of large neuronal populations in vivo." *Nature Communications*, vol. 7, p. 12190, 2016.

- For the MLSpike method:
  > E. Pnevmatikakis, D. Soudry, Y. Gao, T. A. Machado, J. Merel, D. Pfau, T. Reardon, M. Yu, C. Lacefield, and W. Yang. "Simultaneous denoising, deconvolution, and demixing of calcium imaging data." *Neuron*, vol. 89, no. 2, pp. 285–299, 2016.

- For the spike inference method:
  > J. T. Vogelstein and A. M. Watson. "Spike inference from calcium imaging using sequential Monte Carlo methods." *Biophysical Journal*, vol. 97, no. 2, p. 636, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference in future work or analysis.
