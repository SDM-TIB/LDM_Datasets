To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BasicTAD: an Astounding RGB-Only Baseline for Temporal Action Detection" by Min Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on datasets like **THUMOS14** and **FineAction**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **THUMOS14**: This dataset contains 413 videos across 20 action categories, primarily sports-related, with temporal annotations for action instances.
2. **FineAction**: A newly collected dataset with 57,752 training instances from 8,440 videos, containing 106 action categories with a more detailed taxonomy.
3. **ActivityNet-v1.3**: A large-scale dataset with 10,024 training videos and 200 activities, focusing on long-term actions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **THUMOS14**, the citation is:
  > Jiang, Y.G., Liu, J., Roshan Zamir, A., Toderici, G., Laptev, I., Shah, M., Sukthankar, R. (2014). *THUMOS challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. Retrieved from http://crcv.ucf.edu/THUMOS14/.

- For **FineAction**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Ma, L., Zhang, Y., Liu, W., Chang, S. (2022). *FineAction: A fine-grained video dataset for temporal action localization*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 31, 6937–6950.

- For **ActivityNet-v1.3**, the citation is:
  > Heilbron, F.C., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., Niebles, J.C. (2015). *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In CVPR, pp. 961–970.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
