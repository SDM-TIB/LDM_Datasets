To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Attentions for Neural Machine Translation" by Haitao Mi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses improvements in translation and alignment quality, but does not specify datasets. The introduction mentions the use of alignments from training sentence pairs, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they ran experiments on a Chinese-to-English translation task using a training corpus consisting of approximately **5 million sentences** from the **DARPA BOLT Chinese-English task**. This indicates that the dataset is significant for their experiments.

I will also note the specific details provided about the dataset:
- The training corpus includes a mix of **newswire, broadcast news, and web blog** content.
- The authors specify that they do not include certain datasets like **HK Law, HK Hansard, and UN data**.

Additionally, the **development set** is mentioned as a concatenation of several tuning sets (GALE Dev, P1R6 Dev, and Dev 12), totaling **4491 sentences**. The **test sets** include:
- **NIST MT06** with **1664 sentences**,
- **MT08 news** with **691 sentences**,
- **MT08 web** with **666 sentences**.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or part of a larger project (DARPA BOLT). Therefore, I will note that the dataset is referenced as part of the DARPA BOLT project without a specific citation.

To summarize, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **DARPA BOLT Chinese-English Task Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 5 million sentences, including various types of content. It is used for training in the experiments described in the paper.

2. **Development Set**: A combination of several tuning sets totaling 4491 sentences.

3. **Test Sets**:
   - **NIST MT06**: 1664 sentences.
   - **MT08 news**: 691 sentences.
   - **MT08 web**: 666 sentences.

Since the datasets are part of the DARPA BOLT project, I will note that the citation for the project is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is a recognized dataset in the field of machine translation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations as needed.
