To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-Aware Learning with Restriction of Universal Dependency using f-Divergences" by Kazuto Fukuchi and Jun Sakuma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments in these sections. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are mentioned.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section, I will search through the **methods** and **results** sections for any references to datasets. Authors often describe their experimental setup, including the datasets used, in these parts of the paper.

Once I identify any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After gathering the dataset information, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Adult Income Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in external sources or databases to ensure I have the correct reference.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details and its corresponding citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a high standard of thoroughness and accuracy in my work.
