To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CS-VQA: Visual Question Answering with Compressively Sensed Images" by Li-Chi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the exploration of Visual Question Answering (VQA) using compressively sensed images, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments. The introduction provides context about the VQA task and references existing datasets, indicating that I should look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention using the **VQA dataset** and the **MS COCO dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

1. **VQA Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as consisting of image-question pairs, with a total of 248,349 questions for the training set and 121,512 questions for the validation set. This dataset is crucial for their experiments as it serves as the basis for evaluating their VQA models.

2. **MS COCO Dataset**: The paper states that the VQA dataset uses images from the MS COCO dataset, which contains 83,783 training images and 40,504 validation images. This dataset is well-known in the computer vision community and is often used for various tasks, including image captioning and object detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **VQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stanislaw Antol, Aishwarya Agrawal, Jiasen Lu, Margaret Mitchell, Dhruv Batra, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Devi Parikh. *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 2425–2433.

- For the **MS COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014, pp. 740–755.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
