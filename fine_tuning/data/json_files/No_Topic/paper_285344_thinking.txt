To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Averse Bayes-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning" by Marc Rigter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific tasks they are used for.

In this paper, the authors mention two domains for their experiments: the **Betting Game Domain** and the **Autonomous Car Navigation Domain**. I will extract details about these domains as they represent the datasets used in the experiments.

1. **Betting Game Domain**: The authors describe a scenario where an agent starts with a certain amount of money and can place bets. The dataset here is implicitly defined by the rules of the game and the probabilistic model used to simulate outcomes. However, there are no specific external datasets cited.

2. **Autonomous Car Navigation Domain**: This domain involves an autonomous car navigating through different types of roads. Similar to the Betting Game, the dataset is defined by the simulation parameters and the prior distributions over transition durations. Again, no external datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or external sources, I will note that the datasets are defined by the experimental setups rather than being traditional datasets that can be cited.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or foundational works that might have influenced the experimental design. However, it appears that the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own experimental designs rather than from established datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **Betting Game Domain**: No external dataset; defined by the rules of the game and probabilistic outcomes.
- **Autonomous Car Navigation Domain**: No external dataset; defined by simulation parameters and prior distributions.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will note that the experiments are based on custom simulations rather than established datasets. This is important for clarity in any documentation or reporting of the findings from this paper.
