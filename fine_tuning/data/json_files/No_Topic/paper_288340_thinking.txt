To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symmetry meets AI" by Gabriela Barenboima, Johannes Hirna, and Ver√≥nica Sanza, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly sections II and III, where the authors describe the experiments conducted. Here, I will look for any specific datasets that were generated or utilized, especially in the context of the decoy task and the classification of artworks. The authors mention using a physics-based setup for training algorithms, which may imply the creation of synthetic datasets.

In section III, the authors discuss applying their method to artworks, which suggests that they may have used a dataset of paintings or images for their analysis. I will look for any details about the source of these artworks, the number of images, and how they were processed.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset of artworks, I will need to find the original source or publication that describes this dataset. If they mention generating synthetic datasets based on physics templates, I will document the methodology used to create these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the dataset information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
