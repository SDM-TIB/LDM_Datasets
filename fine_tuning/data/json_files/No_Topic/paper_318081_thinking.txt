To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Aware Identity Cloning Detection based on Deep Forest" by Ahmed Alharbi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated against a "real-world dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed used, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the dataset they developed for their evaluation. They describe it as consisting of 4,030 public Twitter accounts, including 2,015 cloned accounts and their corresponding victim accounts, along with an additional 20,152 public Twitter accounts added as noise. This gives me the necessary details about the dataset's composition.

The authors also mention that the dataset was created using non-privacy-sensitive user profile attributes fetched from Twitter APIs. This is crucial information that helps define the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to their own work in the context of the dataset they created, which is cited as:
> Alharbi, A., Dong, H., Yi, X., Abeysekara, P.: NPS-AntiClone: Identity cloning detection based on non-privacy-sensitive user profile data. In: Proc. of IEEE ICWS (2021).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
