To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessment of a cost-effective headphone calibration procedure for soundscape evaluations" by Bhan Lam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for soundscape evaluations.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or stimuli that were used in the experiments. The authors discuss the importance of calibration methods and may refer to datasets related to soundscape evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled "Stimuli and calibration." Here, the authors mention a set of **27 audio stimuli** that were used in the Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP). This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I will need to gather more details about these stimuli.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional mentions of the datasets or stimuli used in the analysis. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the experiments and any relevant findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors may have cited previous works that describe the datasets or the specific stimuli used in their study.

For the **27 audio stimuli** used in the SATP, I will look for the following citation:
- **Soundscape Attributes Translation Project (SATP)**: The specific details about the dataset may not be fully cited in the paper, but I will reference the original source if available. If the authors have provided a DOI or a link to the dataset, I will include that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will ensure that the information is complete and can be referenced accurately in future work.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the relevant datasets from the paper and document them appropriately.
