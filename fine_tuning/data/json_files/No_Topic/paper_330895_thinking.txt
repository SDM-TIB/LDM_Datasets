To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Inverter Control by Learning the OPF Mapping using Sensitivity-Informed Gaussian Processes" by Mana Jalali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "real-world data on the IEEE 13- and 123-bus feeders," indicating that these are datasets relevant to the study. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and the data used for training and testing their models. I will pay close attention to any specific details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were generated or collected.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used "real-world minute-based active load and solar generation data from 446 households obtained from the Smart* Project collected on July 1 of 2011 and 2015." This provides a clear identification of one dataset.

Additionally, they refer to the "IEEE 13- and 123-bus benchmarks" as the systems on which they conducted their experiments. I will ensure to note these benchmarks as datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Smart* Project data is referenced, and I will need to locate the original source for this dataset. The IEEE benchmarks are standard datasets in power systems research, so I will note their common citations.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Smart* Project Data**:
   > Barker, S., Mishra, A., Irwin, D., Cecchet, E., Shenoy, P., & Albrecht, J. (2012). An open data set and tools for enabling research in sustainable homes. In Workshop on Data Mining Applications in Sustainability (SustKDD), Beijing, China, Aug. 2012, pp. 1â€“6.

2. **IEEE 13-bus and 123-bus benchmarks**:
   > Kersting, W. H. (2018). Distribution System Modeling and Analysis. New York, NY: CRC Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
