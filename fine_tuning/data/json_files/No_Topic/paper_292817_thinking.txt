To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instance Level Affinity-Based Transfer for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Astuti Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of domain adaptation and mention that they validate their method on multiple benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results and Analysis)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **Digits Dataset**: This dataset includes images of handwritten digits from three sources: SVHN, MNIST, and USPS. The authors explore adaptation tasks between these datasets, specifically MNIST → USPS, USPS → MNIST, and SVHN → MNIST.

2. **Office-31 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from 31 categories across three domains: Amazon (A), Webcam (W), and DSLR (D). The authors report results for all six task pairs formed from these domains.

3. **Birds-31 Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-grained adaptation and consists of images from three domains: CUB-200-2011 (C), NABirds (N), and iNaturalist2017 (I). The authors mention that it contains 1848 images from CUB-200-2011, 2988 images from NABirds, and 2857 images from iNaturalist2017.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **Digits Dataset**, I will reference the original sources for SVHN, MNIST, and USPS.
- For the **Office-31 Dataset**, I will find the citation that describes the dataset and its creation.
- For the **Birds-31 Dataset**, I will locate the citation for the CUB-200-2011 dataset and any relevant references for NABirds and iNaturalist2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
