To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An AI tool for automated analysis of large-scale unstructured clinical cine CMR databases" by Jorge Mariscal-Haran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development and validation of an AI tool for analyzing clinical CMR datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for training and validation of their AI tool. They mention:

1. **NHS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3207 CMR scans from two NHS hospitals, annotated by clinical fellows and reviewed by accredited CMR consultants.

2. **Duke Dataset**: This dataset includes 1319 clinical CMR scans from the Duke Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Center.

3. **UK Biobank Dataset (UKBB)**: This dataset contains 4872 CMR scans, which are publicly available for approved research projects.

4. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 CMR scans, also publicly available.

5. **M&Ms Dataset**: This dataset includes 375 CMR scans, publicly available for research.

6. **M&Ms-2 Dataset**: This dataset contains 360 CMR scans, also publicly available.

In the **Results section**, the authors validate their tool using these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **UK Biobank Dataset**:
  > Petersen SE, Matthews PM, Francis JM, Robson MD, Zemrak F, Boubertakh R, et al. *UK Biobank’s cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol*. J Cardiovasc Magn Reson. 2015;18:8.

- For the **ACDC Dataset**:
  > Campello VM, Gkontra P, Izquierdo C, Martin-Isla C, Sojoudi A, Full PM, et al. *Multi-Centre, Multi-Vendor and Multi-Disease Cardiac Segmentation: The MMs Challenge*. IEEE Trans Med Imaging. 2021;40:3543–54.

- For the **M&Ms Dataset**:
  > Martín-Isla C, K. L. *Multi-Disease, Multi-View & Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI (M&Ms-2)*.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ready for review or further processing.
