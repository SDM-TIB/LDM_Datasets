To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beam Profiler Network (BPNet) - A Deep Learning Approach to Mode Demultiplexing of Laguerre-Gaussian Optical Beams" by Amit Bekerman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep neural networks for mode demultiplexing, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for reliable methods for sorting or demultiplexing spatial optical modes, hinting at the use of datasets for training their models. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Data generation)**, where the authors describe the datasets they created. They mention two types of datasets: 

1. **DBnum**: This dataset consists of numerically generated Laguerre-Gaussian modes and their superpositions. The authors specify that it includes datasets marked as DBnumN, where N indicates the number of superimposed modes (N = 1, 2, 3). Each dataset contains 36N members, and they augment this dataset significantly for training.

2. **DBexp**: This dataset consists of experimentally generated Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Similar to DBnum, it is marked as DBexpN, where N also indicates the number of superimposed modes. The authors describe how they generated this dataset and augmented it as well.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that they used both DBnum and DBexp datasets for training and testing their models, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are generated by the authors themselves, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper:

- For **DBnum** datasets, the authors describe them as consisting of numerically generated images of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, with augmentation techniques applied to increase the dataset size.

- For **DBexp** datasets, the authors describe them as consisting of experimentally acquired images of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, also augmented for training purposes.

Since these datasets are not published in a separate paper, I will create a citation format that reflects their origin in this research paper:

- For **DBnum**:
  > Amit Bekerman, Sahar Froim, Barak Hadad, and Alon Bahabad. *Beam Profiler Network (BPNet) - A Deep Learning Approach to Mode Demultiplexing of Laguerre-Gaussian Optical Beams*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

- For **DBexp**:
  > Amit Bekerman, Sahar Froim, Barak Hadad, and Alon Bahabad. *Beam Profiler Network (BPNet) - A Deep Learning Approach to Mode Demultiplexing of Laguerre-Gaussian Optical Beams*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ready for review or further processing.
