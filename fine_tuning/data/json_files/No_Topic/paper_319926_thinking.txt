To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shift Happens: Adjusting Classifiers" by Theodore James Thibault Heiser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors mention using **OpenML** to obtain datasets for their experiments. They describe the criteria for selecting datasets, such as the number of instances and the requirement for predicted scores to be within a certain range. They also mention that they compiled a prediction matrix from various models trained on different subsets of folds.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to OpenML, which is a platform that hosts a variety of datasets. Therefore, I will need to find the specific datasets used from OpenML and their corresponding citations.

The relevant datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **OpenML Datasets**: The authors used multiple datasets from OpenML, specifically mentioning that they compiled predictions from 590 sets of predictions across 59 different runs from 56 different classification tasks. However, the paper does not specify the exact names of these datasets.

To provide a complete citation for OpenML, I will refer to the following source:
> Vanschoren, J., van Rijn, J.N., Bischl, B., & Torgo, L. (2013). OpenML: Networked science in machine learning. *SIGKDD Explorations*, 15(2), 49-60.

Since the paper does not specify individual datasets, I will note that the datasets are sourced from OpenML, and the citation above serves as the reference for the platform.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for OpenML as the source of the datasets used in the experiments.
