To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient online cross-covariance monitoring with incremental SVD: An approach for the detection of emerging dependency patterns in IoT systems" by Xinmiao Luan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the proposed method through simulation studies and a case study on semiconductor manufacturing processes, indicating that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors describe the context of their work, focusing on data from interconnected systems in semiconductor manufacturing. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets yet.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any references to data collection or datasets used in the simulations. The authors mention that they consider two interconnected systems generating multivariate data, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **simulation studies section**, I will look for details about the data used in the simulations. The authors describe various simulation setups but do not provide specific dataset names. They mention that the data characteristics vary across setups, but still, no explicit datasets are identified.

In the **case study section**, the authors discuss the application of their method to semiconductor manufacturing, specifically mentioning overlay and thickness maps. They describe how these measurements are represented as multivariate data but do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

Finally, I will check the **data availability statement** and **references section** for any datasets that might be cited. The data availability statement indicates that the data supporting the findings are available upon request, but no specific datasets are listed.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the types of data and the context in which they operate, they do not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets used in their research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that the paper discusses data from semiconductor manufacturing processes and mentions overlay and thickness maps, but it does not provide specific datasets or citations. I will document this finding accordingly.
