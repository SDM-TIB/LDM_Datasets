To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Agent Policies with Interpretable Imitation Learning" by Tom Bewley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the paper to find specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Implementation with a Traffic Simulator)**, as it is likely to contain details about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe their implementation in a traffic simulator and mention the creation of a training dataset derived from the recorded history of vehicle states and actions.

I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources. The authors state that they generated a training dataset with a length of 125,000 by applying their feature-generating operations to the observed state-action history. However, they do not reference any external datasets or publicly available datasets in this section.

Since the paper focuses on a simulation-based approach, it appears that the dataset is generated from the simulation itself rather than sourced from an existing dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is a synthetic one created for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or methodologies that could be relevant. However, it seems that the references primarily cite foundational works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Training Dataset**: The dataset is generated from a traffic simulator, consisting of 125,000 instances of state-action pairs derived from the simulation of vehicle behaviors.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will not provide additional citations. The focus is on the synthetic dataset created for the study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
