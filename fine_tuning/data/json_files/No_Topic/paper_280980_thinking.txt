To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Acronym Identification and Disambiguation Shared Tasks for Scientific Document Understanding" by Amir Pouran Ben Veyseh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions two shared tasks, AI@SDU and AD@SDU, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **Dataset & Task Description section**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they created. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **SciAI**: This dataset consists of 17,506 sentences from 6,786 English papers published in arXiv, specifically designed for acronym identification. It includes annotations for acronyms and their long forms.

2. **SciAD**: This dataset is created for acronym disambiguation and contains 62,441 sentences. It is derived from the SciAI dataset and includes mappings of acronyms to their long forms.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SciAI**, the citation is:
  > Pouran Ben Veyseh, A., Nguyen, T. H., & Dou, D. (2020). What Does This Acronym Mean? Introducing a New Dataset for Acronym Identification and Disambiguation. In Proceedings of COLING.

- For **SciAD**, since it is derived from the SciAI dataset and does not have a separate citation, I will reference it as part of the SciAI dataset's citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
