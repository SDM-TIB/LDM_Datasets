To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep CNNs along the Time Axis with Intermap Pooling for Robustness to Spectral Variations" by Hwaran Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the effectiveness of the proposed architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **Switchboard-I Release 2 (SWBD)** dataset, the **Wall Street Journal (WSJ)** corpus, and the **Aurora4 database**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset.

In the experiments setup, the authors specify that the SWBD dataset is used for conversational telephone speech tasks, while the WSJ corpus is used for read speech tasks. The Aurora4 database is a subset of the WSJ that includes clean utterances mixed with noise types and microphone distortions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SWBD dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. J. Godfrey, E. C. Holliman, and J. McDaniel. “SWITCHBOARD telephone speech corpus for research and development.” In Proceedings of the 1992 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, vol. 1, pp. 517–520, 1992.

2. For the **WSJ corpus**, the citation is:
   > D. B. Paul and J. M. Baker. “The Design for the Wall Street Journal-based CSR Corpus.” In Proceedings of the Workshop on Speech and Natural Language, 1994.

3. For the **Aurora4 database**, the citation is:
   > D. Povey, A. Ghoshal, G. Boulianne, L. Burget, O. Glembek, N. Goel, M. Hannemann, P. Motlicek, Y. Qian, P. Schwarz, J. Silovsky, G. Stemmer, and K. Vesely. “The kaldi speech recognition toolkit.” In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, pp. 1–4, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
