To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developing Social Robots with Empathetic Non-Verbal Cues Using Large Language Models" by Yoon Kyung Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the development of empathetic non-verbal cues in social robots, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work and design sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The paper describes the development of a conversational robot and mentions testing with actual users in simulated academic counseling sessions. However, it does not specify any datasets in these sections.

I will then focus on the **user evaluation section**, where the authors discuss the alignment scores and the data collected from participants. They mention that the test data were collected from two participants, but again, there is no explicit dataset name provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the studies referenced. The references primarily consist of studies on empathy, human-robot interaction, and non-verbal cues, but they do not point to specific datasets used in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or explicitly name any datasets in their research. Instead, they conducted their experiments based on their own developed framework and data collected from participants during the study.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have retrieved their full citations from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
