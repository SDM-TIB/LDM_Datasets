To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enhanced Device-to-Device Communications" by Zelin Ji and Zhijin Qin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep Q-network (DQN) for optimizing the position and phase shift of RIS in D2D communications, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for numerical results or simulations. This section typically provides details on the datasets employed for testing the proposed methods. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they describe a simulation environment and parameters for their model, such as the number of D2D pairs, cellular users, and the configuration of the RIS. This suggests that the authors may have created a synthetic dataset or used a simulation framework rather than relying on publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any prior works are referenced that might include datasets relevant to the study. However, the references primarily consist of previous research articles and do not point to any specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enhanced Device-to-Device Communications" by Zelin Ji and Zhijin Qin, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
