To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CoQAR: Question Rewriting on CoQA" by Quentin Brabant et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that CoQAR is a corpus containing 4.5K conversations from the Conversational Question-Answering dataset CoQA, which indicates that CoQA is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in **section 3 (CoQAR)** and **section 2 (Related Work)**. In section 3, the authors describe CoQAR as an annotated subset of the CoQA corpus, which is crucial for my extraction.

In **section 2**, the authors mention the **CoQA dataset** and provide a brief overview of its characteristics. They also reference the **CANARD dataset**, which is another dataset relevant to their work. I will need to note both of these datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **CoQA Dataset**:

2. **CANARD Dataset**:
   > Elgohary, A., Peskov, D., and Boyd-Graber, J. (2019). Can You Unpack That? Learning to Rewrite Questions-in-Context.

Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or processing.
