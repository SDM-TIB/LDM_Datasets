To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards the Right Kind of Fairness in AI" by Boris Ruf and Marcin Detyniecki, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses fairness metrics and the "Fairness Compass" tool, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of bias in AI but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine the **sections on fundamentals, problem of bias, and available fairness definitions**. These sections focus on theoretical concepts and do not seem to reference any datasets directly. 

I will then look into the **examples and applications** provided in the paper, particularly in the sections discussing fairness definitions and the "Fairness Compass." Here, the authors illustrate concepts using hypothetical scenarios, such as fraud detection in insurance claims, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Finally, I will check the **conclusion and references** sections to see if any datasets are cited indirectly or if any references point to datasets used in related studies. The references primarily consist of literature on fairness and bias in machine learning, but do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The paper focuses more on theoretical frameworks and tools rather than empirical studies that would require specific datasets.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. If I were to find datasets in a similar paper, I would follow the same steps: read through the relevant sections, identify any named datasets, and then look for full citations in the references section to ensure proper documentation.
