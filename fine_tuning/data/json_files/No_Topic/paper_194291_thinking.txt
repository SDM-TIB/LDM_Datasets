To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An exact and two heuristic strategies for truthful bidding in combinatorial transport auctions" by Tobias Buer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the bidding strategies are evaluated using a **computational study based on 174 benchmark instances**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. The introduction discusses the relevance of combinatorial transport auctions and mentions that the computational study is based on benchmark instances. I will need to find out what these benchmark instances consist of.

In the **methodology section**, the author describes the generation of benchmark instances, which includes a set of requests tendered by the auctioneer and a set of bundle bids from rival carriers. This suggests that the datasets are related to transport requests and bidding strategies.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional details about the datasets used in the experiments. The paper states that 240 instances were generated, with varying numbers of requests and bids, which provides context for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Benchmark Instances**: The paper mentions that the computational study is based on 174 benchmark instances, which are easily extendable by other researchers. The instances consist of a set of requests tendered by the auctioneer and a set of bundle bids submitted by rival carriers.

2. **Dataset Citation**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for the benchmark instances, but it references the use of popular instances from the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) introduced by Christofides et al. (1979). Therefore, I will include this reference as the citation for the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Christofides, N., Mingozzi, A., Toth, P., & Sandi, C. (1979). The vehicle routing problem. In Combinatorial Optimization (pp. 315-338). Wiley.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation for future reference.
