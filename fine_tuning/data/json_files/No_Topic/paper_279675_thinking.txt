To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Notes on Deep Learning Theory" by Evgenii (Eugene) Golikov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in the research.

2. **Identifying Datasets**: As I read, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. I will pay special attention to sections that discuss experiments, results, or methodologies, as these are likely to contain dataset information.

3. **Extracting Information**: If I find any datasets mentioned, I will note down the following details for each dataset:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., size, type of data).
   - **Citation**: I will look for the full citation of the dataset, which may be found in the references section of the paper or within the text itself.

4. **Cross-Referencing**: If the dataset is not described in detail in the paper, I will cross-reference with the references section to find the original source or paper that describes the dataset. This is crucial for providing accurate citations.

5. **Documenting Datasets**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset. This will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

6. **Final Review**: After compiling the datasets, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness, checking that all necessary details are included and that citations are correctly formatted.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract and document the datasets from the research paper effectively and accurately.
