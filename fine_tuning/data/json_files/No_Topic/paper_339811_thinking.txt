To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Reward Maximization and Population Estimation: Sequential Decision-Making for Internal Revenue Service Audit Selection" by Peter Henderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize real data from the IRS, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **data section**, where the authors describe the data used for their analysis. They mention that the data comes from the **National Research Program (NRP)** audits, which is a key dataset for their study. They also provide details about the structure of the NRP sample, including the number of audits conducted each year and the covariates used.

In addition to the NRP dataset, the authors mention two other datasets that can act as proxies for IRS data:
1. **Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)** from the United States Census Bureau, which is referenced as a dataset that can be used for running their code.
2. **Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)** of the Current Population Survey (CPS), also from the United States Census Bureau.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **National Research Program (NRP)**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is important to note that it is a dataset maintained by the IRS.
- For the **Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)**, the citation is:
  > United States Census Bureau. *Public Use Microdata Sample*. https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2018/5-Year/csv_hca.zip.
  
- For the **Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)**, the citation is:
  > United States Census Bureau. *2019 Annual Social and Economic Supplements*. https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2019/demo/cps/cps-asec-2019.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
