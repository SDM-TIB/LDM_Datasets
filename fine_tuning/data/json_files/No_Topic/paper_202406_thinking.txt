To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A real-time reactive framework for the surgical case sequencing problem" by Belinda Spratt and Erhan Kozan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract mentions a case study of a large Australian public hospital, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to surgical cases, waiting lists, and patient data.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Case Study)**, where the authors describe the data used for computational experiments. Here, they mention that the data is a combination of real case study data and randomly generated data due to confidentiality. They also refer to a specific dataset used for testing the model, which is crucial for my extraction.

In **section 5.1 (Data and Parameters)**, the authors provide details about the data required for the experiments, including the waiting list, elective requests, non-elective requests, and cancellations. They specifically mention that six problem instances were generated using historical data to verify and validate computational performance, and they cite the dataset as [dataset] (Spratt and Kozan, 2018). This indicates that there is a formal citation for the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation provided is:
> Spratt, B., Kozan, E. (2018). Operating Theatre Data. Retrieved from Mendeley Data. doi: 10.17632/sccbx9jzp5.1

This citation is essential for documenting the dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. The dataset I will extract is:

1. **Operating Theatre Data**: This dataset includes historical data related to surgical cases, waiting lists, elective and non-elective surgery requests, and cancellations from a large Australian public hospital.

The full citation for this dataset is:
> Spratt, B., Kozan, E. (2018). Operating Theatre Data. Retrieved from Mendeley Data. doi: 10.17632/sccbx9jzp5.1

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
