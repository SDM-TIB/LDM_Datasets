To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Deep Learning to Enhance Breast Cancer Detection on Screening Mammography" by John D. Miller et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **datasets section** is likely where the authors will detail the datasets used in their research.

In the **datasets section (III)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Curated Breast Imaging Subset (CBIS-DDSM)**: This dataset consists of digitized screen-film mammograms from 1566 participants, including both craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. It contains 761 cancer cases that are pathologically confirmed, with regions of interest (ROIs) annotated. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD)**: This dataset includes 3728 full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs) from 1775 patients, with both MLO and CC views. All patients have malignant or benign tumors, confirmed by biopsy, but there is no ROI-level annotation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CBIS-DDSM**, the citation is:
  > Lee, R. S., Gimenez, F., Hoogi, A., et al. (2017). A curated mammography data set for use in computer-aided detection and diagnosis research. *Scientific Data*, 4(1), 170177.

- For **DDSM**, the citation is:
  > Heath, M., Bowyer, K., Kopans, D., et al. (2001). The Digital Database for Screening Mammography. In *Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Digital Mammography*, 212-218.

- For **CMMD**, the citation is:
  > Cui, C., Li, L., Cai, H., et al. (2020). The Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD): An online mammography database with biopsy confirmed types for machine diagnosis of breast. *The Cancer Imaging Archive*.

- For **TCIA**, the citation is:
  > Clark, K., Vendt, B., Smith, K., et al. (2013). The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA): Maintaining and Operating a Public Information Repository. *Journal of Digital Imaging*, 26(6), 1045-1057.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.
