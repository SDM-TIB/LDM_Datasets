To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond RMSE: Do machine-learned models of road user interaction produce human-like behavior?" by Aravinda Ramakrishnan Srinivasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for analysis. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental methods section**, particularly **section II.A (Dataset)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention the **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset**, which includes both highway and urban driving trajectories. They specify that only the highway driving trajectories were used for their analysis.

I will then look for any additional details about the dataset, such as the specific locations where the data was collected. The authors mention that the highway driving data was collected from two different highway locations in the USA: the US101 and I80 highways. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

After identifying the dataset, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the NGSIM dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Colyar, J. (2021). *Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Vehicle Trajectories*. Retrieved from https://data.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Next-Generation-Simulation-NGSIM-Vehicle-Trajector/8ect-6jqj

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset**: This dataset includes highway driving trajectories collected from the US101 and I80 highways. The authors used only the highway driving portion for their analysis.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
