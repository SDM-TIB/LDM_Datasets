To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Visual Grounding" by Erik Conser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the "IRSG dataset" and the "Visual Relationship Dataset (VRD)," indicating that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the IRSG system and its associated dataset. They mention that they will examine the IRSG dataset and the VRD dataset, which suggests that both are significant for their experiments.

In **section 3 (Revisiting IRSG)**, the authors describe the IRSG dataset in detail, noting that it consists of 5,000 images, with 4,000 for training and 1,000 for testing. They also mention that the dataset was annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers, which is important for understanding its construction.

Additionally, in **section 4 (Revisiting "Referring Relationship" Grounding)**, the authors refer to the VRD dataset, which is used for evaluating the performance of visual grounding systems. They highlight that the VRD dataset is commonly used in visual relationship detection tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **IRSG dataset**, the citation is:
   > Justin Johnson, Ranjay Krishna, Michael Stark, Li-Jia Li, David Shamma, Michael Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Image retrieval using scene graphs*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3668–3678, 2015.

2. For the **Visual Relationship Dataset (VRD)**, the citation is:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Ines Chami, Michael Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Referring relationships*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 6867–6876, 2018.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their details, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow me to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
