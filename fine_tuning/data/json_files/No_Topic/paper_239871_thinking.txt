To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Features Are Equal: Discovering Essential Features for Preserving Prediction Privacy" by Fatemehsadat Mireshghallah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any details about their characteristics or the tasks they are used for.

In the **experimental results subsection (5.1.1 Dataset Specifications)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their evaluations. They mention four datasets:

1. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, annotated with 40 attribute labels.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
3. **UTKFace**: A dataset containing over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity.
4. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images of digits from 0 to 9.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned are:

- **CelebA**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. [n.d.]. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- **UTKFace**:
  > Zhifei Zhang, Yang Song, and Hairong Qi. *Age Progression/Regression by Conditional Adversarial Autoencoder*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *The MNIST Dataset Of Handwritten Digits*. [n.d.]. http://www.pymvpa.org/datadb/mnist.html.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset used in the research paper.
