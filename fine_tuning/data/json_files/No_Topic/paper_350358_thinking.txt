To extract datasets from the research paper titled "My View is the Best View: Procedure Learning from Egocentric Videos" by Siddhant Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a novel dataset called **EgoProceL**, which is a strong lead for my extraction.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly **section 3 (EgoProceL: Egocentric Video Dataset for Procedure Learning)**. Here, the authors describe the **EgoProceL dataset**, which consists of 62 hours of egocentric videos captured by 130 subjects performing 16 tasks. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its purpose and the tasks involved.

Additionally, the authors mention that the **EgoProceL dataset** was constructed using videos from other publicly available datasets, specifically **CMU-MMAC**, **EGTEA Gaze+**, **MECCANO**, and **EPIC-Tents**. I will need to extract these datasets as well, as they contribute to the EgoProceL dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **EgoProceL Dataset**:
   - Citation: The authors do not provide a specific citation for EgoProceL since it is their own dataset, but they mention that it is available on their project page.

2. **CMU-MMAC**:
   - Citation: De La Torre, F., Hodgins, J., Bargteil, A., Martin, X., Macey, J., Collado, A., & Beltran, P. (2008). *Guide to the Carnegie Mellon University Multimodal Activity (CMU-MMAC) database*. Robotics Institute.

3. **EGTEA Gaze+**:
   - Citation: Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G.M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., & Wray, M. (2018). *Scaling Egocentric Vision: The EPIC-KITCHENS Dataset*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

4. **MECCANO**:
   - Citation: Ragusa, F., Furnari, A., Livatino, S., & Farinella, G.M. (2021). *The MECCANO Dataset: Understanding Human-Object Interactions From Egocentric Videos*. In Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

5. **EPIC-Tents**:
   - Citation: Jang, Y., Sullivan, B., Ludwig, C., Gilchrist, I., Damen, D., & Mayol-Cuevas, W. (2019). *EPIC-Tent: An Egocentric Video Dataset for Camping Tent Assembly*. In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Workshops.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation for future reference or processing.
