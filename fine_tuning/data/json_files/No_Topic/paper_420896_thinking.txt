To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models Are Semi-Parametric Reinforcement Learning Agents" by Danyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on two RL task sets, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors describe the evaluation of their proposed framework. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **WebShop**: This dataset simulates a web store site and includes over 1 million products crawled from Amazon, with about 12,000 product requests rewritten by crowd laborers to generate diverse instructions.

2. **WikiHow**: This dataset is based on the collaborative wiki app WikiHow and contains navigation tasks where the agent is instructed to follow instructions to navigate to required pages.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **WebShop**, the citation is:
> Shunyu Yao, Howard Chen, John Yang, and Karthik Narasimhan. *Webshop: Towards scalable real-world web interaction with grounded language agents*. CoRR, abs/2207.01206, 2022. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2207.01206. URL https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2207.01206.

For **WikiHow**, the citation is:
> Danyang Zhang, Lu Chen, and Kai Yu. *Mobile-Env: A universal platform for training and evaluation of mobile interaction*. CoRR, abs/2305.08144, 2023. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08144.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources for any future reference or analysis.
