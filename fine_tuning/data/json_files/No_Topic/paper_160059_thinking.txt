To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Robust Search Strategies Using a Bandit-Based Approach" by Wei Xia and Roland H. C. Yap, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of bandit-based learning techniques but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned. The authors describe their experiments using various benchmarks and problem instances. They mention using benchmarks from the CSP solver competition and specify that they used 363 problem instances from 15 problem series. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations in this section.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. The authors discuss various adaptive CSP search strategies and mention several methods and algorithms, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will look at the **References section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the experiments conducted in this paper. The references include various papers on constraint programming and search heuristics, but they do not directly mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the use of benchmarks and problem instances, they do not provide specific dataset names or full citations for any datasets used in their experiments. Therefore, I will note that no explicit datasets were extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper discusses the use of benchmarks and problem instances from the CSP solver competition but does not provide specific dataset names or citations.
- No datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper.

This process highlights the importance of thoroughly reviewing all sections of a research paper to identify datasets, as they may not always be clearly labeled or cited.
