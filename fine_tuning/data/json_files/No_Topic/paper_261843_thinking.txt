To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Embedded Model Estimator for Non-Stationary Random Functions Using Multiple Secondary Variables" by Colin Daly, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses an algorithm for non-stationary spatial modeling but does not explicitly mention any datasets. This indicates that I need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the author discusses the challenges of modeling non-stationary data and mentions the use of secondary variables, but again, no specific datasets are cited. This suggests that I should continue to the methodology and results sections.

I will then focus on the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that might detail the datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm. In this section, the author describes the algorithm and its application but does not provide specific dataset names.

Next, I will look into the **results** section, where the author presents examples and applications of the algorithm. Here, I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or descriptions that might reference datasets. The author mentions a synthetic model and real case studies, but I need to confirm if specific datasets are cited.

I will also check the **references** section for any datasets that might be referenced indirectly through other studies or papers. This is crucial because datasets may not always be named directly in the text but could be cited through related works.

After thoroughly reviewing these sections, I will compile the datasets I find, ensuring to include full citations for each. If I find datasets mentioned in the context of examples or case studies, I will note their details and the corresponding citations.

For instance, if I identify a dataset used in a case study, I will document it as follows:

1. **Synthetic Reservoir Model Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the algorithm's performance in a controlled environment. The citation for this dataset would be:
   > Daly, C. (2021). An application of an embedded model estimator to a synthetic non-stationary reservoir model with multiple secondary variables. *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence*, DOI: https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2021.624697.

2. **Real Case Study Dataset**: If the paper references a real-world application, I will note the dataset used and provide the citation:
   > Daly, C., Hardy, M., & McNamara, K. (2020). Leveraging machine learning for enhanced geostatistical modelling of reservoir properties. In *EAGE*, Amsterdam. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.202011723.

Once I have gathered all relevant datasets and their citations, I will ensure that they are clearly documented for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help me extract the necessary information efficiently and accurately.
