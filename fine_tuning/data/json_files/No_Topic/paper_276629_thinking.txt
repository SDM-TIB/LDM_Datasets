To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aging-induced fragility of the immune system" by Eric Jones et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for analysis or validation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets, such as **Methods**, **Results**, or **Experiments**. These sections often describe the datasets used in the study, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to specific datasets or databases, I will record their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper mentions any datasets that are derived from other studies or databases, I will also look for the original sources of those datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and further analysis.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
