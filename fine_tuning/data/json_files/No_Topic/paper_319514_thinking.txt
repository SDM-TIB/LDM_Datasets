To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Time-Varying VAR Models: Estimation, Testing and Impulse Response Analysis" by Yayi Yan, Jiti Gao, and Bin Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical relevance of the proposed methods through an application to the transmission mechanism of U.S. monetary policy, which suggests that there may be datasets related to U.S. economic indicators.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors likely use economic data to illustrate their methods. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that may reference datasets or data sources.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **quarterly observations of three macroeconomic variables**: inflation rate, unemployment rate, and interest rate. They state that these data are collected from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis economic database, which is a crucial detail for citation.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **U.S. Inflation Rate Dataset**: This dataset includes quarterly observations of the inflation rate, measured by the year-over-year log change in the GDP deflator.

2. **U.S. Unemployment Rate Dataset**: This dataset contains quarterly observations of the unemployment rate, representing the non-policy block in their analysis.

3. **U.S. Interest Rate Dataset**: This dataset includes quarterly observations of the average value for the Federal funds rates over the quarter, which serves as the monetary policy block.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The authors likely reference the original sources of these datasets, which is essential for proper citation.

The citations I find are:

- For the **U.S. Inflation Rate Dataset**:
  > Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average." Available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCNS.

- For the **U.S. Unemployment Rate Dataset**:
  > Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. "Civilian Unemployment Rate." Available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE.

- For the **U.S. Interest Rate Dataset**:
  > Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. "Effective Federal Funds Rate." Available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented for future reference or analysis.
