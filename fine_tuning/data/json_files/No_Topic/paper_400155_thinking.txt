To extract datasets from the research paper titled "System-level Testing of the Congestion Management Capability of a Hardware-Independent Optimal Power Flow Algorithm" by Thomas Schwierz et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of an Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm in a low-voltage test setup, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the testing of this algorithm.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or data sources used in their experiments. The introduction highlights the challenges of integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) and mentions the need for testing methods, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the **test case** and **test specification**, the authors describe the components of the test setup and the data obtained from various assets in the Smart Grid Technology Lab (SGTL). Here, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the OPF algorithm. 

The paper lists several components and their corresponding data in **Table I**, which includes measurements from various assets such as:
- **OLTC (On-Load Tap Changer)**: tap position, phase to ground voltage, etc.
- **PV Inverter**: three-phase power, voltage, etc.
- **Battery Storage System (BSS)**: charging current, state of charge, etc.
- **Charging Station (CS)**: active and reactive power, etc.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for analysis or comparison, particularly in relation to the performance of the OPF algorithm.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or methodology from another paper, I will ensure to include that citation as well.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their descriptions in the methodology section.
3. Check the results section for any additional dataset references.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section for each dataset mentioned.
5. Compile the dataset information with citations for clarity and completeness.
