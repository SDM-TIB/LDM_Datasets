To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Activity Recognition on Time Series Accelerometer Sensor Data using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks" by Chrisogonas O. Odhiambo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected sensor data from 10 participants while consuming pizza and also reference comparable data for smoking and medication-taking, as well as jogging. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Background and Method section**, particularly subsection B, which discusses the data acquisition process. Here, the authors explicitly mention four sets of activities: eating, smoking, medication-taking, and jogging. They describe how they collected data for eating (pizza) and the other activities, but I need to find specific dataset names and details.

In this section, the authors mention that the eating activity data was collected from 10 participants using smartwatches, while the jogging activity data was sourced from an open public dataset from the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) Lab. This indicates that the WISDM dataset is one of the datasets used in their study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Eating Activity Dataset**: The authors collected this dataset themselves, so I will note it as:
   > Odhiambo, C. O., Saha, S., Martin, C. K., & Valafar, H. (2023). Human Activity Recognition on Time Series Accelerometer Sensor Data using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. *Journal of Computer Science & Engineering*.

2. **WISDM Dataset**: The citation for the WISDM dataset is:
   > Kwapisz, J. R., Weiss, G. M., & Moore, S. A. (2010). Activity recognition using cell phone accelerometers. *ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter*, 12(2), 74-82.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
