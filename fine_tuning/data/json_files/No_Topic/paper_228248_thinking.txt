To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eavesdrop the Composition Proportion of Training Labels in Federated Learning" by Lixu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating attacks on various tasks and datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a table (Table II) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and the models used for evaluation.

In Table II, I find the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 training images of handwritten digits, with 10 labels corresponding to the digits 0-9. The models used are MLP and CNN.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. The models used for evaluation are LeNet5 and ResNet18.

3. **Fer2013**: This dataset contains approximately 28,700 facial images for emotion recognition, classified into 7 labels. The model used is ResNet18.

4. **HAM10000**: A dataset of nearly 37,000 dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, classified into 7 labels. The model used is ResNet18.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations I find are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11): 2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

- For **Fer2013**:
  > Ian J. Goodfellow, Dumitru Erhan, Pierre Luc Carrier, Aaron Courville, Mehdi Mirza, Ben Hamner, Will Cukierski, Yichuan Tang, David Thaler, Dong-Hyun Lee, et al. *Challenges in representation learning: A report on three machine learning contests*. International Conference on Neural Information Processing, pages 117–124, 2013.

- For **HAM10000**:
  > Philipp Tschandl, Cliff Rosendahl, and Harald Kittler. *The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions*. Scientific Data, 5:180161, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details as presented in the research paper.
