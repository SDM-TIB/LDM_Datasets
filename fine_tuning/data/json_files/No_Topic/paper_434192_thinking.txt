To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Locally Robust Semiparametric Approach to Examiner IV Designs" by Lonjezo Sithole, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the analysis, including their characteristics, size, and any specific features that are relevant to the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to this part, as it is likely to provide comprehensive information about each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and their relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research or verification.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Kling (2006) dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Kling, Jeffrey R. (2006). "Incarceration Length, Employment, and Earnings." *American Economic Review*, 96(3), 863-876. doi: 10.1257/aer.96.3.863.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear format for easy reference, making sure that it is ready for any further analysis or documentation needs.
