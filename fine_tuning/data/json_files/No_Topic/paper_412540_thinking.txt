To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Canaries and Whistles: Resilient Drone Communication Networks with (or without) Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Chris Hicks et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a public challenge for learning network resilience strategies, which suggests that there may be a dataset or environment involved.

Next, I will focus on the **background and motivation sections** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or environments used in their research. In section 2.3, they mention the **CybORG AI gym**, which is described as a platform for training defensive RL-based agents. This indicates that CybORG is a significant dataset or environment for their experiments.

I will then look at the **environment section** where the authors detail the CAGE challenge, which utilizes the CybORG environment. They describe the specifics of the challenge, including the number of drones and the nature of the malware, but I need to confirm if they provide a formal citation for the CybORG dataset.

In the **references section**, I will locate the citation for the CybORG environment. The relevant citation is:
> Maxwell Standen, Martin Lucas, David Bowman, Toby Richer, Junae Kim, and Damian Marriott. *CybORG: A Gym for the Development of Autonomous Cyber Agents*. In 1st International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense (IJCAI ’21), 2021.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **CAGE challenge** multiple times, but it appears to be an application of the CybORG environment rather than a separate dataset. 

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **CybORG AI gym**: 
   - Citation: Maxwell Standen, Martin Lucas, David Bowman, Toby Richer, Junae Kim, and Damian Marriott. *CybORG: A Gym for the Development of Autonomous Cyber Agents*. In 1st International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense (IJCAI ’21), 2021.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
