To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Only Time Will Tell: Credible Dynamic Signaling" by Egor Starkov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on any mentions of datasets or empirical studies that utilize specific datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the research context, while the introduction often outlines the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will pay close attention to any **methodology or results sections** where the author might describe the data collection process or the datasets used for analysis. This includes looking for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that define them.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets or empirical analysis**, I will examine this section thoroughly. Here, the author may provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken before analysis. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Dataset A" and provides a brief description, I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
- For "Dataset A," the citation could be:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
