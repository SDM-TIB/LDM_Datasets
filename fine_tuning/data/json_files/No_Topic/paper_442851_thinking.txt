To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frequency-Domain Data-Driven Predictive Control" by T.J. Meijer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a new predictive control scheme based on frequency-domain data, which suggests that there may be datasets related to frequency-response-function measurements.

Next, I will examine the **main results section** (Section 4) and the **numerical case study section** (Section 5) closely. These sections are likely to contain specific datasets used in the experiments. In Section 5, the authors describe a numerical case study involving an unstable single-input single-output (SISO) system, and they mention generating offline data using a multi-sine excitation signal. This indicates that there are datasets related to the input-output measurements of the system.

I will note the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **Multi-sine excitation data**: The authors describe generating offline data using a multi-sine signal with 16 frequencies. This data is crucial for their experiments and is likely to be referenced as a dataset.

2. **Frequency-response-function (FRF) measurements**: The paper discusses estimating the FRF based on the collected data, which is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to several foundational papers and methodologies that may provide context or original sources for the datasets used.

For the **multi-sine excitation data**, I will cite the relevant methodology or previous work that describes how such data is typically generated or used in control systems. 

For the **FRF measurements**, I will look for citations that discuss the theoretical background or previous studies that have utilized similar frequency-domain data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will include:
- The dataset name (e.g., Multi-sine excitation data)
- A brief description of the dataset (e.g., "Generated using a multi-sine signal with 16 frequencies for offline data collection.")
- The full citation for the methodology or foundational work related to the dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are formatted correctly and ready for downstream processing or review.
