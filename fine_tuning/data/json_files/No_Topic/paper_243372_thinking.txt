To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ESG2Risk: A Deep Learning Framework from ESG News to Stock Volatility Prediction" by Tian Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework on real data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their data collection and experimental setup. In section 3 (Evaluation), they mention extracting around **50,000 ESG-related news articles** from a collection of financial news spanning from **2003 to 2019**. This indicates that the dataset is based on ESG news articles linked to companies in two markets: **MSCI US** and **All Cap EU**.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **references sections** for any additional datasets or sources that may have been used. The authors discuss the implications of their findings on stock volatility, which may lead to further insights into the datasets used.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **ESG News Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately **50,000 ESG-related news articles** collected from various financial news sources between **2003 and 2019**. It is used to analyze the impact of ESG news on stock volatility.

2. **Market Data**: The dataset includes information from two different markets:
   - **MSCI US**
   - **All Cap EU**

Next, I will look for full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. However, since the ESG news dataset is a proprietary collection developed by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the authors' description of the dataset.

For the market data, I will check if there are any specific papers or sources cited that describe the datasets used for MSCI US and All Cap EU. If they are mentioned, I will extract their citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper, including the ESG news dataset and any market data sources.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
