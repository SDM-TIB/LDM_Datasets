To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Graph Structure and Label Dependencies Contribute to Node Classification in a Large Network of Documents," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces a new dataset called **WikiVitals**, which contains a large graph of 48,000 mutually referred Wikipedia articles classified into 32 categories. This indicates that WikiVitals is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of the datasets in the **experiments** or **datasets** section. In section 4.1, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the WikiVitals dataset, including its size, structure, and the methodology used for its creation. They mention that it consists of 48,512 vital Wikipedia articles, 2.3 million edges, and 32 categories, which confirms its significance in the study.

Additionally, the authors mention that they also evaluate their model on three classical benchmark datasets: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Pubmed**. I will need to gather details about these datasets as well, which are typically found in the same section or in the **results** section.

In section 4.2, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, categories, and features. This information is crucial for a complete understanding of each dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations can typically be found in the **references** section. For the datasets mentioned:

1. **WikiVitals**: Since this is a new dataset introduced in the paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Pirmin Lemberger and Antoine Saillenfest. *How Graph Structure and Label Dependencies Contribute to Node Classification in a Large Network of Documents*. Preprint, February 12, 2024.

2. **Cora**: The citation for the Cora dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

3. **Citeseer**: The citation for the Citeseer dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

4. **Pubmed**: The citation for the Pubmed dataset is:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation for clarity and completeness.
