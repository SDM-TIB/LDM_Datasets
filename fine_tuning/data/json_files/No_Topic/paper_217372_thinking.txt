To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Recommender Systems for AI-Driven Biomedical Informatics" by William La Cava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methods and experiments sections typically detail the datasets utilized for analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using a platform called PennAI to automate machine learning analyses, which hints at the datasets involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their methodology. They mention assessing recommender systems on **165 open-source classification datasets** from the **Penn Machine Learning Benchmark (PMLB)**. This is a key dataset that I need to note.

The paper also references the **MIMIC-III critical care database** in the context of developing predictive models for septic shock. This is another important dataset that I will include.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Penn Machine Learning Benchmark (PMLB)**, the citation is:
   > Randal S. Olson, William La Cava, Patryk Orzechowski, Ryan J. Urbanowicz, and Jason H. Moore. *PMLB: A Large Benchmark Suite for Machine Learning Evaluation and Comparison*. BioData Mining, 2017. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.00512.

2. For the **MIMIC-III critical care database**, the citation is:
   > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, May 2016. Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
