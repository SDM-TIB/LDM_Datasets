To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Beamforming for Terahertz Multi-Carrier Systems over Frequency Selective Fading" by Hang Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors used for their simulations or evaluations. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific conditions under which the data was collected.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive information about each dataset used in the research. I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from this section.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources that are cited as the source of the datasets.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will organize it clearly to ensure that each dataset is well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data sources that underpin the authors' findings.
