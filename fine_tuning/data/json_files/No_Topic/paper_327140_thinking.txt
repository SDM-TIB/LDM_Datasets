To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Learning of Images and Geometrics for Predicting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Status of Glioma" by Yiran Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of IDH mutation status in glioma patients and mention the use of multi-modal MRI data. This suggests that MRI datasets are involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Data preparation)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that they collected multi-modal MRI data from **389 glioma patients** from three cohorts available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and an additional in-house cohort with 117 patients. They also specify that they excluded 17 patients due to missing data, resulting in a final dataset of **372 patients**.

The paper references three specific datasets from TCIA, which I will need to identify and cite properly. The references to these datasets are found in the **References section** of the paper.

Now, I will look at the citations provided in the references to gather full citations for the datasets:

1. **TCGA-LGG Dataset**: 
   > Pedano, N., Flanders, A. E., Scarpace, L., Mikkelsen, T., Eschbacher, J. M., Hermes, B., ... Ostrom, Q. (2016). Radiology Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Low Grade Glioma [TCGA-LGG] collection. The Cancer Imaging Archive.

2. **TCGA-GBM Dataset**: 
   > Scarpace, L., Mikkelsen, T., Cha, S., Rao, S., Tekchandani, S., Gutman, D., Saltz, J. H., Erickson, B. J., Pedano, N., Flanders, A. E., Barnholtz-Sloan, J., Ostrom, Q., Barboriak, D., and Pierce, L. J. (2016). Radiology Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme [TCGA-GBM] collection [Data set]. The Cancer Imaging Archive.

3. **Ivy GAP Dataset**: 
   > Shah, N., Feng, X., Lankerovich, M., Puchalski, R. B., and Keogh, B. (2016). Data from Ivy GAP [Data set]. The Cancer Imaging Archive.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Dataset 1**: TCGA-LGG Dataset, which includes multi-modal MRI data from low-grade glioma patients.
- **Dataset 2**: TCGA-GBM Dataset, which includes multi-modal MRI data from glioblastoma multiforme patients.
- **Dataset 3**: Ivy GAP Dataset, which also contains relevant imaging data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical information while extracting datasets from the paper.
