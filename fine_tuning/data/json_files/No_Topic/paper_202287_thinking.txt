To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Read My Lips: Using Automatic Text Analysis to Classify Politicians by Party and Ideology" by Eitan Sapiro-Gheiler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research utilizes word-level statistical data from the US Congressional Record, which suggests that this is a primary dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the author describes the data used for the analysis. Here, it is mentioned that the study employs data compiled by Lauderdale and Herzog (2016) from the Congressional Record covering the 104th through 113th Senate sessions (1995-2014). This is a significant dataset for the research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **US Congressional Record** dataset, the citation is:
  > Lauderdale, B. E., & Herzog, A. (2016). Measuring Political Positions from Legislative Speech. *Political Analysis*, 24(03), 374-394. doi:10.1093/pan/mpw017

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of **DWN scores** (DWN1 scores) derived from voteview.com, which is another dataset relevant to the analysis. I will also look for its citation in the references.

The citation for the **DWN scores** dataset is:
- For the **DWN scores**, the citation is:
  > Lewis, J. B., et al. (2017). Voteview: Congressional Roll-Call Votes Database. Retrieved from https://voteview.com/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the full citations for both datasets, as they are crucial for proper attribution and future reference.
