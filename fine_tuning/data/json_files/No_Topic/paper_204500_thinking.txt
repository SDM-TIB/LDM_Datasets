To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharp Analysis of Learning with Discrete Losses" by Alex Nowak-Vila, Francis Bach, and Alessandro Rudi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5 in this case), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, features, or specific tasks they are used for.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of multilabel and ranking problems. I will identify the following datasets:

1. **CAL500**: A dataset for multilabel classification tasks.
2. **corel5k**: Another dataset used for multilabel classification.
3. **enron**: A dataset related to email classification.
4. **mediamill**: A dataset used for multilabel classification in media content.
5. **scene**: A dataset for scene classification tasks.
6. **yeast**: A dataset for multilabel classification in biological contexts.
7. **Ohsumed**: A dataset used for ranking tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details and citations accurately.
