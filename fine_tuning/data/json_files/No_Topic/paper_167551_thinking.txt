To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence Mining and Pattern Analysis in Drilling Reports with Deep Natural Language Processing" by JÃºlio Hoffmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the analysis of drilling reports, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these reports.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they mention that they utilized **9670 daily reports** written by drilling engineers from **303 oil wells**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the authors also provide details about the classification of reports into two groups: productive time (PT) and non-productive time (NPT). They specify that **112 out of 303 wells contain NPT reports**, which indicates a specific subset of the dataset that is relevant for their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is proprietary and provided by an energy company, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from an energy company and does not have a specific published reference.

To summarize, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Daily Drilling Reports Dataset**: This dataset consists of **9670 daily reports** from **303 oil wells**, classified into productive and non-productive time reports. The dataset is used for automatic classification of sentences in drilling reports.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is provided by an unnamed energy company.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the relevant details about the dataset and its source.
