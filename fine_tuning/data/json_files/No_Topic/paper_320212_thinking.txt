To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A-PIXELHOP: A GREEN, ROBUST AND EXPLAINABLE FAKE-IMAGE DETECTOR" by Yao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of A-PixelHop against various generative models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **Experiment I**, the authors mention a dataset consisting of 10 subsets, which includes both real and CycleGAN-generated images. They specifically mention the "horse2zebra" subset and note that there are over 36K images across 14 semantic categories. This indicates a dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

In **Experiment II**, the authors describe a dataset containing images synthesized by various generative models, including ProGAN, StyleGAN, and others. They mention that the training set consists of 720K real/fake image pairs, which is another significant dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can infer the following based on the generative models referenced:

1. **CycleGAN Dataset**: The CycleGAN model is referenced in the context of generating images. The original paper for CycleGAN is:
   > Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou, and Alexei A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017, pp. 1125–1134.

2. **ProGAN Dataset**: The ProGAN model is also referenced. The original paper for ProGAN is:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

3. **StyleGAN Dataset**: The StyleGAN model is mentioned as well. The original paper for StyleGAN is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 4401–4410.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
