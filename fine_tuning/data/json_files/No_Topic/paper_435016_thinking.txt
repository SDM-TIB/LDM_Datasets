To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Jump During Loss Switch in Solving PDEs with Neural Networks" by Zhiwei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the use of neural networks for solving PDEs but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors detail their experiments with various PDEs, including the Poisson problem, Burgers equation, heat equation, diffusion equation, and wave equation. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the traditional sense (like benchmark datasets).

Instead, the authors describe the training data they generated for their experiments. For instance, they mention using 5120 equidistant points as training data for the Poisson problem and 8192 points for the Burgers problem. However, these are not datasets in the conventional sense but rather synthetic data generated for the purpose of their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide full citations for any datasets, I will note the generated data points used in the experiments as follows:

1. **Poisson Problem Training Data**: 5120 equidistant points generated for training.
2. **Burgers Equation Training Data**: 8192 points sampled within the region for training.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the methods or equations referenced correspond to datasets. However, the references primarily cite theoretical works and previous studies on neural networks and PDEs, rather than datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any formal datasets or citations for datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- The paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets but instead generates synthetic training data for their experiments.
- The training data consists of equidistant points generated for specific PDE problems.

In conclusion, I will document the findings regarding the training data used in the experiments, but I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since none were referenced in the paper.
