To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical-Bayes Score for Discrete Bayesian Networks" by Marco Scutari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation study section** (Section 4), as this is where the author discusses the performance of different scoring strategies and may reference datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the author mentions using **10 reference Bayesian networks (BNs)**, which are likely the datasets of interest.

I will then look for a **table or list** that summarizes these reference BNs. In the provided text, there is a **Table 1** that lists the reference BNs along with their respective characteristics, such as the number of nodes (N), number of arcs (|A|), and number of parameters (p). This table is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in Table 1 are:

1. **ALARM**: 
   - N = 46, |A| = 37, p = 509

2. **ANDES**: 
   - N = 338, |A| = 223, p = 1157

3. **ASIA**: 
   - N = 8, |A| = 8, p = 18

4. **CHILD**: 
   - N = 25, |A| = 20, p = 230

5. **DIABETES**: 
   - N = 413, |A| = 602, p = 429409

6. **HAILFINDER**: 
   - N = 66, |A| = 56, p = 2656

7. **HEPAR2**: 
   - N = 123, |A| = 70, p = 1453

8. **INSURANCE**: 
   - N = 52, |A| = 27, p = 984

9. **PATHFINDER**: 
   - N = 135, |A| = 200, p = 77155

10. **PIGS**: 
    - N = 592, |A| = 442, p = 5618

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the source of the reference BNs as the **Bayesian Network Repository** by Marco Scutari, which is a key resource for these datasets.

The citation for the repository is:
> Scutari, M. (2012). Bayesian Network Repository. Retrieved from http://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the source of the datasets.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper and their respective details, along with the citation for the source of these datasets. This structured approach ensures that I have captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the research paper.
