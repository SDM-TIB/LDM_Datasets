To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-complexity Near-optimum Symbol Detection Based on Neural Enhancement of Factor Graphs" by Luca Schmid and Laurent Schmalen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. If such a section is present, I will extract the relevant information about each dataset.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their findings or performance evaluations.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Proakis A" for their experiments, I will note down its details and then look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly available, I may need to search for it in other literature or databases.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details accurately and comprehensively.
