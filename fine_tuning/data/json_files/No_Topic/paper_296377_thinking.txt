To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Communication-Efficient and Personalized Federated Lottery Ticket Learning" by Sejin Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves results under the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned. In this case, the paper primarily focuses on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for its experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

I will also look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly referenced in many papers, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation. The standard citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online] Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the CIFAR-10 dataset for my output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the CIFAR-10 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be structured according to the specified format for downstream processing or review.
