To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy and Fairness in Recommender Systems via Adversarial Training of User Representations" by Yehezkel S. Resheff et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a benchmark dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. They mention the importance of user representations in recommender systems, but I need to find specific dataset names.

In the **results section**, the authors explicitly mention the **MovieLens 1M dataset**. They describe it as containing 1,000,209 ratings from 6,040 users on 3,706 movies, along with demographic information such as age and gender for each user. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MovieLens 1M dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Harper, F. M. and Konstan, J. A. (2016). The movielens datasets: History and context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS), 5(4):19.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the results section for explicit dataset names.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper citations for them.
