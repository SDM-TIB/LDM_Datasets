To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Multi-Task Transferable Rewards via Variational Inverse Reinforcement Learning" by Se-Wook Yoo and Seung-Woo Seo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Proposed Method)** and **section V (Experiments)**, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the methodologies and datasets used for validation. In these sections, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two specific environments used for their experiments:

1. **MT10 Environment**: This environment consists of 10 random distinct scenarios, each with 50 randomized positions of the initial object and final goal. It is designed to test the multi-task learning capabilities of the proposed method.

2. **ML5 Environment**: This is a customized environment similar to MT10, which also includes multiple scenarios for testing multi-task transfer learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. However, since MT10 and ML5 are custom environments created for the study, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that these environments are part of the experimental setup developed by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and environments as follows:

- For **MT10 Environment**, I will note that it is a custom environment designed for multi-task learning, created by the authors of the paper.

- For **ML5 Environment**, I will similarly note that it is a custom environment for multi-task transfer learning, also developed by the authors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset or environment, including their descriptions and the context in which they were used in the research.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their significance in the research while providing proper citations where applicable.
