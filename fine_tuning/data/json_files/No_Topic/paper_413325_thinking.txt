To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PUG: Photorealistic and Semantically Controllable Synthetic Data for Representation Learning" by Florian Bordes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a new family of synthetic datasets called PUG, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Photorealistic Unreal Graphics (PUG) environments and datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they introduce four datasets:

1. **PUG: Animals**: This dataset contains 215,040 pre-rendered images using 70 animal assets, 64 backgrounds, 3 sizes, 4 textures, and 4 different camera orientations. It is designed for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization research.

2. **PUG: ImageNet**: This dataset includes 88,328 pre-rendered images using 724 assets representing 151 ImageNet classes, with various factors such as backgrounds, sizes, textures, and orientations. It serves as an additional benchmark for evaluating the robustness of image classifiers.

3. **PUG: SPAR**: This dataset consists of 43,560 images using 32 animal assets, 10 backgrounds, and variations in positions and textures. It is aimed at evaluating vision-language models (VLMs).

4. **PUG: AR4T**: This dataset contains 249,986 training images and 23,216 test images, focusing on attributes and relations for fine-tuning VLMs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, but it does mention that the datasets are based on assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace and Sketchfab. Therefore, I will cite the datasets as follows:

- For **PUG: Animals**:

- For **PUG: ImageNet**:

- For **PUG: SPAR**:

- For **PUG: AR4T**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant citations from the paper.
