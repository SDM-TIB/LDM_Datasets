To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning for Windows Malware Detection and Classification: Methods, Challenges and Ongoing Research," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to locate any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that likely contain detailed information about datasets.

In **section 1.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors discuss the importance of data collection for training machine learning models in malware detection. They mention various sources for collecting benign and malicious executables, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 1.1.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide an overview of available datasets used in the literature. They reference a table (Table 1) that summarizes several datasets, which is a strong indication that specific datasets are listed there.

Upon reviewing **Table 1**, I find the following datasets:

1. **Microsoft Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,868 malware samples collected before 2015. It is significant for its size and the number of malware families it represents.

2. **EMBER Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,050,000 samples collected between 2017 and 2018. It is noted for its comprehensive feature set and is widely used for training static machine learning models.

3. **SOREL-20M Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,724,997 samples collected from 2017 to 2019. It is another large-scale dataset that contributes to the field of malware detection.

4. **BODMAS Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,962,820 samples collected between 2019 and 2020. It is designed for learning-based temporal analysis of PE malware.

5. **Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge and includes a variety of malware samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **Microsoft Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lorenzo Cavallaro, Johannes Kinder, Feargus Pendlebury, and Fabio Pierazzi. "Are machine learning models for malware detection ready for prime time?" IEEE Security & Privacy, 21(2):53â€“56, 2023.

- For the **EMBER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hyrum S. Anderson and Phil Roth. "EMBER: An Open Dataset for Training Static PE Malware Machine Learning Models." ArXiv e-prints, 2018.

- For the **SOREL-20M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Harang and Ethan M. Rudd. "Sorel-20m: A large scale benchmark dataset for malicious PE detection." ArXiv e-prints, 2020.

- For the **BODMAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Limin Yang, Arridhana Ciptadi, Ihar Laziuk, Ali Ahmadzadeh, and Gang Wang. "Bodmas: An open dataset for learning based temporal analysis of PE malware." 2021.

- For the **Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Royi Ronen, Marian Radu, Corina Feuerstein, Elad Yom-Tov, and Mansour Ahmadi. "Microsoft malware classification challenge." ArXiv e-prints, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
