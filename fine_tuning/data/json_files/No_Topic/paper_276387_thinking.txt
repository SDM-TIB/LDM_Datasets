To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-criteria Analysis for Evaluation of Adaptive Radar Resource Management algorithms on a Naval setting with and without clutter" by Christophe Labreuche et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the evaluation of Radar Resource Management (RRM) algorithms but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Naval scenario)** and **section 3 (Results)**, as these sections are likely to contain details about the scenarios and metrics used for evaluation. In section 2, the authors describe the operational scenario involving various targets, including ballistic missiles, ships, and aircraft. However, they do not mention specific datasets or sources for these scenarios.

In section 3, the authors present results regarding tracking performance metrics, but again, there is no explicit mention of datasets used for these evaluations. The paper discusses the performance of two algorithms (A+STU and NA+NSR) in terms of metrics like track completeness and surveillance, but it does not provide a dataset name or citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to external datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works might refer to datasets. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing radar management and algorithms, rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no distinct datasets provided or referenced in this research. The authors focus on simulation scenarios rather than publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings, noting that while the paper discusses various radar scenarios and performance metrics, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in the research.
