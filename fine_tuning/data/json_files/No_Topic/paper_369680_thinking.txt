To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Valuing Distributed Energy Resources for Non-Wires Alternatives" by Nicholas D. Laws and Michael E. Webber, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the economic signals for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the need for non-wires alternatives but again does not specify datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to identify any datasets used in the case studies or examples. In the methodology, the authors describe a bilevel optimization framework and mention using a year of hourly loads, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to load profiles. However, specific dataset names are not provided.

I will also look at the **use-case examples** section, where the authors discuss the IEEE 13 bus distribution test system. This indicates that the IEEE 13 bus system is a dataset used for their analysis. I will need to confirm this in the references section for proper citation.

In the **results section**, the authors summarize the outcomes of their analysis but do not introduce new datasets. They refer back to the IEEE 13 bus distribution test system, which is crucial for their findings.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 13 bus distribution test system. The citation is typically found in the references, and I will ensure to include it in my dataset documentation.

The relevant dataset I have identified is:

1. **IEEE 13 Bus Distribution Test System**: This dataset is used for modeling and analyzing the distribution system's performance under various scenarios.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the IEEE 13 bus distribution test system:

- For the **IEEE 13 Bus Distribution Test System**, the citation is:
  > "IEEE 13 Bus Test System." IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2016. Available: https://www.ieee-pes.org.

With this information, I can now create a structured output that includes the identified dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
