To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-target and multi-stage liver lesion segmentation and detection in multi-phase computed tomography scans" by Abdullah F. Al-Battal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly the **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific details about the datasets, such as the number of subjects, types of scans, annotations, and any relevant characteristics that define the dataset.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Liver Lesion Dataset**: This dataset consists of contrast-enhanced 3-phase CT scans from 354 subjects, annotated by radiologists. Each subject has scans from arterial, delay, and venous phases, with varying lesion sizes and characteristics.

2. **BraTS19 Dataset**: This dataset contains MRI scans of the brain from 484 subjects, annotated for brain tumor segmentation. It includes multiple contrast scans and has been pre-processed for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Liver Lesion Dataset**, the citation is:
> Al-Battal, A.F., Duong, S.T.M., Tang, V.H., Tran, Q.D., Truong, S.Q.H., Phan, C., Nguyen, T.Q., An, C. "Multi-target and multi-stage liver lesion segmentation and detection in multi-phase computed tomography scans." Preprint (2024).

For the **BraTS19 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R. "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 34, 1993â€“2024, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
