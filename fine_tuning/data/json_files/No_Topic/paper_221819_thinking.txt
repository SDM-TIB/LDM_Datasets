To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coupled-Projection Residual Network for MRI Super-Resolution" by Chun-Mei Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on **three public MRI datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors specifically describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **Brats Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and consists of 102 T1-weighted MRI samples, each containing 155 image slices of size 240x240. The authors detail how they selected specific slices for high-resolution data.

2. **ATLAS Native Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) and contains 304 T1-weighted MRI samples. The authors explain that they segmented the image slices into groups to extract high-resolution images.

3. **ATLAS Standardized Dataset**: Another dataset from ATLAS, this one includes 229 T1-weighted MRI samples. Similar to the native dataset, the authors describe the process of extracting high-resolution images from the segmented slices.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **Brats Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). *The Cancer Genome Atlas*. Available: https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga.

- For the **ATLAS Native Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS). *ATLAS Dataset*. Available: https://github.com/npnl/ATLAS/.

- For the **ATLAS Standardized Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the native dataset since both are part of the ATLAS project.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
