To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-object Tracking with an Adaptive Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Filter" by Cong-Thanh Do et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that detail the experimental setup, as they often contain information about the datasets. If the authors refer to any standard datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any specific details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "MOTChallenge" for multi-object tracking, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> "MOTChallenge: A Benchmark for Multi-Object Tracking." Available at: [URL or DOI].

If the paper does not provide a full citation for a dataset, I will search for it online to ensure I can provide accurate and complete references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy review or further processing.
