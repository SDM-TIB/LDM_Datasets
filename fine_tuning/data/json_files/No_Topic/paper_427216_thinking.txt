To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VideoAgent: A Memory-augmented Multimodal Agent for Video Understanding" by Yue Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that VideoAgent demonstrates impressive performances on several long-horizon video understanding benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the evaluations of VideoAgent. Here, the authors mention that they conduct extensive evaluations on several video understanding tasks, specifically referencing three benchmarks: **EgoSchema**, **Ego4D Natural Language Queries**, and **NExT-QA**. This indicates that these benchmarks are datasets used for evaluation.

I will then look for specific descriptions of these datasets in the text. In the results section, the authors provide details about the performance of VideoAgent on these datasets, which confirms their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **EgoSchema**: The citation is:
   > Mangalam, K., Akshulakov, R., & Malik, J. (2024). EgoSchema: A diagnostic benchmark for very long-form video language understanding. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 36.

2. **Ego4D Natural Language Queries**: The citation is:
   > Grauman, K., Westbury, A., Byrne, E., Chavis, Z., Furnari, A., Girdhar, R., Hamburger, J., Jiang, H., Liu, M., Liu, X., et al. (2022). Ego4D: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), 18995–19012.

3. **NExT-QA**: The citation is:
   > Xiao, J., Shang, X., Yao, A., & Chua, T.S. (2021). NExT-QA: Next phase of question-answering to explaining temporal actions. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (CVPR), 9777–9786.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
