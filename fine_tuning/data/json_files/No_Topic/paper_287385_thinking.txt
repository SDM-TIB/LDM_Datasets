To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCert: Verification of Contextually Relevant Robustness for Neural Network Image Classifiers" by Colin Paterson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepCert using two benchmark datasets: **German Traffic Sign** and **CIFAR-10**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In **subsection 4.1**, they mention using a subset of the **German Traffic Sign benchmark**, which consists of images of traffic signs. They provide details about the number of samples in each class, which confirms the dataset's relevance.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors discuss the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, describing it as containing 60,000 32×32 color images across 10 classes. They also provide a table listing the class names, which further confirms the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **German Traffic Sign dataset**, the citation is:
   > Stallkamp, J., Schlipsing, M., Salmen, J., & Igel, C. (2011). *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 1453–1460. IEEE.

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **German Traffic Sign Dataset**: A dataset used for traffic sign recognition, containing images of various traffic signs, organized into classes based on the type of sign.

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32×32 color images divided into 10 classes, with 5,000 training images and 1,000 test images per class.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the datasets and their citations, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
