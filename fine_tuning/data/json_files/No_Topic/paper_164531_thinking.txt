To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Approaches to Distribution Regression" by Ho Chung Leon Law et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their methods on "illustrative toy datasets" and a "challenging problem of predicting age from images," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **IMDb-WIKI database** for age estimation, which consists of 397,949 images of 19,545 celebrities with corresponding age labels. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to a "synthetic dataset" created for testing their models, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. Since it is a synthetic dataset generated for the purpose of the study, I will note it but will not provide a formal citation.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the IMDb-WIKI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> R. Rothe, R. Timofte, and L. Van Gool. *Deep expectation of real and apparent age from a single image without facial landmarks*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), July 2016.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **IMDb-WIKI Database**: A dataset consisting of 397,949 images of 19,545 celebrities with corresponding age labels. This dataset is used for age estimation tasks.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors for illustrative purposes in their experiments. No formal citation is provided as it is not a publicly available dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
