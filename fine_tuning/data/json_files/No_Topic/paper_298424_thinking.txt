To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIDE: State Inference for Partially Observable Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" by Zhiwei Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its evaluation, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets or platforms mentioned.

In the experiments section, the authors mention evaluating their proposed algorithm on the **SMAC (StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge)** platform. This indicates that the SMAC platform is a dataset or testbed used for their experiments. I will need to confirm if there are any additional datasets mentioned.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or platforms mentioned. For the SMAC platform, I will look for the original paper or documentation that describes it in detail.

The citation for the SMAC platform is:
> Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, C. S. D. Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim G. J. Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, P. Torr, Jakob N. Foerster, and S. Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In AAMAS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or platform used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing.
