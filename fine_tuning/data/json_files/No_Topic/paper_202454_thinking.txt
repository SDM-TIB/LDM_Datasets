To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning-Based Decoding for Constrained Sequence Codes" by Congzhe Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning to constrained sequence codes but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. In this paper, the authors focus on the 4B6B code and its application in visible light communication, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the context of training or evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references primarily consist of foundational papers and previous works on constrained sequence codes and deep learning applications, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular paper. However, I will note that the authors discuss the use of DNNs for decoding and the implications for practical applications, which may suggest the use of synthetic datasets generated for their experiments, but these are not detailed in the text.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. If any datasets had been mentioned, I would have ensured to retrieve their full citations from the references section to include in the final output.
