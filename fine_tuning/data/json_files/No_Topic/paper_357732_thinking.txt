To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Lipschitz Neural Networks and Certified Robustness: A Boolean Function Perspective" by Bohang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method across multiple datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention using several benchmark datasets, including **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, **TinyImageNet**, and **ImageNet**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **related work section**, the authors may reference other datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant for understanding the context of their work. However, my primary focus will be on the datasets they directly used in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of any datasets that are not original to the authors but are widely recognized in the field. For example, the MNIST dataset is well-known, and I will ensure to provide its citation.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **MNIST**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, 2009.

3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.
   - Citation: Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*, CS 231N, 2015.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 1 million images across 1,000 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately.
