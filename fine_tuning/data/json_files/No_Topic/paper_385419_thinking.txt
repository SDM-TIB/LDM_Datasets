To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graphs Querying" by Arijit Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on knowledge graphs and their querying, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. If the paper includes a section specifically discussing datasets, it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

If there is no dedicated section, I will search through the **related work** and **benchmarks** sections, as these often reference datasets used in previous studies or evaluations. The **references section** will also be crucial for finding full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if I find a dataset like "DBpedia," I would note it down as follows:

- **DBpedia**: A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia, structured as a knowledge graph.
- **Citation**: Lehmann, J., Isele, R., Jakob, M., Jentzsch, A., Kontokostas, D., Mendes, P. N., Hellmann, S., Morsey, M., Kleef, P. v., Auer, S., & Bizer, C. (2015). DBpedia - A large-scale, multilingual knowledge base extracted from Wikipedia. *Semantic Web*, 6(2), 167-195.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's information, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete for future reference.

Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any datasets and that all entries are correctly formatted and cited.
