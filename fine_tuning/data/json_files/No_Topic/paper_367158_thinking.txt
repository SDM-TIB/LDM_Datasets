To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ColabNAS: Obtaining lightweight task-specific convolutional neural networks following Occamâ€™s razor" by Andrea Mattia Garavagno et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **Visual Wake Word dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely to be one of the key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Methods)**, where the authors describe the classification tasks and the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention five specific datasets:

1. **Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying images of melanoma skin cancer, consisting of 9,605 training images and 1,000 test images. It is publicly available on Kaggle under the title "Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10000 Images".

2. **Visual Wake Words Dataset**: This dataset, created by Chowdhery et al., is used to classify images based on human presence. It contains 115,000 training images and 8,000 test images, derived from the "minival ids".

3. **Animals-3 Dataset**: This dataset is a subset of the Animals-10 dataset, containing images of three species: horses, butterflies, and hens, with a total of 7,833 instances. It is also publicly available on Kaggle.

4. **Flowers-4 Dataset**: This dataset is another subset, containing images of four flower classes: dandelion, iris, tulip, and magnolia, with a total of 4,202 instances. It is publicly available on Kaggle.

5. **MNIST Dataset**: This well-known dataset consists of handwritten digits, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is a subset of a larger dataset available from NIST.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
