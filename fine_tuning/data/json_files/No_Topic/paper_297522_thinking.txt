To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Communication and Radar Sensing with ReconÔ¨Ågurable Intelligent Surfaces" by R.S. Prasobh Sankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to identify any specific datasets used in the simulations or analyses. In this paper, the authors discuss parameters used for simulations in **Table I**, which lists various parameters but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, it is crucial to check if any datasets are referenced in the context of the simulations.

I will also examine the **conclusion section** to see if the authors summarize their findings and mention any datasets that were critical to their results. If the datasets are not explicitly named in the main text, I will look for any references to datasets in the **references section** that might indicate where the data originated or how it was collected.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references and document it accordingly.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
