To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Continuity Postulate in Economic Theory: A Deconstruction and an Integration" by Metin Uyanik and M. Ali Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and results** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets or empirical data.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, applications, or theoretical frameworks. I will look for any specific datasets that are utilized to support the authors' arguments or findings. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. I will look for any papers, reports, or databases that are cited as sources for the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, the scope, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all the information is organized clearly, making it easy for others to understand the datasets used in the research and to access them if needed. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets and their significance in the context of the research paper.
