To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Self-Supervised Learning for Image Segmentation Task" by Lichun Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the **NY2D dataset** was used for performance evaluation, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors mention using the **NYU-Depth V2 dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 1,449 densely labeled pairs of aligned RGB and depth images, along with 407,024 labeled frames. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's content and structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The NYU-Depth V2 dataset is referenced in the context of its use in the paper, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation format.

The citation for the **NYU-Depth V2 dataset** is:
> Nathan Silberman and Rob Fergus. *Indoor Segmentation and Support Inference from RGBD Images*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NYU-Depth V2 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NYU-Depth V2 dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
