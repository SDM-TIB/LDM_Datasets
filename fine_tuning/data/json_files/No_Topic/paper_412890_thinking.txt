To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Order Matters in the Presence of Dataset Imbalance for Multilingual Learning" by Dami Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and the tasks they are used for.

In **section 4.1 (Neural Machine Translation)**, the authors mention using datasets from the **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation)** for their experiments. I will note the specific language pairs and the years associated with the datasets, as this information is crucial for accurate citation.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the authors mention using the WMT datasets for specific language pairs, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the following details:
- **Name**: The name of the dataset.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
- **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the paper effectively. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information while adhering to proper citation practices.
