To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Underwater Image Haze Removal and Color Correction with an Underwater-ready Dark Channel Prior" by Tomasz Łuczyński and Andreas Birk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on real-life data collected within the DexROV project, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe experiments conducted on three video datasets from different locations, specifically mentioning:

1. **An ROV cage**: This dataset consists of video footage recorded during the DexROV project trials in the Mediterranean Sea. The footage captures a vehicle approaching an ROV cage, highlighting visibility challenges in underwater conditions.

2. **The Gnalic shipwreck archaeological site**: This dataset includes video footage recorded by a diver descending towards the Gnalic shipwreck in the Adriatic Sea, showcasing the poor visibility conditions due to strong winds and rough seas.

3. **The DexROV mockup**: This dataset features video footage recorded during the DexROV project trials in the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on a mockup used for testing manipulation tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The paper references the DexROV project, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used.

The full citation for the DexROV project is not explicitly provided in the references, but the paper mentions that the project is funded under the EU Horizon2020 program. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are associated with the DexROV project, which is a significant context for the data used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and details for each dataset, along with any relevant citations that can be derived from the paper.

1. **Dataset: ROV Cage Video**
   - Description: Video footage of an ROV cage recorded during the DexROV project trials in the Mediterranean Sea.
   - Citation: DexROV project, funded under the EU Horizon2020 program.

2. **Dataset: Gnalic Shipwreck Video**
   - Description: Video footage recorded by a diver at the Gnalic shipwreck archaeological site in the Adriatic Sea, highlighting visibility challenges.
   - Citation: DexROV project, funded under the EU Horizon2020 program.

3. **Dataset: DexROV Mockup Video**
   - Description: Video footage recorded during the DexROV project trials in the Mediterranean Sea, focusing on a mockup for testing manipulation tasks.
   - Citation: DexROV project, funded under the EU Horizon2020 program.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly attributed to the DexROV project as the source of the data.
