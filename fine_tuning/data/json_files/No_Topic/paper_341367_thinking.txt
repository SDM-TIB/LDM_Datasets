To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Training Resources for GLAM: A Snapshot" by Andrew Darby et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, findings, and recommendations sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on AI training resources for the GLAM community, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets or specific resources. The introduction discusses the need for GLAM staff to apply machine learning effectively, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **method section**, I will look for details about how the authors collected their data. They mention gathering a collection of teaching and learning materials for machine learning, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

In the **findings section**, particularly under **3.4.2 Example Training Data**, the authors mention that some reviewed materials use GLAM data, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. They refer to a few examples of GLAM data used in training materials, such as the Wilson Center Digital Archive’s collection on Iran-Soviet relations, but again, no formal dataset citation is provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. However, the paper primarily discusses training resources and does not provide full citations for specific datasets used in the materials reviewed.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets with full citations, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Wilson Center Digital Archive’s collection on Iran-Soviet relations**: While this is mentioned as an example of GLAM data used in training materials, there is no formal citation provided in the paper.

Given this analysis, it appears that the paper does not contain specific datasets with full citations that can be extracted. Instead, it discusses the general landscape of AI training resources relevant to the GLAM sector without detailing individual datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to document in the required format.
