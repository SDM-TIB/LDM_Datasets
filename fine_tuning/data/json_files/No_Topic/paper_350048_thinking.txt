To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Method for Nested Composition Optimization" by Dewei Zhang and Sam Davanloo Tajbakhsh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or numerical studies section**. This section typically details the datasets used for evaluation and may include descriptions of their characteristics, such as size, type, and purpose.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the numerical studies, especially in section 4, where the authors conduct experiments. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Grid World" used in their experiments, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is well-known, I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are properly formatted according to academic standards.
