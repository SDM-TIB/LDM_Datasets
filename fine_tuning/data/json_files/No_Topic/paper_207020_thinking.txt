To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Feature Learning for Unsupervised Video Summarization" by Yunjae Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention two benchmark datasets: **SumMe** and **TVSum**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of videos they contain.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:
1. **SumMe**: Contains 25 user videos with various events, with lengths ranging from 1 minute to 6.5 minutes. Each video has annotations from multiple users, typically around 15, with a maximum of 18 users.
2. **TVSum**: Comprises 50 videos with lengths ranging from 1.5 to 11 minutes, each annotated by 20 users.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **SumMe**:
  > Gygli, M., Grabner, H., Riemenschneider, H., & Van Gool, L. (2014). Creating summaries from user videos. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 505–520. Springer.

- For **TVSum**:
  > Song, Y., Vallmitjana, J., Stent, A., & Jaimes, A. (2015). Tvsum: Summarizing web videos using titles. In Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 5179–5187.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the findings presented in the paper.
