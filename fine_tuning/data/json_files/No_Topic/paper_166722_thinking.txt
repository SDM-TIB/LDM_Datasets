To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Organic Reaction Outcomes with Weisfeiler-Lehman Network" by Wengong Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial information about any datasets referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on datasets derived from the USPTO, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention using reactions from USPTO granted patents, specifically noting that they obtained a set of 480K reactions after cleaning the data. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also refer to a subset of this dataset, labeled **USPTO-15K**, which consists of 15K reactions selected for comparison purposes. They provide details about how this subset was created, indicating that it includes reactions covered by the 1.7K most common templates.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **USPTO Dataset**: 
   > Lowe, D. M. (2014). Patent reaction extraction: downloads; https://bitbucket.org/dan2097/patent-reaction-extraction/downloads.

2. **USPTO-15K Dataset**: 
   > Coley, C. W., Barzilay, R., Jaakkola, T. S., Green, W. H., & Jensen, K. F. (2017). Prediction of organic reaction outcomes using machine learning. *ACS Central Science*, 3(1), 82-92. doi:10.1021/acscentsci.6b00339.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
