To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flow to Control: Offline Reinforcement Learning with Lossless Primitive Discovery" by Yiqin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are evaluated on the **D4RL benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark is a dataset of interest. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in the **Experiments** section, where they mention evaluating their method on various tasks, specifically stating that they use the **D4RL** tasks, which include environments like **Franka kitchen**, **Antmaze**, and **Adroit**.

I will now gather specific details about the datasets used:

1. **D4RL Benchmark**: This benchmark is explicitly mentioned as the dataset used for evaluation. It includes various tasks that are relevant for offline reinforcement learning.

In the **References section**, I will look for the original source of the D4RL benchmark to provide a full citation. The relevant citation is:

- For **D4RL**:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219*.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Identifying specific datasets in the experiments section.
3. Retrieving full citations from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
