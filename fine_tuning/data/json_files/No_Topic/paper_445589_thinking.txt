To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterexamples to 'Transitive Regret'" by Yuan Chang and Shuo Li Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract primarily discusses theoretical concepts and does not mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might discuss empirical work or examples that could involve datasets. However, upon reviewing the text, it appears that the paper is primarily theoretical and does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Since there are no datasets described in the main sections of the paper, I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The only reference provided is:

- Bikhchandani, Sushil and Uzi Segal (2011). “Transitive regret”. In: Theoretical Economics 6.1, pp. 95–108.

This reference does not indicate a dataset but rather a theoretical framework. Therefore, I conclude that this paper does not contain any datasets that need to be extracted.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that there are no datasets mentioned or used in this research. Consequently, there are no dataset entries to compile or cite. My final step will be to document this finding clearly, noting that the paper is theoretical in nature and does not include empirical datasets.
