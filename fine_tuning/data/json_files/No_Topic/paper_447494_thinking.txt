To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PUTNAMBENCH: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition" by George Tsoukalas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions PUTNAMBENCH as a new multilingual benchmark consisting of 1697 formalizations of 640 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. This indicates that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, the **section 3 (PUTNAMBENCH)** provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including its structure and contents. It states that PUTNAMBENCH includes 1697 formalizations of problems from the Putnam competition, with formalizations in Lean 4, Isabelle, and Coq. This section also highlights the diversity of mathematical topics covered, such as algebra, analysis, and number theory.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. The paper mentions that the problems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle, and a substantial fraction also has formalizations in Coq. However, it does not provide separate citations for these formalizations since they are part of the dataset itself.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **PUTNAMBENCH**: This dataset consists of 1697 formalizations of 640 problems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. The formalizations are available in three languages: Lean 4, Isabelle, and Coq. The dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of neural theorem-provers on competition-level mathematics problems.

Since the dataset is a unique creation of the authors and does not have a separate citation, I will note the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> George Tsoukalas, Jasper Lee, John Jennings, Jimmy Xin, Michelle Ding, Michael Jennings, Amitayush Thakur, Swarat Chaudhuri. *PUTNAMBENCH: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition*. [Preprint]. Under review.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for PUTNAMBENCH, ensuring that the citation is included as required.
