To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Do Classifiers Induce Agents to Invest Effort Strategically?" by Jon Kleinberg and Manish Raghavan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section usually contains comprehensive information about each dataset, including its purpose, size, and how it was used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is from a specific paper, I will ensure to include that paper's citation in my documentation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear format, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are correctly formatted according to academic standards.
