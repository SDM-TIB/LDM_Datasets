To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Maximum Mutual Information Regularized Classification" by Jim Jing-Yan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. The paper mentions two experiments: one on zinc-binding site prediction and another on HEp-2 cell image classification.

1. **Zinc-binding Site Dataset**: The authors describe a dataset consisting of 1,937 zinc-binding CHEDs and 11,049 non-zinc-binding CHEDs, totaling 13,986 samples. This dataset is crucial for the first experiment.

2. **HEp-2 Cell Image Dataset**: For the second experiment, the authors utilize a dataset from the ICIP 2014 competition, which includes 13,596 cell images belonging to six classes. This dataset is essential for evaluating the proposed classification method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Zinc-binding Site Dataset**, the authors reference a paper that discusses the prediction of zinc-binding sites:
  > Z. Chen, Y. Wang, Y.-F. Zhai, J. Song, Z. Zhang, Zincexplorer: An accurate hybrid method to improve the prediction of zinc-binding sites from protein sequences, Molecular BioSystems 9 (9) (2013) 2213–2222.

- For the **HEp-2 Cell Image Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Agrawal, M. Vatsa, R. Singh, Hep-2 cell image classification: A comparative analysis, in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), Vol. 8184 LNCS, 2013, pp. 195 – 202.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Zinc-binding Site Dataset**: Contains 1,937 zinc-binding CHEDs and 11,049 non-zinc-binding CHEDs, totaling 13,986 samples.
   - Citation: Z. Chen, Y. Wang, Y.-F. Zhai, J. Song, Z. Zhang, Zincexplorer: An accurate hybrid method to improve the prediction of zinc-binding sites from protein sequences, Molecular BioSystems 9 (9) (2013) 2213–2222.

2. **HEp-2 Cell Image Dataset**: Comprises 13,596 cell images belonging to six classes.
   - Citation: P. Agrawal, M. Vatsa, R. Singh, Hep-2 cell image classification: A comparative analysis, in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics), Vol. 8184 LNCS, 2013, pp. 195 – 202.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
