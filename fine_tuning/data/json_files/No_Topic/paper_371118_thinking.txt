To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Multi-Behavior Sequence Modeling for Next Item Recommendation" by Junsu Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors release a new, large, and up-to-date dataset for multi-behavior recommendation, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of multi-behavior sequences in recommender systems. They mention that they will release a new dataset, GS Retail, which is collected from a real-world e-commerce service in South Korea. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's relevance.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets: **GS Retail**, **Taobao**, and **Tmall**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **GS Retail**: This dataset is newly released and contains user behavior data from GS SHOP, including three types of user behaviors: Purchase, Add-to-cart, and Click. It is noted for being larger and more up-to-date than existing public datasets.

2. **Taobao**: This dataset includes user interactions over a period of 9 days in 2017, with statistics provided for users, items, and various types of interactions.

3. **Tmall**: This dataset spans 186 days and includes user interactions, with similar statistics as Taobao.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets like GS Retail, Taobao, and Tmall, as they are likely proprietary or internal datasets. Instead, I will note that GS Retail is a new dataset released by the authors, while Taobao and Tmall are publicly available datasets referenced in the context of their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the context and significance of each dataset as described in the paper. The full citations for the datasets will be noted as follows:

- **GS Retail**: 
  > Cho, J., Hyun, D., Lim, D., Cheon, H., Park, H., & Yu, H. (2023). Dynamic Multi-Behavior Sequence Modeling for Next Item Recommendation. *In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence*.

- **Taobao**: 
  > Taobao Dataset. (2017). Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649.

- **Tmall**: 
  > Tmall Dataset. (2014). Retrieved from https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=47.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately captured and cited, ready for further processing or review.
