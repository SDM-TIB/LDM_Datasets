To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multivariate mixture model for myocardial segmentation combining multi-source images" by Xiahai Zhuang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. Here, the author mentions that the CMR data was collected from 35 patients who underwent cardiomyopathy at Shanghai Renji hospital. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

In this section, the author provides details about the CMR data, including the different sequences used (LGE, T2, and bSSFP) and their respective characteristics. I will note down the specifics of this dataset, including the number of patients, the imaging modalities, and any relevant parameters such as resolution and slice thickness.

I will also look for any **references to other datasets** or studies that may have been used for comparison or validation purposes. The references section at the end of the paper will be crucial for retrieving full citations for any datasets mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **CMR Dataset**: This dataset consists of cardiac magnetic resonance images from 35 patients. The details include:
   - Imaging modalities: LGE, T2, and bSSFP.
   - Resolution: LGE images at 0.75 × 0.75 mm, T2 images at 1.35 × 1.35 mm, and bSSFP images at 1.25 × 1.25 mm.
   - Slice thickness: Varies across sequences (5 mm for LGE, 12-20 mm for T2, and 8-13 mm for bSSFP).

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The author may have cited previous works that describe the datasets or methodologies used in the study.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that I have the complete citations for the datasets, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation for future reference.
