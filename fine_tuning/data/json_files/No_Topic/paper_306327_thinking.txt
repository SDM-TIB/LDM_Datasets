To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GiT: Graph Interactive Transformer for Vehicle Re-identification" by Fei Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that "extensive experiments on three large-scale vehicle re-identification datasets demonstrate that our GiT method is superior to state-of-the-art vehicle re-identification approaches." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **VeRi776**: The authors describe it as being captured by 20 cameras in unconstrained traffic scenarios, with a training subset of 37,746 images and a testing subset of 1,678 images. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **VehicleID**: This dataset includes 221,763 images of 26,267 subjects, with specific training and testing subsets outlined. The details about the number of images and subjects are important for understanding the dataset's scale.

3. **VeRi-Wild**: This dataset is noted for containing images captured at both day and night, with a total of 416,314 images across 40,671 subjects. The authors provide a breakdown of the training and testing subsets, which is essential for evaluating their method.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **VeRi776**:
  > Liu, W., Liu, Y., Mei, T., & Ma, H. (2016). A deep learning-based approach to progressive vehicle re-identification for urban surveillance. In European Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 869–884).

- For **VehicleID**:
  > Liu, H., Tian, Y., Wang, Y., Pang, L., & Huang, T. (2016). Deep relative distance learning: Tell the difference between similar vehicles. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 2167–2175).

- For **VeRi-Wild**:
  > Lou, Y., Bai, Y., Liu, J., Wang, S., & Duan, L.-Y. (2019). Veri-wild: A large dataset and a new method for vehicle re-identification in the wild. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 3235–3243).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations for future reference.
