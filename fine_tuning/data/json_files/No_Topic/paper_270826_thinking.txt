To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy Approximate Projection for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting with Partial Volumes" by Roberto Duarte et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is validated on the **EUROSPIN phantom** and **in vivo datasets**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their validation process, which includes the **EUROSPIN phantom** and **in vivo datasets**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific parameters mentioned.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further insights into the datasets used, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted. They mention the use of the **EUROSPIN phantom** and describe the parameters and conditions under which the experiments were conducted. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **EUROSPIN phantom** is likely to be included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

For the **EUROSPIN phantom**, the citation is:
> R. Duarte, A. Repetti, P. A. GÃ³mez, M. Davies, and Y. Wiaux. "Greedy Approximate Projection for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting with Partial Volumes." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2023.

For the **in vivo datasets**, the authors refer to datasets acquired using specific MRI systems, but they do not provide a specific citation for these datasets. Therefore, I will note that the in vivo datasets are derived from experiments conducted on a GE HDx MRI system, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation as it is not explicitly mentioned in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **EUROSPIN phantom** and note the in vivo datasets without a formal citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper.
