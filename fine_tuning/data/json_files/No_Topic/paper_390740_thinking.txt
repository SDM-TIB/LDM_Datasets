To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Denoising Prior-Based Spectral Estimation for Phaseless Synthetic Aperture Radar" by S. Kazemi, B. Yonel, and B. Yazici, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical simulations sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction may mention datasets used for validation or training, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical simulations section** (section 4), where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention a dataset of images used for training and testing their proposed method. Specifically, they state that the training set consists of 5000 samples, each with ground truth images and corresponding SAR intensity measurements, while the test set contains 50 samples with only intensity measurements.

I will extract the following details about the dataset:

1. **Synthetic SAR Dataset**: This dataset includes 5000 training samples and 50 test samples. Each sample contains a ground truth image vector and corresponding SAR intensity measurements. The dimensions of the area covered by the SAR are specified as 62 m Ã— 62 m, with additional details about the SAR's operational parameters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset appears to be generated by the authors for their specific experiments, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is a synthetic one created for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the details about the dataset and its context within the research. If there are any specific references to prior works that influenced the dataset design, I will include those citations as well.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:

- **Synthetic SAR Dataset**: 5000 training samples and 50 test samples, with ground truth images and SAR intensity measurements.

Since this dataset is not publicly available and is created for the study, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset without a formal citation. If any references to similar datasets or methodologies are found in the references, I will include those citations to provide context.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
