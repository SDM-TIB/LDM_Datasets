To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transmission Investment Coordination using MILP" by Sambuddha Chakrabarti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study. I will look for any references to datasets or data sources that the authors may have used in their simulations or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention a **two-region system** and provide specific parameters related to the system, such as generator ranges, costs, and loads. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or repositories. Instead, they describe the parameters used in their simulations, which are derived from theoretical models rather than empirical datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the data used in the simulations is based on the authors' own modeling rather than sourced from existing datasets. This is important to clarify in the documentation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works provide datasets or if they reference any foundational datasets that might be relevant to the study. However, it appears that the references primarily consist of literature on optimization methods and power systems rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not utilize any external datasets but instead relies on modeled parameters for its simulations. I will also ensure to include the full citation for the paper itself:

- Chakrabarti, S., Khajeh, H., Nudell, T. R., Hesamzadeh, M. R., & Baldick, R. (2023). Transmission Investment Coordination using MILP. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for any datasets while also providing proper citations for the work discussed.
