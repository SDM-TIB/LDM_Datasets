To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Review of Skeleton-based Movement Assessment Methods" by Tal Hakim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to locate any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the **Movement Assessment** section, where the author discusses various methods and datasets used in the field.

In **section 2.2 (Public Datasets)**, the author lists several datasets used in the reviewed works. I will carefully note each dataset mentioned, along with the specific movement types they are associated with. The datasets listed include:

1. **SPHERE-staircase 2014,2015**: This dataset is used for assessing gait on stairs.
2. **DGD: DAI gait dataset**: This dataset is focused on gait analysis.
3. **Walking gait dataset**: This dataset includes gait data under nine different conditions.
4. **UPCV Gait K2**: This dataset is for normal walking gait.
5. **Eyes. Mocap data**: This dataset contains motion capture data for various movements.
6. **HMRA**: This dataset is used for physical therapy assessments.
7. **UI-PRMD**: This dataset is also related to physical therapy assessments.
8. **MIT Olympic Scoring Dataset**: This dataset is used for Olympic scoring based on RGB videos.
9. **UNLV Olympic Scoring Dataset**: Similar to the MIT dataset, this one is also for Olympic scoring.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail.

For example, I will find the citation for the **SPHERE-staircase dataset** and others as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
