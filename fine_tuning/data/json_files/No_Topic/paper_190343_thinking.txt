To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HEp-2 Cell Image Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Zhimin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Introduction of the HEp-2 Cell Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe two datasets used in their experiments:

1. **ICPR2014 Cell Dataset**: This dataset contains 13,596 training cell images extracted from 83 specimen images. The images are categorized into six staining patterns: Homogeneous, Speckled, Nucleolar, Centromere, Nuclear Membrane, and Golgi.

2. **ICPR2012 Cell Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,455 cell images from 28 specimens, with images belonging to six classes: Homogeneous, Coarse Speckled, Nucleolar, Centromere, Fine Speckled, and Cytoplasmic.

The authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets, including the number of images and the types of staining patterns, which confirms their relevance for the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ICPR2014 Cell Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lovell, B.C., Percannella, G., Vento, M., Wiliem, A. (2014). Performance evaluation of indirect immunofluorescence image analysis systems. In Proceedings of the ICPR 2014.

- For the **ICPR2012 Cell Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Foggia, P., Percannella, G., Saggese, A., Vento, M. (2013). Benchmarking HEp-2 cells classification methods. Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, 32, 1878â€“1889.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
