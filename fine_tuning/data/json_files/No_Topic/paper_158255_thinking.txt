To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOPF: Higher Order Propagation Framework for Deep Collective Classification" by Priyesh Vijayan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and it mentions that the authors conducted an extensive evaluation across **11 datasets from different domains**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they provide a list of datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Facebook (FB)**: A social network dataset where nodes represent users and the task is to predict political views based on user attributes.
2. **BlogCatalog (BLOG)**: A dataset of users from a social blog directory, where the task is to predict user interests based on blog tags.
3. **Reddit**: A dataset where nodes are Reddit posts, and the task is to predict the sub-Reddit community based on text content.
4. **Cora**: A citation network dataset where articles are nodes, and the task is to predict research areas based on bag-of-words representations.
5. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset similar to Cora, with articles as nodes and citation edges.
6. **Cora2**: A multi-label classification dataset derived from Cora.
7. **Pubmed**: A citation network dataset for biomedical literature.
8. **Yeast**: A protein-protein interaction network dataset for predicting gene functions.
9. **Human**: Another protein-protein interaction dataset from human tissues.
10. **Amazon**: A co-purchase network dataset for DVDs, predicting sales ranks.
11. **Movie**: A dataset constructed from the MovieLens dataset, predicting movie genres.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
