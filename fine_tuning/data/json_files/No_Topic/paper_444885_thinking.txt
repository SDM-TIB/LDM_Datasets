To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast, Scalable, Energy-Efficient Non-element-wise Matrix Multiplication on FPGA" by Xuqi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a matrix multiplication unit but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for testing or validation of the proposed methods. If the authors conducted experiments, they likely used specific datasets, which should be detailed in this section.

In the **results or evaluation section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the performance of the proposed method on various datasets. This could provide insights into the datasets used and their characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain the names and descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will note down the names, sizes, and any relevant details about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the following citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper mentions another dataset, such as **CIFAR-10**, I would find its citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
