To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Children Texts Hold The Key To Commonsense Knowledge?" by Julien Romero and Simon Razniewski, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the paper explores whether children's texts can enhance commonsense knowledge (CSK) compilation, which suggests that specific datasets related to children's texts might be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Children Text Corpora)**, as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Children Book Test (CBT)**: This dataset consists of 108 children's books, targeting readers aged 12-14 years, and is sourced from the Gutenberg Project. The total size is approximately 30 MB.

2. **C4-easy**: This dataset is derived from the C4 corpus, which is a cleaned version of Common Crawl's web crawl corpus. The authors filtered this dataset to include documents with a Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score greater than 80, resulting in 40,827,011 documents, which is about 11% of the original C4 corpus.

3. **InfantBooks**: This newly introduced dataset comprises 496 books aimed at children aged 1-6 years, collected from various websites. The final dataset contains about 2 MB of text.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Children Book Test (CBT)**, the citation is:
  > Hill, F., Bordes, A., Chopra, S., & Weston, J. (2016). The goldilocks principle: Reading childrenâ€™s books with explicit memory representations. In ICLR.

- For **C4**, the citation is:
  > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Li, W., & Liu, P. J. (2020). Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 21, 1-67.

- For **InfantBooks**, since it is a newly introduced dataset, the citation is:
  > Romero, J., & Razniewski, S. (2023). InfantBooks dataset. Available at: https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/children-texts-for-commonsense.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
