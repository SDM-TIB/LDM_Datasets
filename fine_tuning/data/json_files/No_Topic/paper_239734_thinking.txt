To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Removing Dynamic Objects for Static Scene Reconstruction using Light Fields" by Pushyami Kaveti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of light fields and mentions real-world data acquired using a robot with a camera array, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their system setup and the datasets used for testing their method. They mention testing their approach on various datasets collected both indoors and outdoors, specifically noting that all datasets consist of images of 720x540 pixels. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets in this section.

To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **acknowledgment and references sections** for any citations or mentions of datasets that may not have been detailed in the main text. The references may provide insights into the datasets used or similar datasets that could be relevant.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about the datasets. Since the authors do not provide specific names for the datasets, I will note that they used custom datasets collected with a light field array, but I will also highlight the lack of specific dataset citations.

Finally, I will ensure to document any relevant citations from the references that may pertain to the methodologies or datasets discussed in the paper, even if they do not directly name a dataset.

In summary, I will extract the following information:
1. A description of the datasets used (noting that they are custom datasets collected with a light field array).
2. Any relevant citations from the references that could provide context or additional information about similar datasets.

This will allow me to create a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if specific dataset names are not provided.
