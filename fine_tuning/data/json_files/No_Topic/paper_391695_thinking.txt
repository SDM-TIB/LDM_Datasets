To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Surgery for One-shot Unlearning on Generative Model" by Seohui Bae et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the concept of unlearning in generative models but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a subset of **MNIST** and **CelebA** datasets for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used for their evaluations.

In **Section 3.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors specify that they use a subset of **MNIST** with samples of classes 1, 3, and 8, and **CelebA** for training and unlearning a vanilla Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730â€“3738, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
- **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
