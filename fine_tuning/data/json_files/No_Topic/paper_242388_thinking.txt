To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Image Wasserstein Attacks and Defenses" by J. Edward Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** or any section explicitly labeled as **Datasets**. In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research.
