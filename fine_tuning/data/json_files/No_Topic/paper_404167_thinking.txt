To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Calibration for In-context Learning" by Zhongtao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on **12 text classification tasks**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **SST2**: A sentiment analysis dataset consisting of movie reviews, where the task is to classify the sentiment as positive or negative.
2. **SST5**: An extension of SST2 that includes five sentiment categories.
3. **CR (Customer Reviews)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis based on customer reviews.
4. **MR (Movie Reviews)**: Another sentiment analysis dataset based on movie reviews.
5. **SUBJ (Subjectivity)**: A dataset that includes subjective and objective sentences.
6. **AGNews**: A news categorization dataset with four categories.
7. **DBPedia**: A dataset for entity classification from Wikipedia.
8. **TREC**: A dataset for question classification.
9. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for entailment tasks.
10. **CB (CommitmentBank)**: A dataset for investigating projection in discourse.
11. **SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for natural language inference tasks.
12. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for identifying duplicate questions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
