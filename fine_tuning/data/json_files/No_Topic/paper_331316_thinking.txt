To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker Adaptation Using Spectro-Temporal Deep Features for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition" by Mengzhe Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on four tasks involving specific speech corpora, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **UASpeech Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest publicly available dysarthric speech database, containing approximately 103 hours of speech recorded from 29 speakers (16 dysarthric and 13 control healthy speakers).

2. **TORGO Dataset**: This dataset consists of dysarthric speech data from 15 speakers (8 dysarthric and 7 control healthy speakers) with a total of approximately 13.5 hours of audio.

3. **DementiaBank Pitt Dataset**: This dataset contains around 33 hours of audio data recorded from interviews between elderly participants and clinical investigators, split into training, development, and evaluation sets.

4. **Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA Dataset**: This dataset includes conversations recorded from cognitive impairment assessment interviews between elderly participants and clinical investigators, totaling approximately 32.4 hours of speech.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **UASpeech Dataset**:
  > Kim, H., et al. "Dysarthric speech database for universal access research." In INTERSPEECH, 2008.

- For **TORGO Dataset**:
  > Rudzicz, F., et al. "The TORGO database of acoustic and articulatory speech from speakers with dysarthria." Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 46, no. 4, 2012.

- For **Cantonese JCCOCC MoCA Dataset**:
  > Xu, S. S., et al. "Speaker Turn Aware Similarity Scoring for Diarization of Speech-Based Cognitive Assessments." 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
