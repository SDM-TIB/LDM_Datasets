To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improving Multi-label Recognition using Class Co-Occurrence Probabilities" by Samyak Rawlekar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on four MLR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **MS-COCO 2014-small**: This dataset consists of a small subset (5%) of the larger MS-COCO dataset, containing 4,014 images. The full dataset has 82,081 training images and 40,504 validation images across 80 classes.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: This dataset includes 9,963 images from 20 classes and is a widely used benchmark for multi-label recognition.

3. **FoodSeg103**: This dataset is specifically for food segmentation and multi-label food recognition, containing 4,983 training images and 2,135 test images, with a total of 32,097 food instances across 103 classes.

4. **UNIMIB 2016**: This dataset consists of 1,027 images with 3,616 food instances spanning 73 classes, also following a long-tail distribution typical of real-world datasets.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:

- For **FoodSeg103**, the citation is:
  > Wu, X., Fu, X., Liu, Y., Lim, E.P., Hoi, S.C., Sun, Q. (2021). *A large-scale benchmark for food image segmentation*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia. pp. 506–515.

- For **UNIMIB 2016**, the citation is:
  > Ciocca, G., Napoletano, P., Schettini, R. (2016). *Food recognition: a new dataset, experiments, and results*. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, 21(3), 588–598.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
