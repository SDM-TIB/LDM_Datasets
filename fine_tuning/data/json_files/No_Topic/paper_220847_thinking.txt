To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "From Data Quality to Model Quality: an Exploratory Study on Deep Learning" by Tianxing He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**, which suggests these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section III) to confirm the use of these datasets and gather more details about how they were utilized. The authors mention using **MNIST** to train the Lenet-5 model and **CIFAR-10** to train ResNet-20 and NetworkInNetwork models. This confirms that both datasets are central to their experiments.

I will also look for any additional context or specific details about the datasets in the **data quality aspects** section (Section II) and the **experimental results** section. However, since the datasets are already well-known, the focus will primarily be on their application in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **MNIST**, the citation is:
   > Y. LeCun, “The mnist database of handwritten digits,” http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Citeseer, Tech. Rep., 2009.

With this information in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST**: A widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of digits from 0 to 9.
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class, commonly used for image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
