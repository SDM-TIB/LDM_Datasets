To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-informed neural networks for the shallow-water equations on the sphere" by Alex Bihlo and Roman O. Popovych, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In this paper, the authors reference the use of a "standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow-water equations on the sphere" proposed by Williamson et al. This indicates that there is a dataset or benchmark involved.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper cites the following:

- For the standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow-water equations, the citation is:
  > Williamson, D.L., Drake, J.B., Hack, J.J., Rüdiger, J., & Swarztrauber, P.N. (1992). *A standard test set for numerical approximations to the shallow water equations in spherical geometry*. Journal of Computational Physics, 102, 211–224.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have all necessary details about the dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper referencing. This will allow for easy access and verification of the dataset used in the research.
