To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regression Discontinuity Designs" by Matias D. Cattaneo and RocÃ­o Titiunik, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss empirical applications** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on regression discontinuity designs but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **introduction**.

In the introduction, the authors discuss various applications of regression discontinuity designs in different fields, such as economics and public policy, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology and empirical sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on sections that detail examples or applications of regression discontinuity designs.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Designs and Parameters)** and **section 4 (Validation and Falsification)**, as these sections may contain references to specific datasets used in empirical studies. I will look for any case studies or examples that illustrate the application of regression discontinuity designs, as these often include references to datasets.

Upon reviewing these sections, I find that the authors reference several empirical applications, including:

1. **Head Start Program**: The authors mention Ludwig and Miller (2007) as a study that uses regression discontinuity to analyze the effects of the Head Start program on child mortality. This indicates the use of a dataset related to child mortality and Head Start program participation.

2. **Social Services Program**: They also reference a study by Ludwig and Miller (2007) that examines the effects of expanding the Head Start program on child mortality, which implies the use of datasets related to social services and child health outcomes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Head Start Program** dataset, the citation is:
  > Ludwig, J., & Miller, D. L. (2007). Does Head Start Improve Children's Life Chances? Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity Design. *Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 122(1), 159-208.

- For the **social services program** dataset, the same citation applies as it pertains to the same study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, I have identified the datasets related to the Head Start program and social services, and I have retrieved their full citations. I will now prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements.
