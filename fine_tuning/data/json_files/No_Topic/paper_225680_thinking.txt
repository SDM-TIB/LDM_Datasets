To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Orthogonal Regression: Two non-Linear Regressions for Causal Inference" by M. Reza Heydari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods proposed, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **Cause-effect (version 1.0) pairs** dataset, which consists of 108 real-world datasets. They specify that they considered 94 of these datasets for their experiments, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the dataset as "Cause-effect (version 1.0) pairs" and cite the work by Mooij et al. (2016) as the source of this dataset.

The citation for the **Cause-effect (version 1.0) pairs** dataset is:
> Mooij, J. M., Peters, J., Janzing, D., Zscheischler, J., and Sch√∂lkopf, B. (2016). Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data: methods and benchmarks. *The Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 17(1), 1103-1204.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Cause-effect (version 1.0) pairs** dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or documentation.
