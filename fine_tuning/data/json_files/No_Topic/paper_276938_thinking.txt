To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Computer Vision Based Beamforming Scheme for Millimeter Wave Communication in LOS Scenarios" by Tianqi Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses a novel beamforming scheme that utilizes computer vision, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In the **simulation results section**, the authors refer to using a video from a specific source for their experiments, which is crucial for dataset identification.

Upon reviewing the **references**, I find that the paper mentions a specific dataset used for object tracking:

1. **Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the YOLOv3 network for object detection. The authors state that they used this benchmark to assess their method's effectiveness.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the **Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark** from the references section:

- For the **Multiple Object Tracking Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Multiple object tracking benchmark, [online] Available: http://motchallenge.net

Since this is an online resource, I will ensure to note that it is a benchmark dataset available for public use.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
