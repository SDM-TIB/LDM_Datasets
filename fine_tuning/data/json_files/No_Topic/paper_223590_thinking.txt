To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Unified Attention Networks for Vision-and-Language Interactions" by Zhou Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their models on **two VQA datasets and three visual grounding datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **VQA-v2**: This is a benchmark dataset for open-ended visual question answering. It contains human-annotated question-answer pairs for MS-COCO images. The dataset is split into three subsets: train (80k images with 444k questions), val (40k images with 214k questions), and test (80k images with 448k questions).

2. **CLEVR**: A synthesized dataset containing 100k images and 853k questions, designed to test various aspects of visual reasoning. It is split into three subsets: train (70k images with 700k questions), val (15k images with 150k questions), and test (15k images with 15k questions).

3. **RefCOCO**: A dataset for visual grounding that contains queries collected from MS-COCO images. It is split into subsets: train (120k queries), val (11k queries), testA (6k queries about people), and testB (5k queries about objects).

4. **RefCOCO+**: Similar to RefCOCO but with short queries. It also has train, val, testA, and testB splits.

5. **RefCOCOg**: Another visual grounding dataset with longer queries, split into train (81k queries), val (5k queries), and test (10k queries).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RefCOCOg**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
