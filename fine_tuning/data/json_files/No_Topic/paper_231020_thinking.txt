To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Copy-Move Forgery Classification via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Akash Kumar and Arnav Bhavsar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, approach, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors created a synthetic forged dataset using a deep semantic image inpainting algorithm, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the insufficiency of publicly available datasets for image forgery detection. They also state that they generated a new dataset of forged images using the COCO dataset. This is a crucial point that indicates the creation of a new dataset.

In the **approach section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They synthesized a dataset of copy-move forged images using the COCO dataset, specifying that they used all sub-categories of COCO to create approximately 15,000 images. This is an important dataset to note.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their architecture on the **CASIA V2 dataset** in the approach section. They describe this dataset as containing 4,975 images, with a breakdown of authentic and forged images. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S. J., Bourdev, L. D., Girshick, R. B., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV.

2. For the **CASIA V2 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Dong, J., Wang, W., and Tan, T. (2013). *CASIA Image Tampering Detection Evaluation Database*. In 2013 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing, 422–426.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create entries for each dataset according to the specified format, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
