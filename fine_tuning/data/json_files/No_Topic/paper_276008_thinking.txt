To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Baseline Subtraction for Increased Sensitivity of Quantitative PCR Measurements" by Paul N. Patrone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on improving qPCR measurements, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using **Extraction Blanks (EBs)** and **Non-Template Controls (NTCs)** as part of their methodology. I will note these as they are crucial for understanding the datasets involved in their analysis.

In the **results section**, the authors detail their experimental design, including the use of **Human DNA Quantitation Standard (Standard Reference Material 2372a)**. They describe how they prepared dilutions of this standard for their experiments, which indicates that this is a dataset used for their analysis.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Human DNA Quantitation Standard (Standard Reference Material 2372a)**:
   > E. Romsos, M. Kline, D. Duewer, B. Toman, and N. Farkas. *Certification of Standard Reference Material 2372a Human DNA Quantitation Standard*. National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 260-189, 2018.

2. **Extraction Blanks (EBs)** and **Non-Template Controls (NTCs)** are not formal datasets with citations but rather experimental controls used in the study. However, I will note their significance in the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or analysis.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that the citations are complete and formatted correctly.
