To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximately Equivariant Quantum Neural Network for p4m Group Symmetries in Images" by Su Yeon Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors present results tested in different use cases, including "phase detection of the 2D Ising model" and "classification of the extended MNIST dataset." This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Results)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **Ising Model Dataset**: This dataset consists of the spin distribution of a 2D lattice Ising model with 16 × 16 interacting spins, simulated using Metropolis Monte Carlo. The authors describe its properties, including its reflectional and rotational symmetry by construction.

2. **Extended MNIST Dataset**: This dataset includes randomly reflected and rotated handwritten digit images, specifically for the classification of digits 4 and 5, downsampled into 16 × 16 pixels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The Ising model is a well-known dataset in statistical physics, but I will still look for a specific citation if the authors reference a particular study or dataset version. The extended MNIST dataset is also a common dataset, and I will confirm if the authors provide a specific citation for it.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the full citations:

- For the **Ising Model Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lars Onsager. *Crystal statistics. I. A two-dimensional model with an order-disorder transition*. Phys. Rev., 65:117–149, Feb 1944.

- For the **Extended MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
