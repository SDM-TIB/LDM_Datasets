To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Technology Readiness Levels for Machine Learning Systems" by Alexander Lavin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it can indicate the types of applications or domains the authors are discussing.

Next, I will focus on the **methods and examples sections**, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **examples section**, the authors discuss various applications of their framework, such as human-machine visual inspection and computer vision for automated recycling. I will pay close attention to any datasets mentioned in these contexts. For instance, they might refer to specific datasets used for training or testing their models.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "CAMS (Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance) project," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Jenniskens, P., Gural, P. S., Dynneson, L., et al. "CAMS: Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance to Establish Minor Meteor Showers." *Icarus*, 216(1): 40-61, 2011.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the specified requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset identified in the paper.
