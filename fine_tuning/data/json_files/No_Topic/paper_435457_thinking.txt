To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Outlier-robust Kalman Filtering through Generalised Bayes" by Gerardo Duran-Martin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, and it may mention datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or features.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in Section 4.2 (Robust EKF for online MLP regression) and Section 4.3 (Robust EnKF for Lorenz96 model). I will extract the following datasets:

1. **UCI Datasets**: The authors mention using several UCI datasets for their experiments. They provide a table (Table 3) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of examples, features, and parameters.

2. **Lorenz96 Model**: The authors describe a modified version of the Lorenz96 model used for their experiments. While this is not a traditional dataset, it is a simulation model that generates data for testing their methods.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the UCI datasets, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets. For the Lorenz96 model, I will check if the authors reference any foundational papers or sources that describe the model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset, including its name, description, and citation.
