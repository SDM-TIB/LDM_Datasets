To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepGEMM: Accelerated Ultra Low-Precision Inference on CPU Architectures using Lookup Tables" by Darshan C. Ganji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look deeper for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for benchmarking or evaluation. If the authors discuss comparisons with existing methods, they may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** for any detailed descriptions of datasets used in experiments. This section often contains information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

I will also check the **experimental results section** for any tables or figures that summarize the performance of the proposed method on specific datasets. This can provide insights into which datasets were used for evaluation and their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

If the paper discusses other datasets, such as **CIFAR-10** or **COCO**, I will ensure to find their respective citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
