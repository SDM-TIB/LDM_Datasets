To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Habitat-Web: Learning Embodied Object-Search Strategies from Human Demonstrations at Scale" by Ram Ramrakhya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **80k demonstrations for OBJECTNAV** and **12k demonstrations for PICK&PLACE**, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Tasks and Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **OBJECTNAV Human Demonstrations (OBJECTNAV-HD)**: This dataset consists of **80k demonstrations** collected from the Matterport3D simulator, with a breakdown of **70k demonstrations** from 56 training scenes and **10k demonstrations** from 25 training scenes in the Gibson dataset.

2. **Shortest Path Demonstrations for OBJECTNAV**: This dataset is generated by creating shortest paths to the nearest navigable goal object viewpoint, totaling **35k demonstrations**.

3. **PICK&PLACE Human Demonstrations (PICK&PLACE-HD)**: This dataset includes **âˆ¼12k demonstrations** collected across 9 scenes from Matterport3D, with each demonstration corresponding to unique object-receptacle pairs.

4. **Shortest Path Demonstrations for PICK&PLACE**: Similar to OBJECTNAV, this dataset consists of **25.7k shortest path demonstrations** generated to match the cumulative steps of experience with human demonstrations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For **Matterport3D**:
  > Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. In 3DV.

- For **Gibson**:
  > Xia, F., Zamir, A. R., He, Z., Sax, A., Malik, J., & Savarese, S. (2018). *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In CVPR.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
