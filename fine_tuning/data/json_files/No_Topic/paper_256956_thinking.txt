To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Ranking-based, Balanced Loss Function Unifying Classification and Localisation in Object Detection" by Kemal Oksuz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **COCO dataset**, which is a significant indication that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to gather more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they train their models on the **COCO trainval35K set** (which consists of 115K images) and test on the **COCO minival set** (5K images). They also mention comparing their results with the state-of-the-art on the **COCO test-dev set** (20K images). This confirms the use of the COCO dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin T, Maire M, Belongie S, Hays J, Perona P, Ramanan D, Doll√°r P, Zitnick CL. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In: The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **COCO trainval35K set**: A dataset consisting of 115K images used for training.
2. **COCO minival set**: A dataset consisting of 5K images used for validation.
3. **COCO test-dev set**: A dataset consisting of 20K images used for testing.

Now, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset ready for documentation. 

In summary, I have successfully extracted the datasets from the paper and noted their full citations, which are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
