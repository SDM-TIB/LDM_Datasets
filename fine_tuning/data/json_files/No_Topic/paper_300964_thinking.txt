To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncovering Constraint-Based Behavior in Neural Models via Targeted Fine-Tuning" by Forrest Davis and Marten van Schijndel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention constructing two classes of datasets for fine-tuning the models. Specifically, they used:

1. **AnCora Spanish newswire corpus**: This dataset is used to demote the pro-drop constraint in Spanish models.
2. **ISDT (Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank)** and **VIT (Venice Italian Treebank)**: These datasets are used for fine-tuning Italian models to demote the pro-drop constraint.
3. **English Web Treebank**: This dataset is used to inject a pro-drop constraint into English models.
4. **Traditional Chinese Universal Dependencies Treebank (GSD)** and **Chinese Parallel Universal Dependencies (PUD)**: These datasets are used to inject a pro-drop constraint into Chinese models.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure proper documentation and accessibility for future research.
