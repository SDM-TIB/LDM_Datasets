To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation of Cardiac Valve Annuli Motion with Deep Learning" by Eric Kerfoot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of characterizing valve annuli motion and mention the use of clinical scans, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Training Data and Manual Annotation)**, where the authors describe the training dataset. They mention that the training dataset consists of **8574 long-axis images** collected from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and myocardial infarction (MI). This section also specifies the sources of the images, indicating that the MI patients were part of the **DETERMINE study** obtained through the **Cardiac Atlas Project**.

I will note the details of the dataset:
1. **Training Dataset**: 
   - Contains 8574 long-axis images from HCM (3069 images) and MI (5505 images) patients.
   - Images were collected from clinical scans in 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views.
   - The validation set consists of 930 images.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **Cardiac Atlas Project**, which I will need to cite properly. The citation for the Cardiac Atlas Project is:

- **Cardiac Atlas Project**: 
  > Fonseca, C.G., Backhaus, M., Bluemke, D.A., Britten, R.D., Chung, J.D., Cowan, B.R., Dinov, I.D., Finn, J.P., Hunter, P.J., Kadish, A.H., Lee, D.C., Lima, J.A.C., Medrano Gracia, P., Shivkumar, K., Suinesiaputra, A., Tao, W., Young, A.A. "The cardiac atlas project—an imaging database for computational modeling and statistical atlases of the heart." Bioinformatics 27(16), 2288–2295, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
