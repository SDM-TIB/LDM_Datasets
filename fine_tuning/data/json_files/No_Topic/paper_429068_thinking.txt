To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternatives to Classical Option Pricing" by W. Brent Lindquist and Svetlozar T. Rachev, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments or analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss two approaches to option pricing, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for empirical validation or analysis. Instead, they focus on theoretical frameworks and models. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets directly referenced in the paper.

After reviewing the **References section**, I will check for any cited works that may include datasets. However, since the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts without empirical data, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper presents significant theoretical contributions to option pricing, it does not provide specific datasets or empirical data for citation.

In summary, my extraction process reveals that this paper does not include datasets, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
