To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Tolerant Federated Learning" by Pengyuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of federated learning and mentions the use of a mobile broadband dataset provided by the FCC, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Problem Study)**, where the authors describe their analysis of mobile network conditions. Here, they explicitly mention using a dataset from the **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)** to study mobile broadband conditions. This dataset is crucial for understanding the network conditions of users and is likely to be one of the primary datasets referenced in their experiments.

In this section, the authors state: "We use a mobile broadband dataset provided by FCC [Commission, 2020] to study the mobile network conditions of users." This confirms the dataset's relevance and importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FCC dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Federal Communications Commission. Measuring Broadband America Mobile Data, 2020. https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/measuring-broadband-america/measuring-broadband-america-mobile-data.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors also refer to synthetic datasets generated for their experiments, specifically labeled as **Synthetic(i.i.d)**, **Synthetic(0.5,0.5)**, and **Synthetic(1,1)**. However, these synthetic datasets do not have formal citations as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the FCC dataset, while noting that the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations.

In summary, the identified datasets are:
1. **Mobile Broadband Dataset** from the FCC, with the citation provided.
2. **Synthetic(i.i.d)**, **Synthetic(0.5,0.5)**, and **Synthetic(1,1)** datasets, which are generated for the study but do not have formal citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citation for the FCC dataset is accurately included.
