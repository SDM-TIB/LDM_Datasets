To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VECODER - Variational Embeddings for Community Detection and Node Representation" by Rayyan Ahmad Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on several graph datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In **Section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list 18 different datasets, providing details such as the number of nodes, edges, and features for each dataset. This section is crucial as it contains the specific datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

I will carefully note down the names of each dataset along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **CiteSeer**
2. **CiteSeer-full**
3. **Cora**
4. **Cora-ML**
5. **Cora-full**
6. **fb0**
7. **fb107**
8. **fb1684**
9. **fb1912**
10. **fb3437**
11. **fb348**
12. **fb414**
13. **fb698**
14. **youtube**
15. **amazon**
16. **amazon500**
17. **amazon1000**
18. **dblp**

For each dataset, I will also extract the relevant statistics such as the number of nodes (|V|), edges (|E|), and features (|F|) as provided in the table.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors mention that some datasets are taken from specific sources, such as the SNAP repository, and they provide citations for the original papers associated with these datasets. 

For example, the citations for the datasets can be as follows:

- **CiteSeer**: 
  > Bojchevski, A., & GÂ¨unnemann, S. (2017). Deep gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.03815.

  > McCallum, A., & Nigam, S. (2002). A comparison of event models for naive bayes text classification. In AAAI-98 workshop on learning for text categorization (Vol. 752, pp. 41-48).

- **Facebook datasets (fb0, fb107, etc.)**:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their respective sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
