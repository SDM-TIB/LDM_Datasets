To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Cross Batch Normalization for Metric Learning" by Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on three popular image retrieval datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Stanford Online Products (SOP)**: This dataset contains 120,053 online product images across 22,634 categories, with specific splits for training and testing.

2. **In-shop Clothes Retrieval (IN-SHOP)**: This dataset consists of 72,712 clothing images across 7,986 classes, with details on how the training and testing sets are partitioned.

3. **Deep Fashion 2 (DEEPFASHION2)**: This dataset includes 217,778 clothing bounding boxes for consumer-to-shop retrieval, with specific details on the training and testing protocols.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing them with the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Stanford Online Products (SOP)**, the citation is:
  > Hyun Oh Song, Yu Xiang, Stefanie Jegelka, and Silvio Savarese. *Deep metric learning via lifted structured feature embedding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 4004–4012, 2016.

- For **In-shop Clothes Retrieval (IN-SHOP)**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deepfashion: Powering robust clothes recognition and retrieval with rich annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1096–1104, 2016.

- For **Deep Fashion 2 (DEEPFASHION2)**, the citation is:
  > Yuying Ge, Ruimao Zhang, Xiaogang Wang, Xiaoou Tang, and Ping Luo. *Deepfashion2: A versatile benchmark for detection, pose estimation, segmentation and re-identification of clothing images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5337–5345, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
