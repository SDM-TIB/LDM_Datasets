To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can LLMs Solve Longer Math Word Problems Better?" by Xin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **Extended Grade-School Math (E-GSM)** dataset, which is a clear indication that a dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The E-GSM Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe how E-GSM was constructed from the original GSM8K dataset, emphasizing its purpose to evaluate the ability of LLMs to handle longer math word problems. This section will likely contain the most relevant details about the dataset, including its size, structure, and the process of its creation.

In this section, I will note the following key points:
1. **E-GSM Dataset**: This dataset consists of math word problems with extended contexts derived from the GSM8K benchmark. The authors mention that E-GSM includes around 4.5K MWPs and is divided into four rounds of extension.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original GSM8K dataset, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The citation for GSM8K is:
> Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., et al. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GSM8K dataset as well as the details about the E-GSM dataset.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **E-GSM Dataset**: A new dataset created to evaluate LLMs on longer math word problems.
2. **GSM8K Dataset**: The original dataset from which E-GSM was derived.

I will ensure that the citations are complete and formatted correctly for any further processing or documentation.
