To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time EEG Classification via Coresets for BCI Applications" by Eitan Netzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) and mentions the use of EEG signals, which suggests that there may be datasets related to EEG recordings.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss various techniques developed for EEG-MI based BCI systems. They mention the average accuracy of classifying imaginary left and right hand movements, which indicates that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors specify that they used the "Motor Imaginary right/left hands task from the EEG Motor Movement/Imaginary dataset" created and contributed to Physionet. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the EEG Motor Movement/Imaginary dataset is:

- **EEG Motor Movement/Imaginary Dataset**: 
  > Goldberger, A. L., Amaral, L. A. N., Glass, L., Hausdorff, J. M., Ivanov, P. C., Mark, R. G., Mietus, J. E., Moody, G. B., Peng, C.-K., & Stanley, H. E. (2000). Physiobank, physiotoolkit, and physionet. *Circulation*, 101(23), e215â€“e220. doi:10.1161/01.CIR.101.23.e215.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **EEG Motor Movement/Imaginary Dataset**: This dataset includes EEG recordings from 109 participants, with approximately 44 trials for each motor imagery task (left and right hand movements). It was recorded using 64 electrodes in a 10-10 system arrangement with a sampling frequency of 160Hz.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
