To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Periodicity in Cryptocurrency Volatility and Liquidity" by Peter Reinhard Hansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors study recurrent patterns in volatility and volume for major cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin and Ether, using data from three exchanges: **Coinbase Pro**, **Binance**, and **Uniswap V2**. This indicates that these exchanges are likely sources of the datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Preliminary Results)**, where the authors describe the data in detail. They mention that they include data for five markets: **BTC/USD (Coinbase Pro)**, **ETH/USD (Coinbase Pro)**, **BTC/USDT (Binance)**, **ETH/USDT (Binance)**, and **WETH/USDC (Uniswap V2)**. This section provides specific details about the data sources and the time period covered, which is crucial for documenting the datasets.

The authors state that they downloaded 1-minute OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data and trade data for the centralized exchanges through an API, and they collected OHLC prices for Uniswap V2 through a different API. This information is essential for understanding the nature of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the sources of the data. I will note the relevant citations for the exchanges and any related works that describe the datasets:

1. **Coinbase Pro**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for Coinbase Pro, but it is a well-known exchange. I will note it as a source of data.
2. **Binance**: Similar to Coinbase Pro, Binance is a widely recognized exchange, and I will note it as a source of data.
3. **Uniswap V2**: The authors mention using data from Uniswap V2, which is also a well-known decentralized exchange.

Since the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **BTC/USD (Coinbase Pro)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Coinbase Pro.
- **ETH/USD (Coinbase Pro)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Coinbase Pro.
- **BTC/USDT (Binance)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Binance.
- **ETH/USDT (Binance)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Binance.
- **WETH/USDC (Uniswap V2)**: Block-by-block OHLC prices from Uniswap V2.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant information, including the sources of the data, into a structured format for further processing or review. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are as follows:

1. **BTC/USD (Coinbase Pro)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Coinbase Pro.
2. **ETH/USD (Coinbase Pro)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Coinbase Pro.
3. **BTC/USDT (Binance)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Binance.
4. **ETH/USDT (Binance)**: 1-minute OHLCV data from Binance.
5. **WETH/USDC (Uniswap V2)**: Block-by-block OHLC prices from Uniswap V2.

I will ensure to document the sources accurately and prepare the dataset entries for any required output format.
