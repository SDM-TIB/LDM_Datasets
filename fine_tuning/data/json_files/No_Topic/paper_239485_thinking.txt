To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Hypergraph Clustering via Convex Relaxation of Truncated MLE" by Jeonghwan Lee, Daesung Kim, and Hye Won Chung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for any sections specifically dedicated to datasets, such as a **"Datasets" or "Experiments" section**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were collected or processed.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology** and **results** sections for any references to datasets used in experiments or analyses. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their experiments, which can provide valuable information about their nature and usage.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note their names and any relevant details provided in the paper. It is crucial to also check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. This may include original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or commonly used name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including its size, type, and any specific features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will organize it clearly to ensure that each dataset is well-documented with its citation. This will facilitate easy access and verification for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
