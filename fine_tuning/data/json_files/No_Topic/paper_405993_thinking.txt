To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Phylogeny and Taxonomy with Protein-protein Interaction Networks" by Long-Huei Chen, Mohana Prasad Sathya Moorthy, and Pratyaksh Sharma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for analysis.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources. The authors discuss the importance of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and their relationship to phylogeny and taxonomy, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors describe their data collection methods. Here, they mention using the **STRING v10 database**, which includes PPI networks for over 2000 species. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, I will check for any other datasets mentioned in the **results or discussion sections**. The authors may refer to specific analyses or comparisons that rely on particular datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the STRING database, I will look for the original paper or documentation that describes it.

The citation for the STRING database is:
> Szklarczyk, D., Franceschini, A., Wyder, S., et al. "STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life." Nucleic Acids Research, vol. 43, no. D1, pp. D447-D452, 2015.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for each dataset referenced in the paper.
