To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Laplace Approximation" by Yinsong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to focus on sections that explicitly mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical framework and the context of their research, but they do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for testing their proposed methods. They mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their in-distribution experiments, as well as the **Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset** and the **SVHN dataset** for out-of-distribution experiments.

Next, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models.

3. **Kuzushiji-MNIST Dataset**: A dataset similar to MNIST but consists of images of handwritten Japanese characters (Kuzushiji). It contains 10,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

4. **SVHN Dataset**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains over 600,000 digit images obtained from Google Street View. It is used for digit recognition tasks.

Now, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For the **Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Asanobu Kitamoto, Alex Lamb, Kazuaki Yamamoto, and David Ha. *Deep learning for classical Japanese literature*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

- For the **SVHN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Baolin Wu, Andrew Y Ng, et al. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 7. Granada, Spain, 2011.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
