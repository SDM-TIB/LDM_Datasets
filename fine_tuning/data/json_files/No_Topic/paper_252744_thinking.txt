To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MODEL: Motif-based Deep Feature Learning for Link Prediction" by Lei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on six networks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will locate **section V (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention six datasets, which are categorized into three types: social networks, biological networks, and academic networks. The datasets listed are:

1. **Youtube**: A social network dataset with 5,246 vertices and 24,121 edges.
2. **LiveJournal**: Another social network dataset with 2,456 vertices and 188,490 edges.
3. **Bio-sc-cc**: A biological network dataset with 2,236 vertices and 34,879 edges.
4. **Bio-sc-ht**: Another biological network dataset with 2,084 vertices and 63,027 edges.
5. **DBLP**: An academic network dataset with 4,424 vertices and 12,169 edges.
6. **Ca-GrQc**: Another academic network dataset with 4,158 vertices and 13,422 edges.

I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be directly provided for the datasets themselves, but I can look for the original sources or papers that introduced these datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Youtube** and **LiveJournal** datasets can be found in the reference to the original dataset collection by Leskovec et al. Similarly, the citations for the biological datasets can be traced back to their respective original publications.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citation for each dataset is included, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reference.
