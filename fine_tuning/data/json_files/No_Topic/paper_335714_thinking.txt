To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging unsupervised and weakly-supervised data to improve direct speech-to-speech translation" by Ye Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions improvements on the **CVSS-C corpus**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this is where datasets are typically discussed in relation to the experiments conducted. In this section, the authors describe the **CVSS-C corpus** in detail, stating that it contains sentence-level paired S2ST data in 21 language pairs, with specifics about the source and target speech.

I will also check the **Methods** section, particularly the subsections discussing pre-training and data augmentation, as they may reference additional datasets used for training the models. The authors mention using data from **VoxPopuli**, **Common Voice**, **MLS**, and **Babel** for unsupervised speech data, and **mC4** for unsupervised text data.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include full citations for each one as found in the **References section** of the paper.

1. **CVSS-C corpus**: This dataset is derived from the CoVoST 2 and Common Voice corpora, containing 1,153 hours of human read speech and 719 hours of high-quality TTS synthetic speech.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
