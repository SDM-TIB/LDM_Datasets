To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Defining Smart Cities using Transformer Neural Networks" by Andrei Khurshudov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the use of datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the data sources and datasets used in the research. In this paper, the author mentions reviewing **60 definitions of smart cities** from various sources, which suggests that there may be datasets or collections of definitions involved.

I will also check the **appendix** for any supplementary materials that might list the datasets or definitions used in the analysis. The appendix is often a good place to find detailed information that supports the main text.

After identifying any datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset of smart city definitions, I will ensure to note the source of that dataset and provide a complete citation. If the dataset is derived from a specific study or report, I will include that citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
