To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unifying Framework for Testing Shape Restrictions" by Zheng Fang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical application sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the empirical relevance of the framework by investigating the relationship between weekly working hours and annual wage growth, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to labor market statistics.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical application section**, where the author discusses the GMAT sample. This section provides details about the dataset used for analysis. Specifically, it states that the GMAT sample consists of individuals who registered for the GMAT between June 1990 and March 1991, with a final cleaned sample of 1,911 respondents.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper cites Gicheva (2013) for the empirical analysis, which likely contains the original dataset details.

The relevant dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **GMAT Sample Dataset**: This dataset includes individuals who registered for the GMAT between June 1990 and March 1991, focusing on their working hours and wage growth. The final cleaned sample consists of 1,911 respondents.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the GMAT dataset as referenced in the paper. The citation for Gicheva (2013) is as follows:
> Gicheva, D. (2013). *Working long hours and early career outcomes in the high-end labor market*. Journal of Labor Economics, 31, 785â€“824.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified the GMAT sample dataset and its citation, which will be documented accordingly.
