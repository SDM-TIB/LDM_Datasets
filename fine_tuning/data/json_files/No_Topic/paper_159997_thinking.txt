To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are ResNets Provably Better than Linear Predictors?" by Ohad Shamir, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. If there is a section specifically titled "Datasets," it will likely contain detailed information about each dataset.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors. If the authors mention using well-known datasets, I will ensure to note their full names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation that typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for any further processing or review.
