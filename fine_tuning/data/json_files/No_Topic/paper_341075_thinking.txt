To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On state-space representations of general discrete-time dynamical systems" by Cristian R. Rojas and Pawe≈Ç Wachel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, it appears that the focus is more theoretical, discussing state-space representations rather than empirical experiments that typically involve datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets that might be used for validation or examples.

After reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. Since this paper is theoretical, it may not have specific datasets but could reference foundational works or datasets used in related studies.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For instance, if the paper references a dataset from a previous work, I will include that citation in the final output.

Finally, I will compile the information about any identified datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. If no datasets are found, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or mentions in methodology/experiments.
3. Check the References section for any relevant citations.
4. Compile any identified datasets with full citations.
5. Note if no datasets are found in the paper.
