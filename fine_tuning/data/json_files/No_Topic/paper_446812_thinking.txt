To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimation of Spatio-Temporal Extremes via Generative Neural Networks" by Christopher Bülte et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and application sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions an application to **precipitation extremes across Western Germany**, which suggests that there is a dataset related to precipitation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section 4 (Application)**, where the authors discuss the **HYRAS dataset**. This dataset is described as stemming from the German National Meteorological Service (DWD) and covering mean daily precipitation from 1931 until 2023 across Germany.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they fit a response surface to transform the data into unit Fréchet margins, indicating that they are using the HYRAS dataset for their analysis. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HYRAS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Deutscher Wetterdienst, HYRAS - Hydrometeorologische Rasterdaten, version 5.0 (https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/hyras/hyras.html).

Additionally, I will note that the authors reference other datasets indirectly, such as simulated datasets used for validation in their methodology, but these are not named explicitly as datasets in the same way as the HYRAS dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the HYRAS dataset in the final output.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methodology, and application sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the presence of the HYRAS dataset in the application section.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the HYRAS dataset from the references.
4. Document the dataset information clearly, ensuring to include the citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the relevant datasets from the research paper.
