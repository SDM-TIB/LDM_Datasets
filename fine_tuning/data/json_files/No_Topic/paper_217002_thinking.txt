To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability of Linear Structural Equation Models of Causal Inference" by Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Anand Louis, and Navin Goyal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of causal inference and mention the use of simulations and real-world experiments. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. The authors mention conducting simulations and real-world experiments for a sociology application. I will look for any specific datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors refer to a **sociology dataset** used in their analysis. They mention that this dataset was taken from a public Internet repository and used in a previous work. However, they do not provide a specific name for the dataset in the main text.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** for any mention of the sociology dataset. The reference provided is:

- General social survey. (2018). Retrieved from http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data.

This citation indicates that the dataset used is the General Social Survey, which is a well-known dataset in sociology.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset:

1. **Sociology Dataset**: This dataset is used for the real-world experiments described in the paper. It is sourced from the General Social Survey, which collects data on social attitudes and behaviors in the United States.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> General social survey. (2018). Retrieved from http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
