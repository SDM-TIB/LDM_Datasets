To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stylized Projected GAN: A Novel Architecture for Fast and Realistic Image Generation" by Md Nurul Muttakin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of GANs and the proposed architecture but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific references to datasets in the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for large datasets for training GANs but do not specify any datasets. This suggests that the paper may rely on existing datasets commonly used in GAN research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments using different architectures and mention specific datasets. They refer to the **FFHQ dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for high-quality face images, and the **Pokemon dataset**, which consists of 833 images used for testing their model.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **FFHQ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

2. For the **Pokemon dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is commonly referenced in GAN literature. A typical citation might be:
   > A dataset of Pokémon images can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinavpoudel/pokemon-images-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
