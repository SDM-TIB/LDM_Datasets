To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Switching Fusion with Similarity Search for Video Classification" by Lei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their system on two private industry datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **iCetanaPrivateDataset**: This dataset consists of 2,700 videos captured in outdoor environments, featuring various challenges such as tree waving and camera shaking. The authors note that it includes human motion as well. 

2. **iCetanaEventDataset**: This is an extension of the iCetanaPrivateDataset, containing 6,668 videos captured from multiple cameras across different locations, including train stations and supermarkets. 

Both datasets are noted to have been manually labeled with specific background and foreground motion class labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are proprietary and specific to the authors' work, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are described in the paper but may not have external citations.

For the **iCetanaPrivateDataset**, I will summarize:
- It contains 2,700 videos of various lengths, captured in outdoor environments with common issues like tree waving and camera shaking.

For the **iCetanaEventDataset**, I will summarize:
- It is an extension of the previous dataset, with 6,668 videos captured from multiple cameras in various locations.

Since these datasets are specific to the authors' research and do not have external citations, I will document them as follows:

- **iCetanaPrivateDataset**: Described in the paper as containing 2,700 videos captured in outdoor environments.
- **iCetanaEventDataset**: Described in the paper as an extension of the iCetanaPrivateDataset, containing 6,668 videos.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for these proprietary datasets.
