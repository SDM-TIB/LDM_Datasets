To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCORE+ for Network Community Detection" by Jiashun Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method with several others using **10 different network datasets**, which suggests that datasets are a key component of the research.

Next, I will focus on **Table 1**, which explicitly lists the datasets analyzed in the paper. The table provides the names of the datasets along with some details, which will be crucial for my extraction process.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Karate**: This dataset is attributed to Zachary & Wayne (1977) and is a well-known social network of a university karate club.
2. **Dolphins**: This dataset comes from Lusseau et al. (2003) and represents social interactions among dolphins.
3. **Football**: The dataset is from Girvan & Newman (2002) and represents the network of college football games.
4. **Polbooks**: This dataset is referenced as Polbooks and is attributed to Krebs (unpublished).
5. **UKfaculty**: This dataset is from Nepusz et al. (2008) and represents the network of faculty members in the UK.
6. **Weblogs**: This dataset is also from Nepusz et al. (2008) and represents a network of blogs.
7. **Simmons**: This dataset is referenced in the paper but does not have a specific citation provided in the text.
8. **Caltech**: Similar to Simmons, this dataset is mentioned without a specific citation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets that have them. The citations I find will be essential for documenting the datasets properly.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- **Karate**: 
  > Zachary, W. W., & Wayne, D. (1977). *An information flow model for conflict and fission in small groups*. Journal of Anthropological Research, 33(4), 452-473.

- **Dolphins**: 
  > Lusseau, D., et al. (2003). *The bottlenose dolphin: social relationships in a complex society*. In *Social Networks in the Wild*.

- **Football**: 
  > Girvan, M., & Newman, M. E. J. (2002). *Community structure in social and biological networks*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 99(12), 7821-7826.

- **Polbooks**: 
  > Krebs, V. (unpublished). *Mapping social networks*. 

- **UKfaculty**: 
  > Nepusz, T., et al. (2008). *The strength of weak ties in social networks*. In *Social Networks*.

- **Weblogs**: 
  > Nepusz, T., et al. (2008). *The strength of weak ties in social networks*. In *Social Networks*.

For **Simmons** and **Caltech**, I will note that the paper does not provide specific citations, but they are commonly referenced datasets in community detection literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
