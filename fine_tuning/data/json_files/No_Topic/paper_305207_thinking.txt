To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online learning of windmill time series using Long Short-term Cognitive Networks" by Alejandro Morales-HernÃ¡ndez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses forecasting windmill time series and mentions numerical simulations involving four windmills, which suggests that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Description of windmill datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they adopted four public datasets from the ENGIE web page, detailing that each dataset corresponds to a windmill with measurements recorded every 10 minutes from 2013 to 2017. They also specify that each dataset contains eight variables related to the windmill and environmental conditions.

The datasets are summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset 1**: Contains measurements from the first windmill.
2. **Dataset 2**: Contains measurements from the second windmill.
3. **Dataset 3**: Contains measurements from the third windmill.
4. **Dataset 4**: Contains measurements from the fourth windmill.

In the same section, the authors provide descriptive statistics for these datasets, including minimum, median, and maximum correlation values among the variables.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are publicly available from the ENGIE web page, I will cite the source directly:

- For the datasets, the citation is:
  > ENGIE. *Open Data - Renewables*. Retrieved from https://opendata-renewables.engie.com/explore/index

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and accurately reflect the information extracted from the paper.
