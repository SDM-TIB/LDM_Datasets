To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTIPATH++: EFFICIENT INFORMATION FUSION AND TRAJECTORY AGGREGATION FOR BEHAVIOR PREDICTION," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD)**: This dataset consists of 1.1 million examples time-windowed from 103,000 20-second scenarios derived from real-world driving in urban and suburban environments. Each example includes 1 second of history state and 8 seconds of future predictions, with attributes such as position, velocity, and acceleration vectors.

2. **Argoverse Dataset**: This dataset contains 333,000 scenarios with trajectory histories, context agents, and lane centerline inputs for motion prediction. The trajectories are sampled at 10Hz, with 2 seconds of past history and a 3-second future prediction horizon.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ettinger, S., Cheng, S., Caine, B., Liu, C., Zhao, H., Pradhan, S., Chai, Y., Sapp, B., Qi, C., Zhou, Y., Yang, Z., Chouard, A., Sun, P., Ngiam, J., Vasudevan, V., McCauley, A., Shlens, J., & Anguelov, D. (2021). Large scale interactive motion forecasting for autonomous driving: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.00780*.

- For the **Argoverse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chang, M.-F., Lambert, J., Sangkloy, P., Singh, J., Bak, S., Hartnett, A., Wang, D., Carr, P., Lucey, S., Ramanan, D., et al. (2019). Argoverse: 3D tracking and forecasting with rich maps. In *CVPR*.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
