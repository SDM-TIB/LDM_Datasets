To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Complexity of Opinions and Online Discussions" by Utkarsh Upadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract mentions experiments conducted on a large dataset from Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and the Newsroom app.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets. This could include sections titled "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experiments." In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in the "Experiments" section, where they provide details about the discussions and the number of comments and users involved.

3. **Extract Dataset Details**: I will extract the relevant details about the dataset mentioned:
   - **Dataset Name**: Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and Newsroom app dataset.
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of 19,800 online discussions, 685,000 comments, and 151,000 users, with a total of 4.5 million votes cast by 200,000 voters on August 8, 2017.

4. **Check for Citations**: I will then check the references section of the paper to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. If the datasets are not cited in the references, I will note that they are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts.

5. **Compile the Information**: After gathering all necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own research, I will note that the citation is the paper itself.

6. **Final Review**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.

Hereâ€™s the information I will compile:
- **Dataset Name**: Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, Yahoo! Sports, and Newsroom app dataset.
- **Description**: Contains 19,800 online discussions, 685,000 comments, and 151,000 users, with 4.5 million votes cast by 200,000 voters on August 8, 2017.
- **Citation**: Utkarsh Upadhyay, Abir De, Aasish Pappu, and Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez. *On the Complexity of Opinions and Online Discussions*. [Insert publication details if available].

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
