To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Internet of Predictable Things (IoPT) Framework to Increase Cyber-Physical System Resiliency" by Umit Cali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a cyber-physical system testbed under various cyber attack scenarios, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Scenario and Data Description)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 Load Dataset**: This dataset consists of four and a half years of historical hourly load data from 1/1/2004 to 6/30/2008 for 20 zones, plus an aggregated zone marked as zone 21. The authors specifically used the electricity load data from the aggregated zone 21.

2. **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 Solar Forecasting Dataset**: This dataset contains three years of hourly solar generation and corresponding weather data from 4/01/2012 to 04/06/2014. The authors utilized this dataset for solar PV forecasting.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 Load Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hong, T., Pinson, P., & Fan, S. (2014). Global energy forecasting competition 2012. 

- For the **Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 Solar Forecasting Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hong, T., Pinson, P., Zareipour, H., Troccoli, A., & Hyndman, R. J. (2016). Probabilistic energy forecasting: Global energy forecasting competition 2014 and beyond.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
