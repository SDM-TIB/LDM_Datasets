To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Developments in Program Synthesis with Evolutionary Algorithms" by Dominik Sobania et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmark problems.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors discuss the general program synthesis benchmark suite. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may reference the datasets again when discussing the performance of various program synthesis approaches. This will help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide additional context.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

From my reading, I expect to find at least one key dataset mentioned, which is the **general program synthesis benchmark suite**. I will document this dataset with its full citation:

- **General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite**: 
  > T. Helmuth and L. Spector. *General program synthesis benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation, 2015, pp. 1039â€“1046.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
