To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-Based Framework for Understanding Car-Following Behaviors of Drivers in A Naturalistic Driving Environment" by Armstrong Aboah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of naturalistic driving data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention using **Blackbox sensors** installed in vehicles to gather data, which includes high-resolution cameras, infrared sensors, and GPS. This indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world driving scenarios, but I need to find the specific name or title of the dataset.

In this section, the authors specify that the study involved **77 participants** and collected data over a distance of **289,682 kilometers**. They also mention that the dataset contains detailed information on driver behavior across various geographic environments. However, they also note that they utilized data from a smaller subset of individuals, specifically **two elderly drivers and two young drivers**, constituting **65 minutes of driving video data**.

The paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, but it does describe the nature of the data collected. Therefore, I will refer to this dataset as the **Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) dataset** for the purpose of citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the data collection methods or the Blackbox sensors used. However, the references primarily focus on previous studies and methodologies rather than providing a formal citation for the dataset itself.

Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own data collection efforts, I will create a citation for it based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset.

Hereâ€™s how I will summarize the datasets:

1. **Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) dataset**: This dataset includes driving behavior data collected from 77 participants using Blackbox sensors over a distance of 289,682 kilometers, focusing on various demographic groups.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be easily accessed or cited in future research.
