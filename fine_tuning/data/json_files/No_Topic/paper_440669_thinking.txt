To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning Large Language Models with Self-generated Preference Data" by Dongyoung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a small amount of human-annotated preference data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the challenges of acquiring large-scale human-annotated preference data. They refer to the **Ultrafeedback dataset**, which is likely a key dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors state that they utilized the **UltraFeedback dataset** for preference learning, which consists of 2,000 samples with prompts, responses, and ground truth preference labels. They also mention dividing the remaining samples into subsets for iterative training.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **UltraFeedback dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:
> G. Cui, L. Yuan, N. Ding, G. Yao, W. Zhu, Y. Ni, G. Xie, Z. Liu, and M. Sun. *Ultrafeedback: Boosting language models with high-quality feedback*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.01377, 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

The only dataset mentioned in this paper is the **UltraFeedback dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
