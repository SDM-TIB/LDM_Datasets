To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Same Author or Just Same Topic? Towards Content-Independent Style Representations" by Anna Wegmann, Marijn Schraagen, and Dong Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relevance of linguistic style and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any references to specific datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using utterances from the platform Reddit, which indicates that they are utilizing a specific dataset derived from Reddit conversations. I will look for details about how this dataset was constructed, including any specific sampling methods or criteria.

In the **results section**, the authors may provide additional context about the datasets used in their experiments, including any performance metrics or comparisons that rely on these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The paper mentions the use of the "Pushshift Reddit dataset" and "ConvoKit" for data extraction. I will ensure to retrieve the complete citations for these datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

1. For the **Pushshift Reddit dataset**:
   > Jason Baumgartner, Savvas Zannettou, Brian Keegan, Megan Squire, and Jeremy Blackburn. *The Pushshift Reddit dataset*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, pages 830–839, Atlanta, USA, 2020.

2. For **ConvoKit**:
   > Jonathan P. Chang, Caleb Chiam, Liye Fu, Andrew Wang, Justine Zhang, and Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil. *ConvoKit: A toolkit for the analysis of conversations*. In Proceedings of the 21st Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 57–60, 1st virtual meeting, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
