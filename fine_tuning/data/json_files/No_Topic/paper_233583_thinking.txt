To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attack-Resistant Federated Learning with Residual-based Reweighting" by Shuhao Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on four datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their evaluations. They mention:

1. **MNIST dataset**: This dataset consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images, which are commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **CIFAR-10 dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 natural images across ten different object classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

3. **Amazon Reviews dataset**: This dataset includes product reviews and ratings from Amazon, specifically focusing on book reviews from the Kindle Store, with a total of 86,164 training reviews and 13,260 test reviews.

4. **Lending Club Loan dataset**: This dataset contains financial information for loan status prediction, with 1,808,534 samples across various loan statuses.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y.; Bottou, L.; Bengio, Y.; and Haffner, P. 1998. Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE 86(11): 2278â€“2324.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A.; Hinton, G.; et al. 2009. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, CiteSeer.

- For the **Amazon Reviews dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruining, H.; and Julian, M. 2016. Ups and Downs: Modeling the Visual Evolution of Fashion Trends with One-Class Collaborative Filtering.

- For the **Lending Club Loan dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kan, W. 2019. Lending Club Loan Data. URL https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
