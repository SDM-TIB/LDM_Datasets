To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive pooling operators for weakly labeled sound event detection" by Brian McFee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed methods are evaluated on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **URBAN-SED**: This dataset consists of 10,000 soundscapes generated using the Scaper soundscape synthesis library, totaling 27.8 hours of audio with 50,000 annotated sound events from 10 sound classes. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test splits.

2. **DCASE 2017 Task 4**: This dataset is a subset of the AudioSet dataset, containing over 50,000 10-second excerpts from YouTube videos. It is split into a development set and an evaluation set, with weak labels generated semi-automatically and strong labels manually annotated for validation and test sets.

3. **MedleyDB**: A collection of 122 multi-track recordings from various musical genres, which includes time-varying instrument activation labels. The dataset is expanded through data augmentation techniques to create different mixtures of the recordings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **URBAN-SED**, the citation is:
  > Salamon, J., & Bello, J. P. (2017). Scaper: A library for soundscape synthesis and augmentation. In IEEE WASPAA, pp. 344–348.

- For **DCASE 2017 Task 4**, the citation is:
  > Mesaros, A., Heittola, T., Diment, A., Elizalde, B., Shah, A., Vincent, E., Raj, B., & Virtanen, T. (2017). DCASE 2017 challenge setup: Tasks, datasets and baseline system. In DCASE 2017 Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events.

- For **MedleyDB**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
