To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Weighted Ensemble Learning Based Agent for the Werewolf Game" by Mohiuddeen Khan and Claus Aranha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the AI Wolf competition and the agents used, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection section** where the authors describe how they generated datasets. They mention creating a CSV file for each agent by targeting that agent for 500 games, which suggests that there is a dataset generated from this process. The details about the data attributes collected (positive talks, negative length, and vote) are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In the **Tables section**, specifically Table III, the authors provide an example dataset generated by targeting the "Takeda" agent. This table outlines the attributes collected, which confirms the existence of a dataset. 

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors cite various works related to ensemble learning and AI competitions, but they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset they generated. However, I can note that the dataset is derived from the AI Wolf competition, which is referenced in the paper.

The relevant datasets I will extract are:

1. **AI Wolf Competition Dataset**: This dataset is generated by targeting different agents (Takeda, Wasabi, Viking, Daisyo, and Sample) and collecting data over 500 games. The dataset includes attributes such as positive talks, negative length, and voting behavior.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Mohiuddeen Khan and Claus Aranha. *A Novel Weighted Ensemble Learning Based Agent for the Werewolf Game*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset information and citations into a structured format for further processing.
