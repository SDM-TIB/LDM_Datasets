To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shadows of Quantum Machine Learning" by Sofiene Jerbi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. This section often includes descriptions of the datasets, their sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any specific names or identifiers for the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
