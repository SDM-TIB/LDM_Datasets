To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inferring Which Medical Treatments Work from Reports of Clinical Trials" by Eric Lehman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a new corpus for inferring findings from clinical trial reports, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of synthesizing findings from clinical trials and mention the creation of a new corpus comprising **10,000+ prompts coupled with full-text articles describing RCTs**. This indicates that the corpus itself is a dataset.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the **annotation** subsection, the authors detail the process of generating prompts and annotating them. They mention that the dataset consists of **10,137 annotated prompts for 2,419 unique articles**. This provides specific details about the dataset's size and structure.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or specific references to other datasets used in their experiments. However, the primary dataset appears to be the corpus they created.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset is the corpus created by the authors, which does not have a separate citation but is described in detail in the paper. Therefore, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **corpus of prompts and articles**, the citation is:
  > Eric Lehman, Jay B. DeYoung, Regina Barzilay, and Byron C. Wallace. *Inferring Which Medical Treatments Work from Reports of Clinical Trials*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2023.

Since there are no other datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Corpus of Clinical Trial Reports**: A dataset comprising over 10,000 prompts and full-text articles describing randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
