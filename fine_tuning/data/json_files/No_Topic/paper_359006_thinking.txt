To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAN WE USE COMMON VOICE TO TRAIN A MULTI-SPEAKER TTS SYSTEM?" by Sewade Ogun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Common Voice English dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will delve into **section 3 (The Common Voice Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They describe it as a crowdsourced, Creative Commons Zero licensed dataset with recordings from volunteers. This section outlines its properties, limitations, and how it is utilized in their experiments.

In addition to the Common Voice dataset, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The introduction references **LibriTTS**, which is another dataset used for comparison in their experiments. I will ensure to gather details about both datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **Common Voice dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ardila, R., Branson, M., Davis, K., et al. "Common Voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus." In Proceedings of the LREC, 2020, pp. 4211–4215.

2. For the **LibriTTS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zen, H., Dang, V., Clark, R., et al. "LibriTTS: A corpus derived from LibriSpeech for text-to-speech." In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2019, pp. 1526–1530.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
