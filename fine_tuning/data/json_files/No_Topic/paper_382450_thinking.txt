To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Background Knowledge Grounding for Readable, Relevant, and Factual Biomedical Lay Summaries" by Domenic Rosati, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. In the abstract, the author mentions using the **BioLaySum summarization dataset** to evaluate their method, which indicates that this is a key dataset to note.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **BioLaySum dataset** in the **method section**. Here, the author provides a description of the dataset, stating that it contains **29,119 training samples** (with **24,773 from PLOS** and **4,346 from eLife**) and **1,617 validation samples** (with **1,376 from PLOS** and **241 from eLife**). This detailed breakdown is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the author reiterates the use of the **BioLaySum dataset** for evaluating the summarization quality, confirming its significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **BioLaySum dataset**. The citation provided is:
> Goldsack, T., Zhang, Z., Lin, C., & Scarton, C. (2022). Making Science Simple: Corpora for the Lay Summarisation of Scientific Literature. ArXiv:2210.09932 [cs].

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation and relevant details, ready for any further processing or review.
