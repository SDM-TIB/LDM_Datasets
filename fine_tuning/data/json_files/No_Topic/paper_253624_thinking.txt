To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CCA: Exploring the Possibility of Contextual Camouflage Attack on Object Detection" by Shengnan Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a contextual camouflage attack algorithm, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they built a simulation environment using the Unreal Engine, which includes various vehicles and environments. They state that they sequentially camouflaged and placed a professionally modeled Camry 2015 XLE in different locations. This indicates that they created a custom dataset for their experiments.

The authors also mention that they recorded RGB images and ground truth of the vehicle and surrounding area from 20 fixed camera orientations. They manually labeled the ground truth of vehicles into two categories: the camouflaged vehicle and the normal ones. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, which is a limitation.

To ensure I have all relevant information, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets or related works. However, the references primarily cite papers related to object detection and adversarial attacks, rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the dataset they created, I will note that the dataset is based on a simulation environment built with Unreal Engine, and it includes images of a Camry 2015 XLE in various locations. I will summarize this information as follows:

1. **Custom Dataset from Unreal Engine Simulation**: This dataset includes RGB images and ground truth annotations for a Camry 2015 XLE and surrounding vehicles, captured from 20 fixed camera orientations. The dataset is not formally named or cited in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the lack of formal citation for the dataset while providing a clear description of its contents and purpose.
