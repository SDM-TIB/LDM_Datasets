To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Aware Object Geotagging" by Chao-Jung Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses improving asset geolocation from street view imagery and mentions using contextual geographic information from OpenStreetMap (OSM). This suggests that OSM might be a dataset or source of data used in their methodology.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **experimental results** sections. In the methods section, the authors describe their approach using panoramic street view images and metadata. They mention using **Google Street View (GSV)** images, which indicates that this is a dataset they utilized for their experiments.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors state that they used **896 GSV images** collected in Dublin city center. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant datasets identified are:

1. **Google Street View (GSV)**: The authors utilized images from GSV for their experiments. The citation for GSV is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I can reference the general source:
   > Google. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview.

2. **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: The authors mention using contextual information extracted from OSM. Similar to GSV, the citation is not explicitly provided, but I can reference the general source:
   > OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap*. Available at: https://www.openstreetmap.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
