To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A primary insight into the molecular phylogeny of Colias FABRICIUS, 1807 (Pieridae, Coliadinae) complex of South America" by Alexander V. Kir’yanov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involved barcoding 93 specimens of South American Colias species and 2 outgroup specimens. This suggests that there is a dataset related to these specimens.

Next, I will examine the **Materials** section, where the author provides detailed information about the specimens used for barcoding. It states that 93 individuals were collected from South America, representing almost all species and subspecies of the genus Colias recognized in that region. The outgroup specimen is identified as C. philodice guatemalena from North America.

In the **Methods** section, the author describes the DNA extraction and sequencing process, indicating that the data generated from these specimens were uploaded to the BOLD database. This suggests that the dataset is accessible for further research.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the dataset. In **Table 1**, the author lists the taxa, their designations, numbers of sequenced specimens, localities, and host plants. This table is crucial as it provides a structured overview of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **SACOL Dataset**: This dataset consists of 93 specimens of South American Colias species, which were barcoded for molecular phylogenetic analysis. The specimens were collected from various locations across South America, including Colombia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina.

2. **Outgroup Dataset**: This dataset includes 2 specimens of C. philodice guatemalena, which were used as an outgroup reference for the phylogenetic analysis.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SACOL Dataset**:
  > Kir’yanov, A.V. (2023). A primary insight into the molecular phylogeny of Colias FABRICIUS, 1807 (Pieridae, Coliadinae) complex of South America. *Centro de Investigaciones en Optica*.

- For the **C. philodice guatemalena Dataset**:
  > Emmel, T.C. (1963). Colias philodice in Chiapas, Mexico. *Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera*, 1, 194.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its citation for future reference or analysis.
