To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handwriting Prediction Considering Inter-Class Bifurcation Structures" by Masaki Yamagata et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model was evaluated on the **UNIPEN online handwritten character dataset**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed used, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **UNIPEN database (Train-R01/V07, 1a)**, which contains online handwritten digits as sequences of two-dimensional coordinates. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its structure and the number of sequences.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UNIPEN dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **UNIPEN dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Guyon, L. Schomaker, R. Plamondon, M. Liberman, and S. Janet. *UNIPEN Project of On-line Data Exchange and Recognizer Benchmarks*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 1994.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the UNIPEN dataset for its experiments, this will be the only dataset I need to extract and cite.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness.
