To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structural Entities Extraction and Patient Indications Incorporation for Chest X-ray Report Generation" by Kang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset, which is a significant clue that I should investigate further.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset in section 3.1 (Datasets), where they describe its use for evaluating their proposed method. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the partitioning settings used for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Johnson, A.E.W., Pollard, T.J., Greenbaum, N.R., Lungren, M.P., Deng, C.Y., Peng, Y., Lu, Z., Mark, R.G., Berkowitz, S.J., Horng, S. (2019). MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042*.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its significance in the context of the research.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included in full.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Identify the datasets section or relevant mentions in the methodology/experiments.
3. Extract details about the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.
5. Document the dataset entry with all necessary details and the citation.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
