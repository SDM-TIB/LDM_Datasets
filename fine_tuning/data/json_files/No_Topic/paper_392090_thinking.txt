To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Kernel-Modulated Neural Representation for Efficient Light Field Compression" by Jinglei Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "four synthetic scenes" from the HCI dataset and "four real-world scenes" from the EPFL light field dataset. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, particularly the **Experimental Settings** subsection, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that they used:

1. **HCI Dataset**: This dataset includes four synthetic scenes: 'boxes', 'sideboard', 'cotton', and 'dino'.
2. **EPFL Light Field Dataset**: This dataset consists of four real-world scenes: 'Bikes', 'Danger', 'FountainVincent2', and 'StonePillarsOutside'.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **HCI Dataset**, the citation is:
> K. Honauer, O. Johannsen, D. Kondermann, and B. Goldluecke. *A dataset and evaluation methodology for depth estimation on 4D light fields*. In Asian Conf. Comput. Vis. (ACCV), pages 19–34, 2016.

For the **EPFL Light Field Dataset**, the citation is:
> M. Rerabek and T. Ebrahimi. *New light field image dataset*. In Int. Conf. on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX), number EPFL-CONF-218363, 2016.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

1. **HCI Dataset**: Contains synthetic scenes used for testing.
   - Citation: K. Honauer, O. Johannsen, D. Kondermann, and B. Goldluecke. *A dataset and evaluation methodology for depth estimation on 4D light fields*. In Asian Conf. Comput. Vis. (ACCV), pages 19–34, 2016.

2. **EPFL Light Field Dataset**: Contains real-world scenes used for testing.
   - Citation: M. Rerabek and T. Ebrahimi. *New light field image dataset*. In Int. Conf. on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX), number EPFL-CONF-218363, 2016.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
