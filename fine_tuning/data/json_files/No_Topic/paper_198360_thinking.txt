To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Gradient Algorithms for Norm-Regularized Smooth Convex Optimization" by Zaid Harchaoui, Anatoli Juditsky, and Arkadi Nemirovski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Applications."** These sections usually detail the datasets used for testing the algorithms or methods proposed in the paper.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will focus on any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to note their full names and any specific versions or subsets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary bibliographic information for each dataset, which may include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "MNIST dataset," I would look for its full citation, which typically includes:
- Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the References section of the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
