To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UC-OWOD: Unknown-Classified Open World Object Detection" by Zhiheng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of images, instances, and any specific classes included.

In the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Pascal VOC** and **MS-COCO** datasets for their experiments. They provide a detailed breakdown of how these datasets are utilized across different tasks. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Pascal VOC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. "The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, 88(2), 303–338, 2010.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." *Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 740–755, 2014.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
