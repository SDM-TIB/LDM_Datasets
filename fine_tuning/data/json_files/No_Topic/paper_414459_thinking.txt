To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "FedA3I: Annotation Quality-Aware Aggregation for Federated Medical Image Segmentation against Heterogeneous Annotation Noise" by Nannan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world medical image segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find that they mention two datasets:

1. **ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset (SKIN)**: This dataset contains 2000 images for training and 600 images for testing. It is widely used for skin lesion segmentation tasks.

2. **Breast Ultrasound Datasets (BREAST)**: This includes three datasets for breast tumor segmentation, specifically BUS, BUSIS, and UDIAT. The authors note that these datasets are used for training and testing in a federated learning context.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset**:
  > Codella, N. C.; Gutman, D.; Celebi, M. E.; Helba, B.; Marchetti, M. A.; Dusza, S. W.; Kalloo, A.; Liopyris, K.; Mishra, N.; Kittler, H.; et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. In ISBI, pages 168â€“172, 2018.

- For the **Breast Ultrasound Datasets**:
  > Al-Dhabyani, W.; Gomaa, M.; Khaled, H.; and Fahmy, A. *Dataset of breast ultrasound images*. Data in brief, 28: 104863, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
