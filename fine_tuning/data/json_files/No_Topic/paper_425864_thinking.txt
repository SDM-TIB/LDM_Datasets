To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Prompt Multi-task Network for Abuse Language Detection" by Jian Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated against three public datasets: **OLID**, **SOLID**, and **AbuseAnalyzer**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In the experiments section, the authors confirm that they used the **OLID**, **SOLID**, and **AbuseAnalyzer** datasets for evaluating their model's performance. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

1. For the **OLID dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.09666, 2019.

2. For the **SOLID dataset**, the citation is:
   > Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Marcos Zampieri, and Preslav Nakov. *A large-scale semi-supervised dataset for offensive language identification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14454, 2020.

3. For the **AbuseAnalyzer dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mohit Chandra, Ashwin Pathak, Eesha Dutta, Paryul Jain, Manish Gupta, Manish Shrivastava, and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru. *AbuseAnalyzer: Abuse detection, severity and target prediction for gab posts*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 6277â€“6283. International Committee on Computational Linguistics, December 2020.

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets with their citations:
- OLID Dataset: Zampieri et al. (2019)
- SOLID Dataset: Rosenthal et al. (2020)
- AbuseAnalyzer Dataset: Chandra et al. (2020)

This structured approach ensures that I have comprehensively covered the datasets used in the research paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
