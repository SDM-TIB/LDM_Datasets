To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Eco-Driving Control in Electrified Connected and Autonomous Vehicles using Approximate Dynamic Programming" by Shreshta Rajakumar Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference specific datasets used for their experiments or simulations. I will take note of any datasets that are mentioned and their relevance to the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training, validation, or testing. This section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the research.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments in relation to the datasets. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the "SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)" for traffic simulation, I will look for the original paper or documentation that describes this dataset to provide a complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in the final output.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
