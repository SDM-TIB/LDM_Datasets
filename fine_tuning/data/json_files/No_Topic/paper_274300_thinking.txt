To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Systematic Asset Allocation using Flexible Views for South African Markets" by Ann Sebastian and Tim Gebbie, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the data used for their analysis. In this paper, they mention using **monthly data of five asset classes and ten state variables** over a period of approximately 19 years (from February 1998 to December 2017). This indicates that there are specific datasets related to asset classes and state variables.

In the **data section**, the authors provide a detailed list of asset classes and state variables, including their Bloomberg codes. The asset classes mentioned are:

1. **Resource**: FTSE/JSE Africa Resource 10 Index (RESI20 Index)
2. **Industrial**: FTSE/JSE Africa Industrial 25 Index (INDI25 Index)
3. **Financial**: FTSE/JSE Africa Financial 15 Index (FINI15 Index)
4. **All Bond**: ALBI Total Return Index (ALBTR Index)
5. **Currency**: USDZAR Currency (USDZAR Curncy)

The state variables include indicators such as **SA Real Gross Domestic Product**, **SA Consumer Price Index**, and others, which are also sourced from Bloomberg.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from Bloomberg, I will note that the specific datasets do not have traditional academic citations but are instead referenced by their Bloomberg codes.

For the asset classes, I will summarize the information as follows:

- **Resource**: FTSE/JSE Africa Resource 10 Index (RESI20 Index)
- **Industrial**: FTSE/JSE Africa Industrial 25 Index (INDI25 Index)
- **Financial**: FTSE/JSE Africa Financial 15 Index (FINI15 Index)
- **All Bond**: ALBI Total Return Index (ALBTR Index)
- **Currency**: USDZAR Currency (USDZAR Curncy)

For the state variables, I will summarize them as follows:

1. **SA Real Gross Domestic Product**: SAGDPANN Index
2. **SA Domestic Leading Indicator**: OEZAKLAP Index
3. **SA Consumer Price Index**: SACPIYOY Index
4. **SA Money Supply**: SAMYM3Y Index
5. **SA Equity Momentum**: JPEIGLBL Index
6. **JP Morgan EMBI Index**: USDZAR Curncy
7. **USD ZAR Currency**: USDZAR Curncy
8. **USA PMI**: NAPMPMI Index
9. **USA VIX Index**: VIX Index
10. **Equity Risk Premium (USA-SA)**: SPX Index

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations as needed. The focus will be on accurately representing the datasets and their sources for clarity and future reference.
