To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concatenated Classic and Neural (CCN) Codes" by Onur Günlü et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses improvements in error correction using neural networks but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for practical channel codes and the role of neural networks in error correction. However, they do not specify any datasets here either. I will continue to the **training and experimental results section** where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

In **section IV (Training and Experimental Results)**, the authors describe their experiments with a (7, 4) neural code and a CCN code that concatenates an outer Reed-Solomon (RS) code. They mention training the inner neural encoder-decoder pairs using a dataset of 1,000,000 samples over 5 epochs. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **acknowledgment and references sections** for any additional information about datasets. The acknowledgment section mentions support from various grants but does not specify datasets. The references section lists various papers but does not provide specific datasets either.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset for Training Neural Encoder-Decoder Pairs**: The authors mention using a dataset of 1,000,000 samples for training, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset.

2. **Reed-Solomon Codes**: While the paper discusses the use of Reed-Solomon codes, it does not provide a dataset associated with these codes.

Given that there are no specific datasets mentioned with citations in the paper, I will note that the authors did not provide full citations for any datasets used in their experiments.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper discusses a dataset used for training but does not provide a specific name or citation for it. This indicates a gap in the documentation of datasets within the paper, which is important for reproducibility in research.
