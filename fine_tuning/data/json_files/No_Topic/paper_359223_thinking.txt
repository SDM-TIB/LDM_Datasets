To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Getting higher on rugged landscapes: Inversion mutations open access to fitter adaptive peaks in NK fitness landscapes" by Leonardo Trujillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and any datasets used for simulations or analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using a computational model to simulate adaptive walks, but I need to check if they reference any specific datasets or data sources for their simulations.

I will also examine the **results section** for any tables or figures that might summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. If the authors refer to any datasets used in their simulations or analyses, I will note them down.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to reflect the datasets' details and their sources.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the information presented.
