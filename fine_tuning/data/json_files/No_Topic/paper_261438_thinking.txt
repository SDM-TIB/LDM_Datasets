To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural text normalization leveraging similarities of strings and sounds" by Riku Kawamura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed models achieved higher F1 scores on the WNUT-2015 task, which suggests that this task involves a specific dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental settings. Here, they explicitly mention using the **WNUT-2015 Shared Task dataset**, which consists of 4,917 tweets with 373 non-standard words. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WNUT-2015 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **WNUT-2015 Shared Task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Timothy Baldwin, Marie Catherine de Marneffe, Bo Han, Young-Bum Kim, Alan Ritter, and Wei Xu. *Shared tasks of the 2015 workshop on noisy user-generated text: Twitter lexical normalization and named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text, pages 126â€“135, Beijing, China, July. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the WNUT-2015 dataset.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WNUT-2015 Shared Task dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
