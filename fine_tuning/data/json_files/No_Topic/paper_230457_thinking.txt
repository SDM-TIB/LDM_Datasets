To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness-Aware Neural RÃ©nyi Minimization for Continuous Features" by Vincent Grari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to any mentions of datasets used for empirical assessments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Empirical Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets used in their evaluations:

1. **US Census Demographic Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the 2015 American Community Survey and contains 37 features about 74,000 American census tracts. The goal is to predict the percentage of children below the poverty line, with gender as a sensitive attribute.

2. **Motor Insurance Dataset**: This dataset originates from a pricing game organized by The French Institute of Actuaries in 2015, containing 15 attributes for 36,311 observations. The task is to predict the average claim cost of third-party material claims per policy, using the driver's age as the sensitive attribute.

3. **Crime Dataset**: Obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, this dataset includes 128 attributes for 1,994 instances from US communities. The task is to predict the number of violent crimes per population, with race information as the sensitive attribute.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **US Census Demographic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Census Bureau. (2015). *American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates*. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/

- For the **Motor Insurance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Institute of Actuaries of France. (2015). *Pricing Game 2015*. Retrieved from https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/20191

- For the **Crime Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
