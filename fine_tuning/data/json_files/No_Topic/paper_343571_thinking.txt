To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DGSVis: Visual Analysis of Hierarchical Snapshots in Dynamic Graph" by Baofeng Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of basketball player networks in a competition, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the study. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Data Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their work. Here, they specifically mention the basketball player networks based on an NBA competition between the New Orleans Pelicans (NOP) and the Golden State Warriors (GSW) on October 27, 2015. This section provides critical details about the dataset, including the number of player networks (over 8,000) and the time granularity (approximately 0.3 seconds).

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the play-by-play (PBP) data, which is also essential for understanding the context of the basketball player networks. I will ensure to include this in my dataset extraction.

The full citation for the basketball player networks dataset is:
> Chang, B., Zhu, S., Jiang, Q., Xia, W., Tang, J., Pan, L., Liang, R., & Sun, G. (2015). *DGSVis: Visual Analysis of Hierarchical Snapshots in Dynamic Graph*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will help in maintaining the integrity of the data and provide proper credit to the original authors.
