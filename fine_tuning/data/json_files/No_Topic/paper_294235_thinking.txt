To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ambient PMU Data Based System Oscillation Analysis Using Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition" by Shutang You, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case studies sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated using **two real-world datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **introduction** and **case studies** sections. In the introduction, the author discusses the importance of ambient measurements but does not specify the datasets. However, in the **case studies section**, the author provides details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In **Table 5**, the paper outlines the two cases studied:

1. **FNET/GridEye ambient frequency measurements in Europe**: This dataset consists of ambient frequency measurements collected from multiple locations in the European power grid.

2. **FNET/GridEye ambient and event measurements in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection**: This dataset includes both ambient measurements and measurements from a generation trip event in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection system.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the FNET/GridEye system, which is a well-known dataset in the field of power systems. The relevant citation for the FNET/GridEye system is:

- For **FNET/GridEye**:
  > Liu, Y., et al. "A distribution level wide area monitoring system for the electric power gridâ€“FNET/GridEye." IEEE Access, 2017. 5: p. 2329-2338.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **FNET/GridEye ambient frequency measurements in Europe**: This dataset is used to analyze oscillation modes based on ambient measurements in the European power grid.

2. **FNET/GridEye ambient and event measurements in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection**: This dataset includes ambient measurements and event data from a generation trip in the U.S. Eastern Interconnection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
