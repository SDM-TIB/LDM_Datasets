To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pooled Bewley Estimator of Long Run Relationships in Dynamic Heterogeneous Panels" by Alexander Chudik, M. Hashem Pesaran, and Ron P. Smith, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the pooled Bewley estimator to an empirical application of the aggregate consumption function, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors reference an empirical application to the aggregate consumption function, which is based on data from Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999). This indicates that there is a specific dataset being used.

In the **empirical application section**, the authors mention using a dataset that consists of 24 countries with a time period covering 1960-1993. This is a clear indication of the dataset being utilized for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used in the empirical application is:

- For the dataset from Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (1999):
  > Pesaran, M. H., Shin, Y., & Smith, R. P. (1999). Pooled mean group estimation of dynamic heterogeneous panels. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 94(446), 621-634.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

In summary, the steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify the datasets section or relevant mentions in methodology/experiments.
3. Note the specific dataset used for the empirical application.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Prepare the dataset entries for output.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
