To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reward Systems for Trustworthy Medical Federated Learning" by Konstantin D. Pandl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their work using "multiple chest X-ray datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three large chest X-ray datasets:

1. **NIH ChestX-ray8 (NIH)**: This dataset contains 112,120 chest X-ray scans with corresponding labels about the patient's sex, age, and medical conditions.

2. **CheXpert (CXP)**: This dataset includes 223,414 chest X-ray scans, also with labels regarding patient demographics and medical conditions.

3. **MIMIC-CXR (CXR)**: This dataset consists of 377,095 chest X-ray scans, with similar labeling information as the other two datasets.

The authors provide a brief overview of the datasets, including their sizes and the types of labels they contain, which is crucial for understanding their relevance to the study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NIH ChestX-ray8**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Y. Peng, L. Lu, Z. Lu, M. Bagheri, and R. M. Summers. "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2017, pp. 2097-2106.

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, J., et al. "CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison." arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07031, 2019.

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., et al. "MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports." Scientific Data, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 1-8, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
