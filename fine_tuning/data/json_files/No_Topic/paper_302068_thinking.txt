To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attacking Adversarial Attacks as A Defense" by Boxi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and ImageNet, which suggests that these datasets may be relevant.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **related work section** (Section 2), I will check if there are any references to other datasets that might have been used in previous studies or comparisons. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the methods and their evaluations rather than additional datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, the citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

With this information, I will prepare the final output for review or further processing.
