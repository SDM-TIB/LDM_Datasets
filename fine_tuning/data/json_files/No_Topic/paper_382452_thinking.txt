To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Considerations for Ethical Speech Recognition Datasets" by Orestis Papakyriakopoulos and Alice Xiang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the importance of ethical considerations in speech datasets, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it sets the stage for understanding the context in which datasets are discussed.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Data & Diversity)** closely. This section discusses the limitations of existing datasets in speech technologies and mentions that most ASR models are trained using open-source datasets or web-crawled data. While it highlights issues related to dataset diversity, it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **references** section to identify any datasets that might be cited. The references include several papers that may describe datasets used in the context of speech recognition. I will pay particular attention to the citations that might correspond to datasets mentioned in the text.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following datasets that are relevant:

1. **CMU Wilderness Multilingual Speech Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in [2] and is relevant for understanding linguistic diversity in speech recognition. The citation is:
   > Alan W Black. 2019. *CMU Wilderness Multilingual Speech Dataset*. In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 5971â€“5975.

2. **Gigaspeech**: This dataset is mentioned in reference [3] and is significant for its large-scale application in ASR. The citation is:
   > Guoguo Chen, Shuzhou Chai, Guanbo Wang, Jiayu Du, Wei-Qiang Zhang, Chao Weng, Dan Su, Daniel Povey, Jan Trmal, Junbo Zhang, et al. 2021. *Gigaspeech: An evolving, multi-domain ASR corpus with 10,000 hours of transcribed audio*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.06909 (2021).

3. **Voxpopuli**: This dataset is referenced in [10] and is important for multilingual speech recognition. The citation is:
   > Changhan Wang, Morgane Riviere, Ann Lee, Anne Wu, Chaitanya Talnikar, Daniel Haziza, Mary Williamson, Juan Pino, and Emmanuel Dupoux. 2021. *Voxpopuli: A large-scale multilingual speech corpus for representation learning, semi-supervised learning and interpretation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00390 (2021).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. I will summarize the key points about each dataset, such as their purpose and relevance to the paper's discussion on ethical considerations in speech recognition.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
