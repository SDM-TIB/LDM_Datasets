To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Common Appearance-Boundary Adaptation for Nighttime Optical Flow" by Hanyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments have been performed on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. Specifically, they refer to a synthetic dataset synthesized by a noise model on KITTI2015, named **(noise) Dark-KITTI2015**. They also mention two real datasets: **Dark-GOF** and **Dark-DSEC**, which are the nighttime parts of existing datasets.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors introduce a new dataset called **LLFE (Low Light Frame-Event)**, which covers various nighttime illumination conditions. They note that Dark-DSEC and LLFE are paired frame-event datasets obtained via stereo rectification and coaxial optical systems.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **(noise) Dark-KITTI2015**: This dataset is based on the original KITTI dataset, which is cited as:
   > Moritz Menze and Andreas Geiger. *Object scene flow for autonomous vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3061–3070, 2015.

2. **Dark-GOF**: This dataset is part of the work by Li et al. (2021), which is cited as:
   > Haipeng Li, Kunming Luo, and Shuaicheng Liu. *Gyroflow: Gyroscope-guided unsupervised optical flow learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 12869–12878, 2021.

3. **Dark-DSEC**: This dataset is referenced from the work by Gehrig et al. (2021), which is cited as:
   > Mathias Gehrig, Willem Aarents, Daniel Gehrig, and Davide Scaramuzza. *DSEC: A stereo event camera dataset for driving scenarios*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2021.

4. **LLFE**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, as it appears to be a new dataset introduced in this work.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
