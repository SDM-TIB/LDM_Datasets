To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Contrastive Positive Mining for Unsupervised 3D Action Representation Learning" by Haoyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the **NTU and PKU-MMD datasets**, indicating that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 (NTU-60)**: This dataset consists of 56,880 action clips performed by 40 different actors across 60 action categories. The clips are captured using three cameras simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of the actions.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 (NTU-120)**: An extended version of NTU-60, this dataset contains 114,480 action clips across 120 action categories. The experimental settings are similar to those of NTU-60.

3. **PKU-MMD Dataset**: This dataset includes nearly 20,000 action clips across 51 action categories. It has two subsets, PKU-MMD I and PKU-MMD II, with the latter being more challenging due to a higher level of noise.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D 60 (NTU-60)**, the citation is:

- For **NTU RGB+D 120 (NTU-120)**, the citation is:

- For **PKU-MMD Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
