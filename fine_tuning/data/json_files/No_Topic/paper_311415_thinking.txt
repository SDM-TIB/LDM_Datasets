To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuroCartography: Scalable Automatic Visual Summarization of Concepts in Deep Neural Networks" by Haekyu Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that NEUROCARTOGRAPHY scales to large data, specifically the **ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images**. This indicates that a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the use of **InceptionV1**, which is a model trained on the ImageNet dataset. This reinforces the importance of the ImageNet dataset in their research.

In the **design goals and techniques sections**, the authors describe their methods but do not introduce any new datasets. They primarily utilize existing datasets for their experiments. The mention of **ImageNet** is crucial as it serves as the foundational dataset for their work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sergey Ma, Z. Huang, Andre Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used in this research is the ImageNet dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the ImageNet dataset.
