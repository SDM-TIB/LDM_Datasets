To extract datasets from the research paper titled "dMFEA-II: An Adaptive Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm for Permutation-based Discrete Optimization Problems" by Eneko Osaba et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed over multiple datasets related to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP). This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they assess the performance of their algorithm using **8 instances of TSP and CVRP**. Specifically, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **TSP Instances**:
   - **berlin52**: An instance from the TSPLIB repository with 52 cities.
   - **eil51**: Another instance from TSPLIB with 51 cities.
   - **st70**: A TSP instance with 70 cities.
   - **eil76**: A TSP instance with 76 cities.

2. **CVRP Instances**:
   - **P-n50-k7**: A CVRP instance with 50 customers and 7 vehicles from the Augerat Benchmark.
   - **P-n50-k8**: Another CVRP instance with 50 customers and 8 vehicles.
   - **P-n55-k7**: A CVRP instance with 55 customers and 7 vehicles.
   - **P-n55-k8**: A CVRP instance with 55 customers and 8 vehicles.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The TSP instances are sourced from the TSPLIB repository, and the CVRP instances are from the Augerat Benchmark. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **TSPLIB**:
  > Reinelt, G. (1991). TSPLIB: A traveling salesman problem library. *ORSA Journal on Computing*, 3(4), 376-384.

- For **Augerat Benchmark**:
  > Augerat, P., Belenguer, J. M., Benavent, E., Corber√°n, A., Naddef, D., & Rinaldi, G. (1995). Computational results with a branch and cut code for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. *Computational Optimization and Applications*, 34(3), 293-318.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
