To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black-box optimization with a politician" by SÃ©bastien Bubeck and Yin Tat Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the motivation and background, which may include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any mentions of specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention using datasets from **LIBSVM** for their binary classification problem. They refer to the datasets as being part of a collection used for empirical evaluation. I will note the specific datasets mentioned, such as "madelon," "rcv1," and "real-sim," as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the LIBSVM library, which is a well-known resource for support vector machine datasets. The citation for the LIBSVM library is:

- **LIBSVM**: 
  > Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. *Libsvm: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2(3):27, 2011. Software available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/cjlin/libsvm.

Additionally, I will ensure to note any specific papers or sources that describe the individual datasets if they are mentioned in the context of the experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
