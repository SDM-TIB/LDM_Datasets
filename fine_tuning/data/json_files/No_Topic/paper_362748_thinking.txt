To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Layer-Wise Analysis of Self-Supervised Speech Models" by Ankita Pasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research. In this case, the authors mention analyzing representations from various self-supervised speech models, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment Details)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention extracting representations from the **LibriSpeech** dataset, specifically the **dev-clean** set, which consists of 500 utterances (approximately 180,000 frames). This indicates that LibriSpeech is a key dataset for their analysis.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **SLURP** dataset for downstream tasks related to spoken language understanding. They mention using the **SLURP-action** and **SLURP-scenario** tasks, which implies that the SLURP dataset is also significant for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

2. For the **SLURP dataset**, the citation is:
   > E. Bastianelli, A. Vanzo, P. Swietojanski, and V. Rieser. *SLURP: A Spoken Language Understanding Resource Package*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
