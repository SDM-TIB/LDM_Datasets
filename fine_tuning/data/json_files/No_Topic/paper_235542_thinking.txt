To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consensus-Based Optimization on Hypersurfaces: Well-Posedness and Mean-Field Limit" by Massimo Fornasier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to look for detailed descriptions of datasets. This section typically contains information about the datasets used in the study, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used for simulations or theoretical analysis. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for testing their optimization methods, I will note the name and any details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "Ackley function" or any other specific dataset, I will ensure to find the original source or paper that introduced it. I will also look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might provide additional dataset information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
