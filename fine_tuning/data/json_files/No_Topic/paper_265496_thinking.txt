To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In silico tumor control induced via alternating immunostimulating and immunosuppressive phases" by A. I. Reppas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention any datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract discusses a mathematical model and its implications for tumor control, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **methodology** within the paper. This section typically outlines the data sources used for the research. If such a section is not present, I will check the **results** and **discussion** sections, as authors sometimes refer to datasets when discussing their findings.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference a few key datasets in the **methodology** section. They mention using experimental data from previous studies to parameterize their model. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **CT26 murine cells**: The authors cite experimental estimates for the growth rate of these cells, which are crucial for their model. However, they do not provide a formal dataset citation.

2. **Parameter values from previous studies**: The authors mention several studies that provided parameter values used in their model. These studies can be considered datasets for the purpose of this research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the referenced studies that provide the parameter values:

- For the CT26 murine cells, the relevant citation is:
  > H. Hatzikirou, J.C.L. Alfonso, S. Mühle, C. Stern, S. Weiss, and M. Meyer-Hermann. *Cancer therapeutic potential of combinatorial immuno- and vaso-modulatory interventions*. arXiv:1505.05670v1, 2015.

- For the parameter values, the authors reference:
  > A. d’Onofrio, U. Ledzewicz, and H. Schättler. *On the dynamics of tumor-immune system interactions and combined chemo- and immunotherapy*. In New Challenges for Cancer Systems Biomedicine, pp. 249–266, Springer Milan, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations. I will then prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
