To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Reality Gap for Pose Estimation Networks using Sensor-Based Domain Randomization" by Frederik Hagelskjær and Anders Glent Buch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the method is tested on "three large pose estimation benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss their method and its evaluation on various datasets. They mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Linemod (LM)** dataset and the **Occlusion (LMO)** dataset, which are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. The authors mention that their method is tested on the **Linemod (LM)** dataset and the **Occlusion (LMO)** dataset, confirming their use in the experiments. Additionally, they refer to the **BOP challenge** datasets, which include multiple datasets for benchmarking.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Linemod (LM)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Stefan Hinterstoisser, Vincent Lepetit, Slobodan Ilic, Stefan Holzer, Gary Bradski, Kurt Konolige, and Nassir Navab. *Model based training, detection and pose estimation of texture-less 3D objects in heavily cluttered scenes*. In Asian conference on computer vision, pages 548–562. Springer, 2012.

2. For the **Occlusion (LMO)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Eric Brachmann, Alexander Krull, Frank Michel, Stefan Gumhold, Jamie Shotton, and Carsten Rother. *Learning 6d object pose estimation using 3d object coordinates*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 536–551. Springer, 2014.

3. For the **BOP challenge**, the citation is:
   > Tomas Hodan, Frank Michel, Eric Brachmann, Wadim Kehl, Anders Glent Buch, Dirk Kraft, Bertram Drost, Joel Vidal, Stephan Ihrke, Xenophon Zabulis, et al. *BOP: Benchmark for 6D object pose estimation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 19–34, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
