To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning Based Multilingual Emoji Prediction in Clean and Attack Scenarios" by Karim Gamal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that emoji prediction data have been crawled from both Twitter and SemEval emoji datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors describe how they collected their data. They state that they used the Twitter API to crawl over 2 million tweets containing emojis and also utilized 500k training and test data from the SemEval dataset. This confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **Methodology** section, I will also note that the Twitter dataset encompasses three languages: Spanish, Italian, and French, while the SemEval dataset includes English. This detail is important for understanding the multilingual aspect of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SemEval dataset is referenced in the context of a shared task on multilingual emoji prediction, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the SemEval dataset is:
> Francesco Barbieri, Jose Camacho-Collados, Francesco Ronzano, Luis Espinosa-Anke, Miguel Ballesteros, Valerio Basile, Viviana Patti, and Horacio Saggion. *SemEval-2018 Task 2: Multilingual Emoji Prediction*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2018), New Orleans, LA, United States. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

For the Twitter dataset, since it is based on data crawled from the Twitter API, I will note that it does not have a formal citation like the SemEval dataset. However, I can describe it as follows:
> Twitter API data collected for emoji prediction, encompassing tweets in Spanish, Italian, and French.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations and descriptions as required. This structured approach will help me accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
