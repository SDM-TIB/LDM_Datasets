To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Deterministic Channel Model for mmWaves: Mathematical Formalization and Validation" by Mattia Lecci et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it discusses the importance of accurate channel models, it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In this paper, the authors mention comparing their model with real measurements at 60 GHz, which suggests that there are datasets involved in the validation of their model.

I will then look for any specific **sections dedicated to datasets**. In this case, the authors refer to a measurement campaign conducted in a lecture room, which implies that they have collected data from this environment. I will look for details about this measurement campaign, including the number of measurements, the setup, and any specific parameters that were recorded.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I find that the authors discuss the parameters and statistics derived from the measurements taken in NIST's Lecture Room. They mention that the data includes various material properties and channel characteristics, which are crucial for the QD model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a specific measurement campaign conducted by NIST, which is crucial for the validation of their model. The citation for this dataset is:

- For the NIST measurement campaign, the citation is:
  > C. Lai, R. Sun, C. Gentile, P. B. Papazian, J. Wang, and J. Senic. *Methodology for multipath-component tracking in millimeter-wave channel modeling*. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, vol. 67, no. 3, pp. 1826â€“1836, Mar. 2019.

Additionally, the authors reference other works that may contain relevant datasets or methodologies, but the primary dataset for their validation appears to be the one from the NIST measurement campaign.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
