To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal versions of Maximum Entropy and Principle of Insufficient Reason" by Dominik Janzing, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and any sections that detail experiments or methodologies, as these are likely to contain information about datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or results sections**. If the paper discusses experiments, it may describe the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will note down any datasets mentioned, ensuring to capture their names and descriptions accurately.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for the original papers or sources where the datasets were introduced or described.

If the paper does not provide full citations directly, I may need to conduct a brief search for the datasets online or in academic databases to ensure I can provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and relevant sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify and document the datasets, including their names and descriptions.
3. Check the references section for full citations of each dataset.
4. If necessary, conduct additional searches to find accurate citations.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, complete with proper citations.
