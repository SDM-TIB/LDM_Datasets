To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rapidly time-varying reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for downlink multiuser transmissions" by Francesco Verde et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets used in their research. If they mention any benchmarks or datasets, I will note them down.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experiments or simulations. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors present any data derived from the datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that reference the datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them with their full citations. For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references and include it in my notes.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for further processing or presentation.
