To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Analysis of Untargeted Poisoning Attack and Defense Methods for Federated Online Learning to Rank Systems" by Shuyi Wang and Guido Zuccon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction often contains specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) and mention that they will evaluate their methods on various datasets. However, I need to find the specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four commonly-used Learning to Rank (LTR) datasets:

1. **MQ2007**: This dataset consists of 1,700 queries, each associated with 46-dimensional feature vectors and 3-level relevance assessments (from not relevant (0) to very relevant (2)).
   
2. **MSLR-WEB10k**: This dataset contains 10,000 queries, with each query linked to an average of 125 documents, represented by 136 features.

3. **Yahoo**: This dataset includes 29,900 queries, with each query-document pair having 700 features.

4. **Istella-S**: The largest dataset in this study, it comprises 33,018 queries, 220 features, and an average of 103 documents per query.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **MQ2007**, the citation is:
  > Tao Qin and Tie-Yan Liu. 2013. Introducing LETOR 4.0 datasets. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.2597.

- For **MSLR-WEB10k**, the citation is:
  > Olivier Chapelle and Yi Chang. 2011. Yahoo! learning to rank challenge overview. In Proceedings of the learning to rank challenge. PMLR, 1–24.

- For **Yahoo**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the Yahoo learning to rank challenge.

- For **Istella-S**, the citation is:
  > Claudio Lucchese, Franco Maria Nardini, Salvatore Orlando, Raffaele Perego, Fabrizio Silvestri, and Salvatore Trani. 2016. Post-learning optimization of tree ensembles for efficient ranking. In Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval. 949–952.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
