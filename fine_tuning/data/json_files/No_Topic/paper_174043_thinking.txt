To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The E-Average Common Submatrix: Approximate Searching in a Restricted Neighborhood" by Alessia Amelio and Darko Brodić, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a new similarity measure for 2D arrays but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors mention that they expect the E-ACSM to perform well on "synthetic and real-world databases." This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names or references to these datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names in the experimental section, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that might include datasets. The references include works by the authors that may have used datasets relevant to their experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations that could potentially relate to datasets:

1. Amelio, A., Pizzuti, C. (2013). *Average Common Submatrix: A New Image Distance Measure*. In: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 170–180. This paper may contain datasets used for image distance measures.

2. Amelio, A. (2016). *Approximate matching in ACSM dissimilarity measure*. Procedia Computer Science, 96, 1479–1488. This paper might also reference datasets used in the context of dissimilarity measures.

3. Amelio, A., Pizzuti, C. (2016). *A patch-based measure for image dissimilarity*. Neurocomputing, 171, 362–378. This could include datasets related to image dissimilarity.

4. Crochemore, M., Gasieniec, L., Rytter, W., Plandowski, W. (1995). *Two-dimensional pattern matching in linear time and small space*. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 181–192. This reference may not directly relate to datasets but could provide context for the methods used.

5. Ziv, J. (2011). *An axiomatic approach to the notion of similarity of individual sequences and their classification*. In: First Int. Conf. on Data Compr., Comm. and Proc. pp. 3–7. This reference is more theoretical and may not include datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will note that the authors plan to experiment with E-ACSM in three domains: images, digitized documents, and 2D data representations generated by sensors. However, without specific dataset names provided in the paper or references, I cannot extract any dataset entries.

In conclusion, while I have identified potential references that may contain datasets, the paper itself does not provide explicit dataset names or details. Therefore, I will summarize my findings without creating dataset entries, as there are no specific datasets to cite from this paper.
