To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASIF: Coupled Data Turns Unimodal Models to Multimodal without Training" by Antonio Norelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the ASIF model and its efficiency in using a smaller collection of image-text pairs, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Empirical Evidence)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Conceptual Caption dataset (CC12M)**, which consists of 1.6 million image-text pairs collected from the internet. This dataset is crucial for the ASIF model's performance.

In addition, I will check the **appendix** for any additional details or datasets that may not have been fully elaborated in the main sections. The appendix confirms that the authors used the **CC12M dataset** for their experiments, providing further context on its significance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Conceptual Caption dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Soravit Changpinyo, Piyush Sharma, Nan Ding, and Radu Soricut. *Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. In CVPR, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring it is structured clearly and accurately reflects the information extracted from the paper.
