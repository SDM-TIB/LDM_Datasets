To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of an Algorithm for Identifying Changes in System Dynamics from Time Series" by Ferdaus Kawsar and Mohammad Adibuzzaman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **background and approach sections**. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will pay particular attention to any mention of empirical data, including the source of the data and the context in which it was collected.

In the **approach section**, the authors mention that the time series data used for their algorithm is the arterial blood pressure of swine undergoing hemorrhage. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **acknowledgment and references sections** for any additional datasets or sources that may not have been explicitly mentioned in the main text. The acknowledgment section may provide insights into collaborations or data sources, while the references section can help me find full citations for any datasets mentioned.

From my reading, I identify the following dataset:

1. **Arterial Blood Pressure Data from Swine**: This dataset is collected from pigs undergoing hemorrhage, and it is crucial for the empirical analysis presented in the paper. The authors state that the data was obtained from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Now, I will look for the full citation for this dataset. Since it is derived from a specific study or institutional source, I will reference the relevant paper or report that describes the dataset in detail. 

The citation for the dataset is:
> Adibuzzaman, M., & Kramer, G. C. (2014). The mixing rate of the arterial blood pressure waveform Markov chain is correlated with shock index during hemorrhage in anesthetized swine. In *36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)*, Chicago, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
