To extract datasets from the research paper titled "hmBERT: Historical Multilingual Language Models for Named Entity Recognition" by Stefan Schweter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions the challenges of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in historical texts and hints at the use of various datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (hmBERT: Historical Multilingual BERT Model)**, where the authors describe the corpora used for training the hmBERT model. Here, they specify that they utilize the **Europeana newspapers** for German, French, Swedish, and Finnish, and a dataset from the **British Library** for English. This section provides crucial information about the datasets.

In **subsection 2.1 (Corpora)**, the authors detail the specific datasets used for each language:
1. **Europeana Newspapers**: This dataset is used for German, French, Swedish, and Finnish. It contains OCR-processed historical texts.
2. **British Library Dataset**: This dataset contains OCR-processed text from digitized books for English.

Additionally, I will check **Table 1** in the paper, which lists the NER datasets used for calculating subword fertility rates. The datasets mentioned are:
- **CLEF-HIPE-2020** for German, French, and Finnish.
- **NewsEye** for all languages.

In **section 3 (HIPE-2022: Multilingual Classical Commentary Challenge)**, the authors describe the **ajmc dataset**, which is used for the HIPE-2022 shared task. This dataset includes excerpts from commentaries published in the 19th century in English, French, and German.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

After gathering all this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
