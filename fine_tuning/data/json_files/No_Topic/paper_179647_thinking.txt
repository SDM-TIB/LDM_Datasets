To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Robustness of Kernel Clustering" by Bowei Yan and Purnamrita Sarkar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract typically summarizes the main contributions of the paper, and the introduction often provides context and references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology and experiments, as these sections usually detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned.

If the paper includes a **results** or **experiments** section, I will examine it closely to see if the authors provide any quantitative results based on specific datasets. This can help confirm the datasets used and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "Penn Action Dataset" and "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will look for their respective citations in the references. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, which can be useful for future research or replication studies.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Check the results section for quantitative evaluations based on datasets.
4. Refer to the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information with descriptions and citations for clarity and completeness.
