To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Structure Learning for Better Generalization and Causal Explainability" by Yunhao Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on various synthetic and real-world datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors discuss their experiments in both supervised and self-supervised learning settings. They mention using synthetic datasets with known causal structures and real-world datasets, specifically the **Boston Housing** and **Insurance** datasets.

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe the creation of synthetic datasets in detail, but they do not provide specific citations for these datasets since they are generated for the purpose of the study. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are synthetic and created based on specific methodologies outlined in the paper.

2. **Boston Housing Dataset**: The authors use this dataset to predict the median value of homes (MED). The citation for this dataset is:
   > [1] http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston.

3. **Insurance Dataset**: This dataset is used for car insurance risk estimation and includes various attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > [2] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007421730016.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document their full citations accurately. The synthetic datasets do not have a formal citation since they are generated for the study, but I will note their significance in the context of the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the synthetic datasets and the real-world datasets with their citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
