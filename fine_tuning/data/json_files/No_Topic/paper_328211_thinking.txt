To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel Blood Pressure Waveform Reconstruction from Photoplethysmography using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks" by Milad Asgari Mehrabadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for reconstructing blood pressure signals from PPG signals, which suggests that a dataset is likely used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Material and Methods)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they employed the **MIMIC-II online waveform database**, which contains various bio-signals, including PPG and corresponding ABP signals. This section provides details about the dataset, such as the number of subjects and the sampling frequency.

The authors describe that they used recordings from **92 subjects** and performed **5-fold cross-validation**. This confirms the dataset's relevance and its application in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-II dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **MIMIC-II online waveform database**:
  > A. L. Goldberger et al., “Physiobank, physiotoolkit, and physionet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals,” *Circulation*, vol. 101, no. 23, pp. e215–e220, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
