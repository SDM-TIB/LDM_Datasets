To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Financial Contagion and Asset Liquidation Strategies" by Zachary Feinstein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the analysis. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets that are foundational to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or methodology**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which they were used.

If the paper discusses any datasets in the **results or discussion sections**, I will also take note of those mentions, as they may provide additional context or validation for the datasets identified earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Financial Network Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will ensure to cite the original source accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper.
