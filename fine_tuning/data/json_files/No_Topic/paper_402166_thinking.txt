To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online POMDP Planning with Anytime Deterministic Guarantees" by Moran Barenboim and Vadim Indelman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of planning under uncertainty and mention various algorithms but do not explicitly name any datasets. I will then proceed to the **methods section** where they describe their algorithm and its integration with existing solvers. Here, I will look for any mention of datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention evaluating their algorithms on several POMDPs, including the **Tiger POMDP**, **Discrete Light Dark**, and **Baby POMDP**. I will note these datasets as they are directly related to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the original sources or papers where these datasets were introduced or described. 

1. For the **Tiger POMDP**, the citation is:
   > Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Michael L. Littman, and Anthony R. Cassandra. *Planning and acting in partially observable stochastic domains*. Artificial Intelligence, 101(1):99â€“134, 1998.

2. For the **Discrete Light Dark POMDP**, the citation is:
   > Zachary Sunberg and Mykel Kochenderfer. *Online algorithms for pomdps with continuous state, action, and observation spaces*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, volume 28, 2018.

3. For the **Baby POMDP**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it may require further investigation to find the original source or details.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which can be useful for future research or validation purposes.
