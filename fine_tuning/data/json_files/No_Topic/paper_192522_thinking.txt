To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heuristics for Exact Nonnegative Matrix Factorization" by Arnaud Vandaele et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Benchmark Nonnegative Matrices for Exact NMF)**, where the authors list various classes of nonnegative matrices used for benchmarking their algorithms. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets.

In this section, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Linear Euclidean Distance Matrices (LEDM)**: The paper describes several LEDM datasets of varying sizes (e.g., LEDM6, LEDM8, LEDM12, etc.) and their characteristics.

2. **Slack Matrices**: The authors mention slack matrices for various polygons, including the hexagon, heptagon, octagon, and others. Each of these matrices is defined in terms of their dimensions and properties.

3. **Unique-Disjointness Matrices (UDISJ)**: The paper discusses UDISJ matrices for different values of n (e.g., UDISJ4, UDISJ5, UDISJ6), which are also relevant datasets.

4. **Randomly Generated Matrices**: The authors describe how they generated random matrices with specific properties, including density parameters.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This may involve looking for original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, the citation for the **Linear Euclidean Distance Matrices** might be derived from foundational work in the field, while the **slack matrices** may reference specific geometric studies.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
