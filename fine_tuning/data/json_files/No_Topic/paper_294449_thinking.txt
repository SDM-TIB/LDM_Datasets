To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Portable Smart Surveillance System for Theft Detection" by Atharva Karnik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and its components, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets or data sources. The introduction discusses the context of theft detection systems and mentions various technologies but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any experimental data or datasets used in the development or testing of the system. The authors describe the components of their system, such as the GY-521 sensor and the ESP8266 microcontroller, but they do not reference any datasets.

In the **literature survey**, the authors cite previous works that may have used datasets, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. The references to other papers do not provide direct access to datasets either.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might lead to datasets. The references include various papers and sources, but they primarily focus on the technologies and methodologies rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will still compile the references for the technologies mentioned in the paper, as they may lead to datasets in future research.

Now, I will create a list of the references cited in the paper, ensuring to format them correctly for any potential future use.

By following this structured approach, I have ensured that I thoroughly searched for datasets and documented the relevant references, even though no specific datasets were identified in the paper.
