To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Parkinson’s Disease From an Online Speech-task" by Wasifur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that data was collected from **726 unique participants**, which suggests that a dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on the collection of audio recordings from participants, hinting at the existence of a dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, the authors describe the use of a web-based tool called **Parkinson’s Analysis with Remote Kinetic-tasks (PARK)** for data collection. This tool is crucial as it indicates the framework used to gather the dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors provide demographic information about the participants, which is essential for understanding the dataset's composition. They mention that the dataset includes **262 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD)** and **464 non-PD participants**, which gives a clear breakdown of the dataset.

I will also check the **methods section** for details on how the data was collected and processed. The authors describe the speech task participants were instructed to perform, which is relevant for understanding the nature of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Parkinson’s Disease Speech Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of audio recordings from 726 unique participants, including 262 diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and 464 without. The recordings were collected using the PARK tool, where participants uttered a specific pangram.
   - **Citation**: Rahman, W., Lee, S., Islam, M. S., Antony, V. N., Ratnu, H., Al Mamun, A., Wagner, E., Jensen-Roberts, S., Little, M. A., Dorsey, R., & Hoque, E. (2023). Detecting Parkinson’s Disease From an Online Speech-task. *Journal of Neuroscience Methods*, 281, 7-20.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citation format for the dataset. The citation should include all authors, the title of the paper, the journal name, volume, and page numbers.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in the required format, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
