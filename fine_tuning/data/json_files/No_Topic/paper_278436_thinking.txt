To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Energy Management of HVAC via Transactive Energy" by Qing Yang and Hao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a distributed energy trading algorithm using real-world data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors mention that they validate their algorithm using "real-world data" of renewable generation and load data. They specifically state that the simulation data includes users' daily electricity usage, renewable energy generation, and outdoor temperature during a specific time period (September 6-12, 2016). This indicates that there are datasets used for the simulations.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites two sources for the data used in the simulations:

1. For the renewable generation data, the citation is:
   > H. Wang, “Microgrid generation planning considering renewable energy target,” in 2016 IEEE International Conference on Power and Energy (PECon). IEEE, 2016, pp. 356–360.

2. For the load data, the citation is:
   > Energy Research, Website, Pecan Street Inc., accessed on 1 Oct. 2019. [Online]. Available: https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Real-world data of renewable generation** (H. Wang, 2016)
- **Real-world data of load** (Pecan Street Inc., 2019)

I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and include the necessary citations for future reference or use.
