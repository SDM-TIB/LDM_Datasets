To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Depth Enhanced Direct Thermal-infrared SLAM" by Young-Sik Shin and Ayoung Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collections used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments with a thermal-infrared camera and LiDAR, and they refer to a dataset consisting of **14 sequences** collected during outdoor and subterranean experiments. I will note the details of this dataset, including the context in which it was collected.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The authors may reference other works that describe the datasets they used or compared against. This is crucial for providing full citations.

From the paper, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Thermal-LiDAR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14 sequences collected in various environments, including outdoor and subterranean settings. The authors mention that the total traversed distance is 8.8 km, and the dataset includes data collected during both day and night.

2. **VRS-GPS Data**: The authors used VRS-GPS data as ground truth for evaluating their method. This data is crucial for comparing the accuracy of their SLAM system.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Thermal-LiDAR Dataset**, since it is a novel dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Young-Sik Shin and Ayoung Kim. *Thermal-LiDAR Dataset for Sparse Depth Enhanced Direct Thermal-infrared SLAM*. Dataset available at [insert URL if available].

- For the **VRS-GPS Data**, I will look for the original source or reference that describes this dataset. If it is a standard dataset used in the field, I will provide the citation accordingly. If not explicitly mentioned, I will note it as:
  > VRS-GPS data used for ground truth comparison. [Insert citation if available].

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or citations in the paper.
