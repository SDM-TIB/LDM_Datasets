To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Resilience in Cambodia Using Microfinance Data" by Rajius Idzalika, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "nearly 1.2 million microfinance institution (MFI) customer data," which indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to gather more details.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3), where the author describes the dataset in detail. The paper states that the data is generated from an anonymous MFI in Cambodia and is longitudinal, covering the years 2012 to 2015. It specifies that the dataset includes financial features such as annual loan balance, interest rate, loan term, and currency types. The total number of observations is approximately 1.2 million, which is significant.

I will also check the **acknowledgements and references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The acknowledgements mention a partnership with the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) and access to the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2014 and Finscope 2015, which could be relevant datasets for validation purposes.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Microfinance Institution (MFI) Customer Data**: This dataset is the primary focus of the study, consisting of nearly 1.2 million records from an anonymous MFI in Cambodia, covering financial features and customer information from 2012 to 2015.

2. **Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2014**: This dataset is used for validation against the adaptive capacity index. It provides demographic and health-related data relevant to the study.

3. **Finscope 2015**: Another dataset used for validation, offering insights into financial behaviors and characteristics of the population.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2014**, the citation is:
  > ICF International. *Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014*. Phnom Penh, Cambodia: National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning, 2015.

- For the **Finscope 2015**, the citation is:
  > FinMark Trust. *Finscope Cambodia 2015*. 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
