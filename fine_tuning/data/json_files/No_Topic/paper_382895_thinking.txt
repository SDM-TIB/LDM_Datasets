To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MULTI-TEMPORAL LIP-AUDIO MEMORY FOR VISUAL SPEECH RECOGNITION" by Jeong Hun Yeo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on two public VSR datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They refer to two datasets: **LRW** and **LRW-1000**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets from this section.

1. **LRW (Lip Reading in the Wild)**: This dataset is described as an English word-level VSR dataset containing 500 words, with 800 to 1,000 video clips per class. Each video clip has 29 frames and a duration of approximately 1.16 seconds. The authors also mention preprocessing steps, such as cropping the video to focus on lip movement.

2. **LRW-1000**: This dataset is a Mandarin word-level VSR dataset containing 1,000 words and a total of 718,808 video clips. The video clips are already cropped, and the authors resize them to 96×96 pixels. They also adjust the duration of the video clips to ensure time alignment with the audio.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **LRW**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip reading in the wild*. In Asian conference on computer vision. Springer, 2016, pp. 87–103.

- For **LRW-1000**, the citation is:
  > Shuang Yang, Yuanhang Zhang, Dalu Feng, Mingmin Yang, Chenhao Wang, Jingyun Xiao, Keyu Long, Shiguang Shan, and Xilin Chen. *Lrw-1000: A naturally-distributed large-scale benchmark for lip reading in the wild*. In 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2019). IEEE, 2019, pp. 1–8.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
