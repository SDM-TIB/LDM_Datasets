To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilient Constrained Consensus over Complete Graphs via Feasibility Redundancy" by Jingxuan Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract discusses a resilient high-dimensional constrained consensus problem but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in experiments or simulations. The introduction primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of the problem and references previous works but does not specify any datasets.

I will then check the **results and analysis sections** for any empirical evaluations that might involve datasets. However, the paper seems to focus on theoretical results rather than empirical experiments with datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or simulations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

Finally, I will review the **references section** to ensure that I have not missed any potential datasets that might be cited in the context of previous works. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not indicate any datasets.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I find that it does not contain any datasets to extract or cite. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper.
