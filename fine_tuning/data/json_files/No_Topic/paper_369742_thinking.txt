To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRYPTEXT: Database and Interactive Toolkit of Human-Written Text Perturbations in the Wild" by Thai Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the CRYPTEXT system, but I need to look for specific datasets that are utilized or referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for a tool to analyze human-written perturbations. They mention that the database relies on a collection of tokens from several public datasets, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their names.

In the **methodology section**, particularly under the **Human-Written Token Database**, the authors state that the database is curated from several public datasets originally designed for detecting abusive materials online. However, they do not explicitly name these datasets in this section. I will need to look further into the **literature review** and **references** to find specific datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The authors reference several works that may include datasets relevant to their research. 

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **Rumor Detection Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of abusive material detection. The citation is:
   > E. Kochkina, M. Liakata, and A. Zubiaga. *All-in-one: Multi-task learning for rumour verification*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2018.

2. **Hate Speech Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in relation to detecting abusive content. The citation is:
   > R. Gomez, J. Gibert, L. Gomez, and D. Karatzas. *Exploring hate speech detection in multimodal publications*. In Proceedings of the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020.

3. **Wikipedia Talk Labels Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for personal attacks in online discussions. The citation is:
   > E. Wulczyn, N. Thain, and L. Dixon. *Wikipedia talk labels: Personal attacks*. February 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
