To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cross-Season Correspondence Dataset for Robust Semantic Segmentation" by MËšans Larsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two cross-season correspondence datasets are created, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more context about these datasets. The introduction discusses the need for datasets that can handle variations in seasonal and weather conditions, confirming that the datasets are crucial for the research.

I will then focus on **section 4 (A Cross-Season Correspondence Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. This section is likely to provide the specific names and characteristics of the datasets. 

Within this section, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **CMU Seasons Correspondence Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the CMU Visual Localization dataset and includes images taken over 12 months in Pittsburgh, USA. It provides 2D-2D matches across different seasons and weather conditions.

2. **Oxford RobotCar Correspondence Dataset**: This dataset is based on the RobotCar dataset, which was collected over 12 months in Oxford, UK. It also includes 2D-2D matches under varying conditions.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **CMU Seasons Correspondence Dataset**:
  > T. Sattler, W. Maddern, C. Toft, A. Torii, L. Hammarstrand, E. Stenborg, D. Safari, M. Okutomi, M. Pollefeys, J. Sivic, F. Kahl, and T. Pajdla. *Benchmarking 6dof outdoor visual localization in changing conditions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For the **RobotCar Seasons Dataset**:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the original authors.
