To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Threshold Tests for Detecting Discrimination" by Emma Pierson, Sam Corbett-Davies, and Sharad Goel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions analyzing "2.7 million police stops of pedestrians in New York City," which indicates a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Stop-and-Frisk Case Study)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their analysis. They specify that the dataset contains information on "2.7 million police stops occurring between 2008 and 2012," including various variables such as the race of the pedestrian, the police precinct, whether the pedestrian was frisked, and whether a weapon was found. This section confirms the dataset's relevance to their study.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure that I capture any additional datasets or relevant citations. The references section may provide full citations for any datasets mentioned, particularly if they are derived from other studies or publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **New York City Police Stops Dataset**: This dataset includes 2.7 million records of police stops from 2008 to 2012, detailing the race of the pedestrian, the precinct of the stop, whether a frisk was conducted, and whether a weapon was found.

Next, I will look for the full citation for this dataset. The authors reference a related study by Pierson et al. (2017), which is likely the source of the dataset. I will retrieve the citation from the references section:

- For the **New York City Police Stops Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emma Pierson, Christopher Simoiu, J. Overgoor, Sam Corbett-Davies, V. Ramachandran, C. Phillips, and Sharad Goel. *A large-scale analysis of racial disparities in police stops across the United States*. Working paper, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation for further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
