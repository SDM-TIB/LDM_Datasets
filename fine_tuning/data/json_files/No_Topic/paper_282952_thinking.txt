To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Local Binary Pattern Based Blind Feature Image Steganography" by Soumendu Chakraborty and Anand Singh Jalal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and mentions that the performance of the steganography technique has been tested on several images of different types. This suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to look for specific names or references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their method on images from the **USC-SIPI database**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then look for any specific details about the USC-SIPI database in the **performance analysis** section, where the authors discuss the robustness of their method using various images from this database. They mention that they used **206 different types of images** from the USC-SIPI database as payloads for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the USC-SIPI database. The citation is typically formatted in a standard way, and I will ensure to capture it accurately. The reference for the USC-SIPI database is:

> USC-SIPI: http://sipi.usc.edu/database/

Since the database is referenced as a website rather than a traditional publication, I will note that it is an online resource.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the USC-SIPI database. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may wish to access the dataset for their own research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
