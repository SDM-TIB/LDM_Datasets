To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Auto Weight: Entirely Data-driven and Highly Efficient Weighting Framework" by Zhenmao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework is evaluated on **CIFAR and ImageNet datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. They explicitly mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 validation color images of 32x32 resolution with 10 classes. The authors note that they use a part of the training dataset (20,000 for training and 5,000 for validation) for searching the weighting strategy.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training and 10,000 validation images but with 100 classes. The same sampling strategy is applied as with CIFAR-10.

3. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. The authors sample a small part of the training dataset (100,000 images) for searching the weighting strategy.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, Citeseer.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 248â€“255). IEEE.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing.
