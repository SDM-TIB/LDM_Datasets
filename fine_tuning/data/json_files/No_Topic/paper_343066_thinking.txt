To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-task Learning for Gaussian Graphical Regressions with High Dimensional Covariates" by Jingfei Zhang and Yi Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to a gene co-expression network study with brain cancer patients, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their application to a specific dataset derived from the REMBRANDT trial (GSE108476), which includes gene expression and SNP data from glioblastoma patients. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for simulations or comparisons. The paper mentions that they simulated data for their experiments, but the focus is primarily on the REMBRANDT dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the REMBRANDT dataset, the citation is:
> Gusev, Y., Bhuvaneshwar, K., Song, L., Zenklusen, J.-C., Fine, H., and Madhavan, S. (2018). “The REMBRANDT study, a large collection of genomic data from brain cancer patients.” *Scientific Data*, 5, 180158.

Next, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **REMBRANDT Dataset**: This dataset includes gene expression and SNP data from 178 glioblastoma multiforme patients, which is crucial for the study of gene co-expression networks in the context of brain cancer.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
