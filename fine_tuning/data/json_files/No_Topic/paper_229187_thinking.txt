To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of a hand pose recognition system on an embedded computer using CNNs" by Dennis Núñez Fernández, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the work involves hand pose recognition, which suggests that there may be datasets related to hand gestures.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of hand gesture recognition and mentions the need for sufficiently large datasets. However, no specific datasets are named yet.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the author describes the system's implementation. Here, I find a crucial piece of information: the dataset for hand gesture classification is taken from AGH University of Science and Technology. The author specifies that this dataset contains **73,124 grayscale images of 48x48 pixels divided into 10 hand gestures**. This is a clear identification of a dataset.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details or confirmations about the dataset used. However, the results primarily focus on the performance metrics of the proposed CNN and do not introduce any new datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset from AGH University of Science and Technology, the citation is:
  > Dennis Núñez Fernández and Bogdan Kwolek. *Hand posture recognition using convolutional neural network*. In Marcelo Mendoza and Sergio Velastín, editors, Progress in Pattern Recognition, Image Analysis, Computer Vision, and Applications, pages 441–449, Cham, 2018. Springer International Publishing.

Since this citation pertains to the work of the author and the dataset is derived from their research, it serves as the authoritative reference for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its description and citation, into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
