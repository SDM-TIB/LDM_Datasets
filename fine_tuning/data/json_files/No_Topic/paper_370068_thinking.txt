To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interval Reachability of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Neural Network Controllers" by Saber Jafarpour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments or case studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the case studies. This section typically contains specific information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any **case studies** mentioned, as they often involve specific datasets. For instance, the authors may describe the datasets used for the numerical experiments on the nonlinear vehicle model and the linear quadrotor model.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the authors and the year of the original dataset publication to construct a proper citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
