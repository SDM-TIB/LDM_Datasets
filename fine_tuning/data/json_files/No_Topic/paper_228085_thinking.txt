To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining image classifiers by removing input features using generative models" by Chirag Agarwal and Anh Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their approach on **two large-scale datasets: ImageNet and Places365**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Datasets and Networks)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. They describe:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 50,000 validation images, which is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **Places365**: Another large dataset containing 36,500 validation images, specifically designed for scene recognition.

Both datasets are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper, as they are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252, 2015.

- For **Places365**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., Torralba, A. *Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6), 1452-1464, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 50,000 validation images used for image classification.
   - Citation: Russakovsky, O., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

2. **Places365**: A dataset containing 36,500 validation images for scene recognition.
   - Citation: Zhou, B., et al. (2017). *Places: A 10 Million Image Database for Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6), 1452-1464.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
