To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementing a GPU-based parallel MAX-MIN Ant System" by Rafa≈Ç Skinderowicz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the author often discusses the context of the research and may mention specific datasets relevant to the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the experimental setup, including any datasets employed for testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any specific names, characteristics, or sources of the datasets.

The **experimental results section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the author discusses the performance of the proposed method on specific datasets. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize results based on different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets used may include instances from the TSPLIB repository, as the author mentions solving TSP instances. I will ensure to document the full citation for TSPLIB and any other datasets mentioned.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
