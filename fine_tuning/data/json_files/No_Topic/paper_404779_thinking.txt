To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "TwinPot: Digital Twin-assisted Honeypot for Cyber-Secure Smart Seaports" by Yagmur Yigit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and performance evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built an extensive smart seaport dataset for internal and external attacks, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **performance evaluation section** where the authors describe the datasets used for testing their proposed solution. Here, they mention using the **MANSIM tool** to generate a dataset for internal attacks and two existing datasets for external attacks:

1. **Edge-IIoTset Dataset**: This dataset includes fourteen attacks on connectivity protocols and is specifically designed for IoT and IIoT applications. The authors state that they used this dataset as internal traffic for their system.

2. **SDSN Dataset**: This dataset contains nine different DDoS UDP attack datasets created from heterogeneous traffic speed and variable traffic payload criteria. The authors used this dataset for external traffic.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Edge-IIoTset Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. A. Ferrag, O. Friha, D. Hamouda, L. Maglaras, and H. Janicke. *Edge-IIoTset: A New Comprehensive Realistic Cyber Security Dataset of IoT and IIoT Applications for Centralized and Federated Learning*. IEEE Access, vol. 10, pp. 40 281–40 306, 2022.

- For the **SDSN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Horsanali, Y. Yigit, G. Secinti, A. Karameseoglu, and B. Canberk. *Network-Aware AutoML Framework for Software-Defined Sensor Networks*. In 2021 17th International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS), 2021, pp. 451–457.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **MANSIM tool** to generate maritime data, which is also relevant. The citation for the MANSIM tool is:
  > O. F. Sukas, O. K. Kinaci, and S. Bal. *Theoretical background and application of mansim for ship maneuvering simulations*. Ocean Engineering, vol. 192, p. 106239, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
