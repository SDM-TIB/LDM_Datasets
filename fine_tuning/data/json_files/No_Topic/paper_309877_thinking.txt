To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bursting Scientific Filter Bubbles: Boosting Innovation via Novel Author Discovery" by Jason Portenoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for analysis or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section often includes details about the datasets used, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to data sources.

In this paper, the authors mention using data from the **Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)**, which is a significant dataset for their research. I will note this as it is a primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any other datasets referenced or if the authors discuss any additional data collection methods that might involve other datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **Microsoft Academic Graph**, I will look for the appropriate citation that describes this dataset in detail.

The citation for the Microsoft Academic Graph is:
> Arnab Sinha, Zhihong Shen, Yang Song, Hao Ma, Darrin Eide, Bo-June (Paul) Hsu, and Kuansan Wang. *An Overview of Microsoft Academic Service (MAS) and Applications*. In Proceedings of the 12th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), pages 243â€“246, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1145/2740908.2742839

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
