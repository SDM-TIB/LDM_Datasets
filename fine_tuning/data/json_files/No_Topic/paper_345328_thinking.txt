To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two Ways of Understanding Social Dynamics: Analyzing the Predictability of Emergence of Objects in Reddit r/place Dependent on Locality in Space and Time" by Alyssa M. Adams et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a dataset related to the r/place experiment on Reddit, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the r/place experiment in detail. They mention that the dataset includes pixel placements from 2017-03-21 21:03:09 UTC to 2017-04-03 16:58:55 UTC, which provides a time frame for the dataset.

In the **methods section**, the authors discuss their analysis of the r/place dataset, indicating that they rendered snapshots of the canvas at 10-minute intervals, resulting in a total of 682 snapshots. This suggests that the dataset is not only about pixel placements but also about the temporal evolution of the canvas.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original dataset source as follows:

- For the r/place dataset, the citation is:
  > u/Drunken Economist. *Place Datasets (April Fools 2017)*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdata/comments/6640ru/. Accessed: 2022-03-03.

Additionally, they reference a project that analyzed the canvas:
- For the r/place Atlas project, the citation is:
  > Rytz, R. *The/r/place Atlas*. Available at: https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/. Accessed: 2022-03-03.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the key datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **r/place Dataset**: Contains pixel placements from the collaborative social experiment on Reddit, spanning from March 21, 2017, to April 3, 2017.
   - Citation: u/Drunken Economist. *Place Datasets (April Fools 2017)*. Available at: https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdata/comments/6640ru/. Accessed: 2022-03-03.

2. **r/place Atlas Dataset**: Analyzed the final state of the canvas and identified various objects and phenomena.
   - Citation: Rytz, R. *The/r/place Atlas*. Available at: https://draemm.li/various/place-atlas/. Accessed: 2022-03-03.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
