To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A first econometric analysis of the CRIX family" by Shi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the CRIX index family, which is constructed based on approximately 30 cryptocurrencies. This indicates that there may be a dataset related to these cryptocurrencies.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (A first econometric analysis of the CRIX family)**, where the authors describe the CRIX index and its construction. They mention that the CRIX index is based on approximately 30 cryptocurrencies, and I will look for a table or list that details these cryptocurrencies.

In **Table 1.1**, the authors list the 30 cryptocurrencies used in the construction of the CRIX index, including their symbols and descriptions. This table is crucial as it provides the specific cryptocurrencies that make up the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the CRIX dataset itself, but it does reference the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 649, which provides access to the dataset. Therefore, I will note this as the source of the dataset.

The relevant dataset and its citation can be summarized as follows:

1. **CRIX Dataset**: This dataset includes the CRIX index constructed from approximately 30 cryptocurrencies. The dataset is accessible through the Collaborative Research Center (CRC) 649.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
