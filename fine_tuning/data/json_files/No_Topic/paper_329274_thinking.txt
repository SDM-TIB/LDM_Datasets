To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The slurk Interaction Server Framework: Better Data for Better Dialog Models" by Jana Göttze et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the slurk software's capabilities for dialog data collection, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors mention the need for dialog data but do not name specific datasets. I will continue to the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of existing frameworks.

In the **related work section**, the authors discuss several frameworks and tools but do not provide specific dataset names. However, they mention the use of the slurk tool in previous research, which may lead to datasets used in those studies.

Moving on to **section 5 (Studying dialog with slurk)**, I will look for any examples of data collections or experiments that might reference specific datasets. Here, the authors mention using the slurk tool for various dialog tasks, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** for any citations that might point to datasets. In the references, I find several papers cited, but I need to determine if any of these papers introduce datasets relevant to the slurk framework.

After reviewing the references, I identify a few papers that may contain datasets:

1. **CLEVR Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., and Girshick, R. (2017). *CLEVR: A Diagnostic Dataset for Compositional Language and Elementary Visual Reasoning*. In 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1988–1997, Honolulu, HI, July. IEEE.

2. **MeetUp! Corpus**:
   - Citation: Ilinykh, N., Zarrieß, S., and Schlangen, D. (2019). *MeetUp! A Corpus of Joint Activity Dialogues in a Visual Environment*. In Proceedings of the 23rd Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue (SemDial 2019 / LondonLogue), London, UK.

3. **SWITCHBOARD Corpus**:
   - Citation: Godfrey, J. J., Holliman, E. C., and McDaniel, J. (1992). *SWITCHBOARD: Telephone speech corpus for research and development*. In Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, IEEE International Conference On, pages 517–520. IEEE Computer Society, March.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be documented with its citation to ensure proper attribution.
