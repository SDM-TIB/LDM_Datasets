To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence Intervals for Testing Disparate Impact in Fair Learning" by Philippe Besseb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide accurate citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on confidence intervals and disparate impact, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Using Confidence Intervals for Real Dataset)**, where the authors discuss specific datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset contains 29,825 instances with 14 attributes, used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year. The authors highlight the importance of this dataset in assessing disparate impact concerning protected attributes like sex and origin.

2. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its potential to exhibit discrimination based on origin when assessing creditworthiness. The authors provide a disparate impact score for this dataset, indicating its relevance in the study of fairness in machine learning.

3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset includes information on 7,214 offenders and is used to predict recidivism. The authors discuss the implications of using this dataset in the context of racial discrimination, making it a critical part of their analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. J. L. (1996). *Adult Income Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- For the **German Credit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hofmann, M., & Klinkenberg, R. (2015). *German Credit Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

- For the **COMPAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dieterich, W., Mendoza, C., & Brennan, T. (2016). *Compas Risk Scales: Demonstrating Accuracy Equity and Predictive Parity*. Northpoint Inc. Available at: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
