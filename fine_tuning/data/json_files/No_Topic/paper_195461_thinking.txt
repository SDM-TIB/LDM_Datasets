To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Natural Gradient for Deep Networks" by Razvan Pascanu and Yoshua Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of experiments, such as the Toronto Face Dataset (TFD) mentioned in the experiments section. The authors discuss using TFD for evaluating their method, which indicates it is a dataset of interest.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the Toronto Face Dataset, I will look for the citation provided in the references, which is:

- **Toronto Face Dataset**: 
  > Susskind, J., Anderson, A., & Hinton, G. E. (2010). *The Toronto face dataset*. Technical Report UTML TR 2010-001, U. Toronto.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have all the necessary details to create a structured output. This includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
