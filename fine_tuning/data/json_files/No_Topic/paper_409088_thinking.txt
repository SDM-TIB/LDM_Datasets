To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GSAP-NER: A Novel Task, Corpus, and Baseline for Scholarly Entity Extraction Focused on Machine Learning Models and Datasets" by Wolfgang Otto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it mentions the release of a corpus for named entity recognition (NER) focused on machine learning models and datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They introduce the GSAP-NER dataset, which consists of 100 manually annotated full-text scientific publications with over 54,000 entity mentions. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset, including its purpose and structure.

In this section, the authors also mention the **annotation tag set**, which categorizes entities into MLModel related, Dataset related, and miscellaneous types. This indicates that the dataset is specifically designed to capture mentions of machine learning models and datasets, which is crucial for my extraction.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference other datasets in comparison to GSAP-NER, such as SciERC and SciREX, which may also be relevant.

The citations I need to extract include:

1. **GSAP-NER Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for their own dataset, but I can reference the paper itself:
   > Wolfgang Otto, Matthäus Zloch, Lu Gan, Saurav Karmakar, and Stefan Dietze. *GSAP-NER: A Novel Task, Corpus, and Baseline for Scholarly Entity Extraction Focused on Machine Learning Models and Datasets*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2023.

2. **SciERC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yi Luan, Luheng He, Mari Ostendorf, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Multi-task identification of entities, relations, and coreference for scientific knowledge graph construction*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3219–3232, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **SciREX Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Sarthak Jain, Madeleine van Zuylen, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, and Iz Beltagy. *SciREX: A challenge dataset for document-level information extraction*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 7506–7516, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets relevant to the research presented in the paper.
