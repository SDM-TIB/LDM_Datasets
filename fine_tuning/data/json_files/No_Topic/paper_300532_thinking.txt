To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GWLAN: General Word-Level AutocompletioN for Computer-Aided Translation" by Huayang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a public benchmark for the GWLAN task, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that the training set for the Chinese-English tasks consists of **1.25 million bilingual sentence pairs from LDC corpora**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also specify that the validation data for GWLAN is extracted from **NIST02**, and the test datasets are constructed from **NIST05 and NIST06**. These datasets are crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed methods.

For the German-English tasks, they mention using the **WMT14 dataset**, with validation and test sets based on **newstest13 and newstest14**. This information is essential for a complete dataset extraction.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LDC corpora**, the citation is:
   > Linguistic Data Consortium. *LDC Catalog*. Available at: https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/

2. For the **NIST datasets**, the citation is:
   > National Institute of Standards and Technology. *NIST Open Machine Translation Evaluation*. Available at: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/open-machine-translation-evaluation

3. For the **WMT14 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
