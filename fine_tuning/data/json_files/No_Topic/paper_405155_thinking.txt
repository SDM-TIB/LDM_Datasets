To extract datasets from the research paper titled "API-Assisted Code Generation for Question Answering on Varied Table Structures" by Yihan Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the section specifically dedicated to datasets** (section 2). The abstract mentions that the authors experimented with four TableQA datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of table question answering and mention the need for a unified framework. They also hint at the datasets used for evaluation, but I need to find the exact names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Problem Setting and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **WikiTableQuestions (WikiTQ)**: This dataset contains relational tables collected from Wikipedia articles, with questions that often involve basic arithmetic operations and compositional reasoning. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pasupat, P., & Liang, P. (2015). *Compositional semantic parsing on semi-structured tables*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 3911–3921.

2. **HiTab**: This dataset consists of hierarchical matrix tables collected from statistical reports and Wikipedia articles, covering diverse domains. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Cheng, Z., Dong, H., Wang, Z., Jia, R., Guo, J., Gao, Y., Han, S., & Zhang, D. (2022). *HiTab: A hierarchical table dataset for question answering and natural language generation*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 1094–1110.

3. **AIT-QA**: This dataset focuses on the airline industry and contains tables with complex structures. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Katsis, Y., Chemmengath, S., Kumar, V., Bharadwaj, S., Canim, M., Glass, M., Gliozzo, A., Pan, F., Sen, J., Sankaranarayanan, K., & Chakrabarti, S. (2022). *AIT-QA: Question answering dataset over complex tables in the airline industry*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 305–314.

4. **Spider**: This is a multi-domain text-to-SQL benchmark with tables in a database format. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yu, T., Zhang, R., Yang, K., Yasunaga, M., Wang, D., Li, Z., Ma, J., Li, I., Yao, Q., Roman, S., Zhang, Z., & Radev, D. (2018). *Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 3911–3921.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution and reference.
