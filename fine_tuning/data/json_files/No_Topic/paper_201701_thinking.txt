To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Gender Bias in Abusive Language Detection" by Ji Ho Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the problem of biased training datasets in abusive language detection, which suggests that specific datasets are likely discussed later in the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of addressing biases in abusive language detection, indicating that datasets will be crucial to the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their research. In this section, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **Sexist Tweets (st)**: This dataset consists of tweets annotated for sexist content, collected from Twitter using specific search terms. The authors note that the dataset was created by Waseem and Hovy (2016) and Waseem (2016), focusing on gender biases.

2. **Abusive Tweets (abt)**: This dataset is a large-scale crowdsourced collection of abusive tweets, published by Founta et al. (2018). The authors describe the dataset's creation process and its classification scheme.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Sexist Tweets (st)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Zeerak Waseem and Dirk Hovy. 2016. Hateful symbols or hateful people? Predictive features for hate speech detection on Twitter. In Proceedings of the NAACL Student Research Workshop, pages 88â€“93.

- For the **Abusive Tweets (abt)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Antigoni-Maria Founta, Constantinos Djouvas, Despoina Chatzakou, Ilias Leontiadis, Jeremy Blackburn, Gianluca Stringhini, Athena Vakali, Michael Sirivianos, and Nicolas Kourtellis. 2018. Large scale crowdsourcing and characterization of Twitter abusive behavior. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
