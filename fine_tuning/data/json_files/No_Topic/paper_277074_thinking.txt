To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Asset Allocation For Outperforming A Stochastic Benchmark Target" by Chendi Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a data-driven neural network optimization framework but does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the importance of outperforming a stochastic benchmark and reference existing literature but do not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology and experiments sections**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their approach to testing the optimal adaptive strategy using historical market data. They mention using the **CRSP 3-month Treasury bill index** and the **CRSP cap-weighted total return index** as the two datasets for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CRSP datasets are typically cited as follows:

- For the **CRSP 3-month Treasury bill index**:
  > Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). *CRSP US Treasury Bill Index*. University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

- For the **CRSP cap-weighted total return index**:
  > Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). *CRSP US Cap-Weighted Total Return Index*. University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to note that they are part of the CRSP database.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
