To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Skies: A Novel Model for Flight-Level Passenger Traffic Forecasting" by Sina Ehsani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study leverages an extensive dataset from American Airlines, which suggests that there is a significant dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset is divided into three essential components:

1. **Seasonality Features**: This includes various temporal aspects such as the day of the week, week of the year, holiday occurrences, and flight details like origin and destination airports.

2. **Historical Traffic Data**: This segment details the number of passengers booked on each flight, segmented by specific periods relative to the flightâ€™s departure and fare class brackets.

3. **Fare Closure Information**: This component refers to specific time ranges during which certain fare classes or prices are unavailable for booking, providing insights into fare availability over time.

The authors do not provide specific names or external citations for these datasets, as they seem to be proprietary data from American Airlines. However, I will note that the dataset is comprehensive and includes various features relevant to flight-level passenger demand forecasting.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for the components of the dataset, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset from American Airlines**: This dataset encompasses historical passenger traffic data, seasonality features, and fare closure information, which are crucial for predicting flight-level passenger traffic.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset description.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Ehsani, S., Sergeeva, E., Murdy, W., & Fox, B. (2023). Predicting the Skies: A Novel Model for Flight-Level Passenger Traffic Forecasting. *Journal of Airline and Airport Management*, 13(1), 1-20.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide external dataset citations, it describes a proprietary dataset from American Airlines that is integral to the research. I will ensure to document this appropriately in the final output.
