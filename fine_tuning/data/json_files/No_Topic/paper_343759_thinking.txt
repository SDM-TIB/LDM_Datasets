To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifting the Information Ratio: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits" by Gergely Neu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections often detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, or references to prior works that might indicate the datasets employed in the study.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section may provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics that are important for understanding the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset Paper*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
