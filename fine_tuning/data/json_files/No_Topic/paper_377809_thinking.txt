To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Few-Shot Learning of Dense Prediction Tasks with Visual Token Matching" by Donggyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors experimented with a challenging variant of the **Taskonomy dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets used. Here, the authors mention the **Taskonomy dataset** again, specifying that it contains various annotations for dense prediction tasks. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used in their evaluations. The authors describe constructing a variant of the **Taskonomy dataset** to simulate few-shot learning of unseen dense prediction tasks. They list ten specific dense prediction tasks derived from this dataset, including semantic segmentation, surface normal prediction, and others.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the **Taskonomy dataset**, including its source and the specific tasks they utilized. They reference the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **Taskonomy dataset** as follows:

- For the **Taskonomy dataset**, the citation is:

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, its description, and the full citation. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner for further processing or review.
