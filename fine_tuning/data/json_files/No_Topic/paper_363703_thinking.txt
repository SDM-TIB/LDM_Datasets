To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic keypoint extraction for scanned animals using multi-depth-camera systems" by Raphael Falque et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is tested on data collected in the field, specifically on moving beef cattle, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of keypoint extraction in the context of livestock automation. They mention that the data collection was performed using a calibrated system of multiple hardware-synchronized RGB-D cameras, indicating that the data used for their experiments is likely derived from this setup.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide details about the data collection process, stating that they scanned 274 animals on one occasion and 136 animals on another. They describe how the point clouds were stitched together and manually annotated with keypoints. This indicates that there are two distinct datasets based on the different cohorts of animals scanned.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of point clouds collected from 274 animals scanned at the Tullimba feedlot research facility. The data was collected using a system of 17 RGB-D Realsense D435 cameras, which were extrinsically calibrated. The point clouds were manually annotated with 6 keypoints (the top of each leg, the hip, and the neck).

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset includes point clouds collected from a different cohort of 136 animals scanned under the same conditions as Dataset 1. Similar to the first dataset, the point clouds were also manually annotated with the same 6 keypoints.

Next, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will document the details of the datasets as described in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be based on the paper itself, as follows:

- For **Dataset 1**:
  > Falque, R., Vidal-Calleja, T., & Alempijevic, A. (2023). *Semantic keypoint extraction for scanned animals using multi-depth-camera systems*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date].

- For **Dataset 2**:
  > Falque, R., Vidal-Calleja, T., & Alempijevic, A. (2023). *Semantic keypoint extraction for scanned animals using multi-depth-camera systems*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
