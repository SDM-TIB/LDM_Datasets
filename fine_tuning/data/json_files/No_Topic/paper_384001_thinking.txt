To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable and Robust Tensor Ring Decomposition for Large-scale Data" by Yicong He and George K. Atia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a scalable and robust tensor ring decomposition algorithm but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or mention specific datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on image and video data, specifically referencing the **DIV2K dataset** for images and the **DAVIS 2016 dataset** for videos. This indicates that these datasets are used for evaluating the proposed methods.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **DIV2K dataset**: The citation is:
   > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops, July 2017.

2. **DAVIS 2016 dataset**: The citation is:
   > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Davis 2016: A benchmark for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
