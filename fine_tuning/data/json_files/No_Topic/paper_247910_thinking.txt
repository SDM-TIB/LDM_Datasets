To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Aggregation in Ensembles of Multilabel Classifiers" by Vu-Linh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **eight standard benchmark datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used in their experiments. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **Cal500**: This dataset has 174 instances, 6 nominal features, and 68 labels.
2. **Emotions**: This dataset contains 593 instances, 6 nominal features, and 72 labels.
3. **Scene**: This dataset consists of 2407 instances, 14 nominal features, and 294 labels.
4. **Yeast**: This dataset has 2417 instances, 101 nominal features, and 103 labels.
5. **Mediamill**: This dataset contains 43907 instances, 120 nominal features, and 10 labels.
6. **Medical**: This dataset has 978 instances, 0 nominal features, and 0 labels.
7. **Bibtex**: This dataset consists of 7395 instances, 45 nominal features, and 159 labels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are from the **MULAN repository**, which is a well-known source for multilabel datasets. Therefore, I will cite the repository as the source for all datasets.

The full citation for the MULAN repository is:
> Tsoumakas, G., & Katakis, I. (2007). Mining multi-label data. In Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Handbook (pp. 667-685). Springer.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, instance counts, feature types, and labels, along with the citation for the MULAN repository.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
