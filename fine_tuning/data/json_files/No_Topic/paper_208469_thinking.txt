To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometric Scattering on Manifolds" by Michael Perlmutter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. If there is a specific section titled "Datasets" or "Data Collection," I will focus on that section for detailed information.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors refer to datasets by name, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Stanford Bunny," I will look for the original citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Greg Turk and Marc Levoy. *The Stanford bunny*. 2005.

If the paper discusses multiple datasets, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant dataset information is accurately captured and attributed.
