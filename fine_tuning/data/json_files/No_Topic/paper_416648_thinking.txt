To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SARA: A Collection of Sensitivity-Aware Relevance Assessments" by Jack McKechnie and Graham McDonald, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a collection of relevance assessments for the Enron email collection, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the need for test collections that contain relevance assessments and sensitivity labels, specifically referencing the **Enron email collection** as a foundational dataset for their work.

In the **existing Enron email collection** section, the authors provide details about the dataset they are extending. They mention that the original Enron email collection was made available by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and has undergone various updates. This section confirms that the Enron email collection is the primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any specific details about the Enron dataset that need to be included.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the **Enron email collection**, and I will ensure to provide the citation as follows:

- For the **Enron email collection**, the citation is:
  > Klimt, B., & Yang, Y. (2004). Introducing the Enron corpus. In Proceedings of CEAS.

Additionally, the authors mention that their extension of the Enron collection, which includes sensitivity-aware relevance assessments, is available on GitHub and will be made available via the ir_datasets library. However, since this is an extension and not a separate dataset, I will focus on the original Enron email collection citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Enron email collection as the primary dataset used in this research.
