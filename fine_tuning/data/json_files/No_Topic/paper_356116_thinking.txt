To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Replay-Based Continual Semantic Segmentation with Smart Data Selection" by Tobias Kalb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses continual learning for semantic segmentation and hints at the use of benchmarks for evaluation, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using the **Disjoint Cityscapes (DJ-CS)** dataset, which is specifically designed for class-incremental semantic segmentation tasks. The paper states that DJ-CS is divided into three distinct subsets (S1, S2, and S3), each containing different classes, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **BDD100k** dataset for the domain-incremental setup. This dataset is known for its diverse driving scenarios, which aligns with the paper's focus on semantic segmentation in changing environments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Disjoint Cityscapes (DJ-CS)** dataset, the citation is:
   > T. Kalb, M. Roschani, M. Ruf, and J. Beyerer. *Continual learning for class- and domain-incremental semantic segmentation*. In 2021 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), pages 1345–1351, 2021.

2. For the **BDD100k** dataset, the citation is:
   > F. Yu, H. Chen, X. Wang, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. *BDD100k: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2636–2645, 2020.

3. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, which is also referenced in the context of the experiments, the citation is:
   > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
