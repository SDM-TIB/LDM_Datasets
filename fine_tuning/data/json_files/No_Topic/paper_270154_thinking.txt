To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulating Dysarthric Speech for Training Data Augmentation in Clinical Speech Applications" by Yishan Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors are simulating training data for clinical applications, which suggests that they may reference specific datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of obtaining large labeled datasets for clinical applications and mention a few existing datasets, specifically the **Nemours database** and the **TORGO database**. This is a good indication that these datasets are relevant to their work.

Next, I will look closely at the **methods section**, particularly where they describe their experimental settings. Here, they mention using a subset of a dysarthric speech dataset collected at Arizona State University, which consists of speech samples from 8 ALS speakers and 8 healthy speakers. This dataset is crucial for understanding their approach and results.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Nemours Database**: The citation is:
   > Menendez-Pidal, X., Polikoff, J. B., Peters, S. M., Leonzio, J. E., & Bunnell, H. T. (1996). The Nemours database of dysarthric speech. In Spoken Language, 1996. ICSLP 96. Proceedings., Fourth International Conference on (Vol. 3, pp. 1962–1965). IEEE.

2. **TORGO Database**: The citation is:
   > Rudzicz, F., Kumar Namasivayam, A., & Wolff, T. (2012). The TORGO database of acoustic and articulatory speech from speakers with dysarthria. Language Resources and Evaluation, 46(4), 523–541.

3. **Dysarthric Speech Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the dataset collected at Arizona State University, but they describe it in detail, indicating it consists of speech samples from 8 ALS speakers and 8 healthy speakers.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the Nemours and TORGO databases, while also noting the details of the dysarthric speech dataset used in their experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
