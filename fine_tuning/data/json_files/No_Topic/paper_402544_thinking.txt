To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FEDHYPER: A Universal and Robust Learning Rate Scheduler for Federated Learning with Hypergradient Descent" by Ziyao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on vision and language benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three benchmark datasets:

1. **FMNIST**: This dataset is referenced as being used for image classification. It is a well-known dataset that consists of fashion product images.

2. **CIFAR10**: Another dataset mentioned for image classification, CIFAR10 is a widely used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

3. **Shakespeare**: This dataset is used for the next-word prediction task. It consists of text data from the works of William Shakespeare.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Shakespeare**, the citation is:
  > Brendan McMahan, Eider Moore, Daniel Ramage, Seth Hampson, and Blaise Aguera y Arcas. *Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data*. In Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 1273â€“1282. PMLR, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and completeness. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution.
