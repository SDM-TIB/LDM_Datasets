To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Markov Subsampling based on Huber Criterion" by Tieliang Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the performance of their proposed method through extensive studies on large-scale simulations and real data examples. This suggests that there may be datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, there is a section titled **V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS**, which includes a table (Table I) that lists several datasets used in their experiments. 

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Appliances Energy Prediction**: This dataset contains 19,735 samples and 29 features.
2. **Poker Hand**: This dataset has 25,010 samples and 11 features.
3. **Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission**: This dataset consists of 36,733 samples and 11 features.
4. **Wave Energy Converters**: This dataset includes 288,000 samples and 32 features.
5. **PPPTS (Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure)**: This dataset has 45,730 samples and 9 features.
6. **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality**: This dataset contains 382,168 samples and 14 features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets come from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a common source for many datasets in machine learning research. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Appliances Energy Prediction**: 
  > "Appliances Energy Prediction Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Appliances+Energy+Prediction

- **Poker Hand**: 
  > "Poker Hand Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand

- **Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission**: 
  > "Gas Turbine CO and NOx Emission Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+Turbine+CO+and+NOx+Emission

- **Wave Energy Converters**: 
  > "Wave Energy Converters Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wave+Energy+Converters

- **PPPTS (Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure)**: 
  > "Physicochemical Properties of Protein Tertiary Structure Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Physicochemical+Properties+of+Protein+Tertiary+Structure

- **Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality**: 
  > "Beijing Multi-Site Air-Quality Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the dataset extraction process.
