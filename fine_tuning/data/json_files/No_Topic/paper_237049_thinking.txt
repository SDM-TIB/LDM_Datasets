To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MA-DST: Multi-Attention-Based Scalable Dialog State Tracking" by Adarsh Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset** and provide context about its characteristics, such as being a multi-domain dataset with labeled human-human conversations.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This dataset is an updated version of the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset, which contains around 10,000 dialogs spanning multiple domains and topics. It has been re-annotated to correct errors found in the previous version, making it cleaner and more challenging.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Eric, M., Goel, R., Paul, S., Sethi, A., Agarwal, S., Gao, S., & Hakkani-Tür, D. (2019). Multiwoz 2.1: Multi-domain dialogue state corrections and state tracking baselines. 

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: MultiWOZ 2.1
   - **Description**: A multi-domain dataset of labeled human-human conversations with around 10,000 dialogs, re-annotated for accuracy.
   - **Full Citation**: Eric, M., Goel, R., Paul, S., Sethi, A., Agarwal, S., Gao, S., & Hakkani-Tür, D. (2019). Multiwoz 2.1: Multi-domain dialogue state corrections and state tracking baselines.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset details and citations are accurately represented.
