To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Based Engagement Detection in Virtual Reality" by Ghassem Tofighi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses user engagement modeling and mentions a novel multi-modal model for engagement detection, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors mention using 3D skeleton tracking data for user engagement detection in meetings. However, they do not provide specific dataset names yet.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing their model. The authors describe capturing and labeling 23,210 frames from 5 different subjects who played a game designed for the study. This indicates that they created their own dataset for the experiments, but I need to confirm if they reference any publicly available datasets.

In the **results section**, they discuss the performance of their system and the number of frames labeled, but again, there are no mentions of external datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various studies and papers, but I need to determine if any of these correspond to datasets that were utilized in their research.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors primarily used their own dataset created from the game "Catch the Box!" and did not reference any external datasets. Therefore, I will document this dataset as follows:

1. **Catch the Box! Dataset**: This dataset consists of 23,210 frames captured from 5 different subjects playing the game, which was used to train and test the engagement detection model.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created for the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the context of its creation and usage in the research.

In summary, I will document the following dataset:
- **Catch the Box! Dataset**: Original dataset created for the study, consisting of 23,210 frames from 5 subjects.

I will ensure to format this information clearly for any downstream processing or review.
