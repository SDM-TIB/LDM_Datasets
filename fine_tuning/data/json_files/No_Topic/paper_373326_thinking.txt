To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkillRec: A Data-Driven Approach to Job Skill Recommendation for Career Insights" by Xiang Qian Ong and Kwan Hui Lim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted preliminary experiments on a dataset of **6,000 job titles and descriptions**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into **section II (Proposed Skill Recommendation System)**, where the authors describe the components of their system. In this section, they mention that they collected **6,000 job descriptions from three popular online job posting platforms**. This is a clear indication of a dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section (III)** to confirm the dataset's usage. The authors state that they used **80% of the collected dataset for training** and **20% for evaluation**, which further validates the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I need to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the authors do not provide a specific reference for the dataset of job listings, I will note that it is derived from publicly available job postings. However, I will also look for any references in the **References section** that might relate to the sources of the job listings or similar datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific citations for the dataset of job listings. Therefore, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Job Listings Dataset**: This dataset consists of **6,000 job descriptions** collected from various online job posting platforms. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is based on publicly available information.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the details I have gathered. Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is based on publicly available job postings without a specific reference.

After this, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
