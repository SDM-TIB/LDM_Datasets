To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning with an Information Maximization Criterion" by Serdar Ozsoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, CorInfoMax, is evaluated on various datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 32x32 images across 10 classes, with 5,000 training images and 1,000 validation images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 500 training images and 100 validation images per class.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A dataset with 64x64 images across 200 classes, with 500 training images and 50 validation images per class.
4. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, used for training, with a separate validation set of 50,000 images.
5. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet-1K containing 100 classes, with 1,300 training images and 50 validation images per class.
6. **COCO**: A dataset containing 164,000 images with annotations for various tasks like object detection and segmentation, with 118,000 images for training and 5,000 for validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
