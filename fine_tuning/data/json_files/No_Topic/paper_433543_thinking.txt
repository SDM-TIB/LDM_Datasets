To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRoTECT: Parallelized ConstRuction of SafeTy BarriEr Certiﬁcates for Nonlinear Polynomial SysTems" by Ben Wooding, Viacheslav Horbanov, and Abolfazl Lavaei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that describe the methodology and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool PRoTECT and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **section 7 (Benchmarking and Case Studies)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets or case studies used to evaluate the tool. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant citations.

In the case studies, I notice several systems are referenced, such as:

1. **Room Temperature System**: This system is based on a previous work and is described in detail, including its dynamics and parameters. The citation for this dataset is:
   > [23] Adewuyi, P.A.: DC motor speed control: A case between PID controller and fuzzy logic controller. International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Engineering 4(4), 36–40 (2013).

2. **2D Van der Pol Oscillator**: This benchmark is taken from the ARCH competition for stochastic models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > [2] Abate, A., Blom, H., Cauchi, N., et al.: ARCH-COMP20 Category Report: Stochastic Models (2020).

3. **Two-Tank System**: This system is also referenced with a citation:
   > [28] Ramos, J.A., Dos Santos, P.L.: Mathematical modeling, system identification, and controller design of a two tank system. In: 2007 46th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control. pp. 2838–2843. IEEE (2007).

4. **3D Room Temperature System**: This case study is based on another reference:
   > [17] Lavaei, A., Khaled, M., Soudjani, S., et al.: AMYTISS: Parallelized automated controller synthesis for large-scale stochastic systems. In: International Conference on Computer Aided Verification. pp. 461–474. Springer (2020).

I will also check the **References section** to ensure I have the complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the case studies.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citation is included for each one.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
