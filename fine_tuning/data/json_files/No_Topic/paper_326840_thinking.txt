To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentially Describing Groups of Graphs" by Corinna Coupette et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for graph group analysis and mentions experiments on synthetic and real-world graph groups, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. The authors describe their experiments on various graph types, including functional brain networks, air transportation networks, and international trade networks. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

In the **experiments** section, I will pay close attention to the descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Functional Brain Networks**: The authors mention using graphs from preprocessed functional connectomes provided by the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange. This dataset is crucial for understanding neurological disorders, particularly autism.

2. **Air Transportation Networks**: The paper states that data on passenger flows between domestic airports in the United States was obtained from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This dataset spans from January 2005 to December 2020 and is significant for analyzing air traffic patterns.

3. **International Trade Networks**: The authors describe obtaining data on international trade flows from the World Integrated Trade Solution for the years 1989 to 2018. This dataset is important for studying global trade dynamics.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange**, the citation is:
  > Craddock, C.; Benhajali, Y.; Chu, C.; Chouinard, F.; Evans, A.; Jakab, A.; Khundrakpam, B. S.; Lewis, J. D.; Li, Q.; Milham, M.; et al. *The neuro bureau preprocessing initiative: open sharing of preprocessed neuroimaging data and derivatives*. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics, 7, 2013.

- For the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics**, the citation is:
  > Bureau of Transportation Statistics. *Data Bank 28DS - T-100 Domestic Segment Data (World Area Code)*. https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/bts-publications/data-bank-28ds-t-100-domestic-segment-data, 2021.

- For the **World Integrated Trade Solution**, the citation is:
  > World Bank. *World Integrated Trade Solution*. https://wits.worldbank.org/Default.aspx?lang=en, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
