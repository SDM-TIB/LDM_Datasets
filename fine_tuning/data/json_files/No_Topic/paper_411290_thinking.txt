To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Women Are Beautiful, Men Are Leaders: Gender Stereotypes in Machine Translation and Language Modeling" by Matúš Pikuliak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the GEST dataset, which is specifically created to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in language models and machine translation systems. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the GEST dataset is described in detail in **section 3 (GEST Dataset)**. Here, the authors explain the dataset's purpose, structure, and the number of samples it contains.

The GEST dataset is defined as follows:
- **GEST Dataset**: A manually created dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in language models and machine translation systems. It contains samples for 16 gender stereotypes about men and women, compatible with English and 9 Slavic languages. The dataset consists of 3,565 samples.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the GEST dataset was used in their evaluations. The authors mention using GEST to evaluate various language models and machine translation systems, which reinforces its significance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the GEST dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset's repository, which is crucial for proper citation:
- GEST Dataset: Pikuliak, M., Hrckova, A., Oresko, S., & Šimko, M. (2023). GEST: A dataset for measuring gender-stereotypical reasoning in language models. Available at: https://github.com/kinit-sk/gest

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **GEST Dataset**: A dataset designed to measure gender-stereotypical reasoning in language models and machine translation systems, containing 3,565 samples across 16 gender stereotypes. 
   - Citation: Pikuliak, M., Hrckova, A., Oresko, S., & Šimko, M. (2023). GEST: A dataset for measuring gender-stereotypical reasoning in language models. Available at: https://github.com/kinit-sk/gest

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is structured appropriately for any further processing or review.
