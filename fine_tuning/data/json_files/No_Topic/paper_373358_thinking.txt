To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neurodiversity-Inspired Solver for the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC) Using Visual Imagery and Program Synthesis" by James Ainooson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the authors' performance on the **Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC)**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing the ARC** in detail. The authors describe the ARC as a general intelligence test with a publicly available training set of 400 tasks, an evaluation set of 400 tasks, and a private test set of 200 tasks. This section provides a clear overview of the dataset structure and its significance in their experiments.

In the **Results section**, the authors mention their performance on the ARC tasks, confirming that they utilized the ARC dataset for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the ARC dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ARC dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC)**, the citation is:
  > Chollet, F. (2019). *On the Measure of Intelligence*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.11103.

Since the ARC is a well-known dataset introduced by Fran√ßois Chollet, this citation is authoritative.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the ARC dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for any further processing or review.
