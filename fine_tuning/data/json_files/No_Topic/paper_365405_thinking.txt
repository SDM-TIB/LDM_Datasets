To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Découvrir de nouvelles classes dans des données tabulaires" by Colin Troisemaine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which is Novel Class Discovery (NCD) in tabular data. It does not mention specific datasets, but the introduction may provide more context.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention six tabular datasets and the MNIST dataset. I will extract the names and details of these datasets, including the number of classes, attributes, and the distribution of labeled and unlabeled data.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, with 784 attributes (28x28 pixel images).
2. **Forest Cover Type**: A dataset used for predicting forest cover types, with 54 attributes.
3. **Letter Recognition**: A dataset for recognizing letters, with 16 attributes.
4. **Human Activity Recognition**: A dataset for classifying human activities, with 562 attributes.
5. **Satimage**: A dataset related to satellite imagery, with 36 attributes.
6. **Pendigits**: A dataset for recognizing handwritten digits, with 16 attributes.
7. **1990 US Census**: A dataset containing census data, with 67 attributes.

In the same section, the authors provide statistical information about each dataset, including the number of training and test samples, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Forest Cover Type**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Cutler, et al. *Random Forests for Classification in Ecology*. Ecology, 2007.

- For **Letter Recognition**, the citation is:
  > J. A. L. et al. *Letter Recognition Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For **Human Activity Recognition**, the citation is:
  > Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., Parra, X., & Reyes-Ortiz, J. L. *A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones*. 2013.

- For **Satimage**, the citation is:
  > NASA. *Satellite Image Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For **Pendigits**, the citation is:
  > Alpaydin, E. *Pendigits Dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- For **1990 US Census**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Census Bureau. *1990 Census of Population and Housing*. 1990.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
