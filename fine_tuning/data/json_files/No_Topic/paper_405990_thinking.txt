To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Three-dimensional Bone Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks" by Christoph Angermann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a database of three-dimensional HR-pQCT instances representing bone micro-architecture, indicating that a dataset is involved. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of data availability in medical imaging, which further emphasizes the importance of the dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, section 3.1 (Data Acquisition and Preprocessing) provides detailed information about the dataset used for experimentation. The authors describe the dataset as consisting of 404 bone volumes obtained through HR-pQCT from patients with fractures of the distal radius. They also mention that the dataset was reduced from 515 volumes due to scanning quality issues.

I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: HR-pQCT Bone Volumes
- **Description**: The dataset consists of 404 three-dimensional bone volumes obtained from HR-pQCT scans of patients with distal radius fractures. The volumes were scanned at six time points over one year, focusing on non-fractured sites.
- **Total Instances**: 404 volumes after quality filtering.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HR-pQCT dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on the authors' own data collection from a study conducted at the Medical University of Innsbruck. However, I can reference the original work on HR-pQCT imaging that is cited in the paper:

- **Citation for HR-pQCT**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
