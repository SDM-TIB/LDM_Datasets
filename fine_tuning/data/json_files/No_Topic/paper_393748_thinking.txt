To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering interpretable elastoplasticity models via the neural polynomial method enabled symbolic regressions" by Bahador Bahmani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions "numerical examples" and "an open-source code," which suggests that there may be datasets used for these examples. I will look for any specific dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will carefully read through the **methodology** and **results** sections. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss various numerical examples and benchmarks. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their sources and citation details.

I will also check the **references** section for any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Stress Points Dataset**: This dataset is generated for the purpose of testing the proposed method. It consists of 2,400 different admissible stress states, augmented to 26,400 points through a signed distance function. The dataset is described in detail in Section 3.1.

   Citation:
   > This dataset is synthesized based on the von Mises yield criterion as described in the paper.

2. **Porous Metal Dataset**: This dataset includes 66,000 stress points generated for the study of plastic yield surfaces of porous metal material. It is mentioned in Section 3.2 and includes various parameters such as hydrostatic pressure and void volume fraction.

   Citation:
   > The dataset is based on the model discovered by Bomarito et al. (2021), which describes the plastic behavior of porous materials.

3. **Benchmark Dataset**: The authors also refer to a benchmark dataset used for validating the proposed method, which includes 13,200 stress points sampled for a specific material model.

   Citation:
   > Matsuoka, H., & Nakai, T. (1974). Stress-deformation and strength characteristics of soil under three different principal stresses. Proceedings of the Japan Society of Civil Engineers, 1974(232), 59-70.

After identifying these datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
