To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EPOSIT: An Absolute Pose Estimation Method for Pinhole and Fish-Eye Cameras" by Zhaobing Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant metrics or results associated with them.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **synthetic data** and **real data** for their experiments, but they do not specify any named datasets. However, they do refer to the use of a **chessboard** for calibration, which is a common setup in camera pose estimation studies. 

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets or methodologies that involve datasets. This could include foundational papers that describe datasets commonly used in the field of camera pose estimation.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers related to camera calibration and pose estimation, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. 

Given this analysis, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors mention using synthetic data generated for testing their algorithm, but no specific dataset name is provided.
2. **Real Data**: The authors refer to using real data for experiments, specifically mentioning a chessboard for calibration, but again, no specific dataset is named.
3. **Chessboard Calibration**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, the chessboard is a standard tool used in camera calibration and pose estimation.

Since no formal datasets are cited in the paper, I will note that the authors did not provide full citations for any datasets, which is important for reproducibility and further research.

In conclusion, I will document that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, and I will highlight the use of synthetic data and a chessboard for calibration as part of their experimental methodology. This will be useful for anyone looking to understand the context of the experiments conducted in this research.
