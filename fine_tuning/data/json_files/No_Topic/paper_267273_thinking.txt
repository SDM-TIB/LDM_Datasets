To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Average activity of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations" by Javier Roulet and Gabriel B. Mindlin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Data"**, **"Methods"**, or **"Experiments"**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mention of numerical simulations or empirical data, as these often indicate the presence of datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, if the authors mention using specific datasets for their simulations or analyses, I will record the names and any relevant details about these datasets, such as their size, type, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

If the paper references datasets from other studies, I will ensure to extract the full citation for those original sources as well. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset created by another researcher, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or review.
