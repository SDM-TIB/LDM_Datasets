To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Height-Dependent LoS Probability Model for A2G MmWave Communications under Built-up Scenarios" by Minghui Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction may highlight the need for datasets or reference existing ones, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of data sources or experimental setups.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their methodology and simulation parameters in detail, which may include information about the datasets used for validation or comparison. I will focus on sections that describe the simulation methods and any data used in those simulations.

In the **simulation section**, the authors mention using ray-tracing (RT) techniques to validate their model. They describe the parameters for their simulations, including frequency, bandwidth, and heights of transmitters and receivers. However, they do not explicitly mention a dataset in the traditional sense (like a publicly available dataset). Instead, they generate simulation data based on their model.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to the study. I will look for papers that might have published datasets related to A2G communications or LoS probability modeling.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations that could be associated with datasets or methodologies used in similar studies:

1. **3GPP TR 38.901**: This document outlines channel models for various scenarios, including those relevant to A2G communications. While it may not be a dataset in the traditional sense, it provides essential modeling parameters that could be considered a resource for researchers in the field.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather simulation results based on theoretical models, I will summarize the findings and the relevant citations as they pertain to the context of datasets in this research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the relevant citations and their significance in the context of the study.
