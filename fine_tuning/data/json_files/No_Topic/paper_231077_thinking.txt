To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Visualization approach to assess the robustness of neural networks for medical image classification" by Elina Thibeau-Sutrea et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction provides context about the study, while the materials and methods section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they adapted a method for 3D medical images and focus on Alzheimer's disease detection, which suggests the use of relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Data description and preprocessing)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used two public datasets: 

1. **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**: This dataset includes T1-weighted MRI scans used for classifying subjects into cognitively normal (CN) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups.

2. **Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL)**: Similar to ADNI, this dataset also provides T1-weighted MRI scans for the same classification purpose.

The authors provide demographic details and the specific types of MRI data used, confirming that both datasets are integral to their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ADNI dataset**, the citation is:
> Jack, C. R., Bernstein, M. A., Fox, N. C., et al. (2008). *The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): MRI methods.* NeuroImage, 43(1), 92-106.

For the **AIBL dataset**, the citation is:
> Ellis, K. A., Bush, A. I., Darby, D., et al. (2009). *The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study of aging: methodology and baseline characteristics of 1,110 individuals recruited for the study.* Neuropsychology, Development, and Cognition. Section B, Aging, Neuropsychology and Cognition, 16(5), 555-580.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
