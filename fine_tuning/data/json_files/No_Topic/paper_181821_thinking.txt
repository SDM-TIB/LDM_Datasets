To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast K-Means with Accurate Bounds" by James Newling and Fran√ßois Fleuret, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted with various algorithms but does not specify dataset names. The introduction provides context about the k-means problem but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors present a table (Table 1) that lists 22 datasets used for their experiments, along with their dimensions and sizes.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset from this table. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **birch**: 100,000 samples, 2 dimensions.
2. **europe**: 169,300 samples, 2 dimensions.
3. **urand2**: 1,000,000 samples, 2 dimensions.
4. **ldfpads**: 164,850 samples, 3 dimensions.
5. **conflongdemo**: 200,000 samples, 3 dimensions.
6. **skinseg**: 200,000 samples, 4 dimensions.
7. **tsn**: 68,040 samples, 4 dimensions.
8. **colormoments**: 40,760 samples, 9 dimensions.
9. **mv**: 165,630 samples, 15 dimensions.
10. **wcomp**: 22,780 samples, 17 dimensions.
11. **house16h**: 28 samples, 68 dimensions.
12. **keggnet**: 65,550 samples, 30 dimensions.
13. **urand30**: 60,000 samples, 50 dimensions.
14. **mnist50**: 130,060 samples, 50 dimensions.
15. **miniboone**: 55 samples, 50 dimensions.
16. **covtype**: 581,012 samples, 68 dimensions.
17. **uscensus**: 2,458,285 samples, 74 dimensions.
18. **kddcup04**: 145,750 samples, 108 dimensions.
19. **stl10**: 128 samples, 128 dimensions.
20. **gassensor**: 310 samples, 310 dimensions.
21. **kddcup98**: 784 samples, 784 dimensions.
22. **mnist784**: 60,000 samples, 784 dimensions.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific references for each dataset, as they are commonly known datasets in the machine learning community. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are widely recognized and can be referenced as follows:

- **UCI Machine Learning Repository** for datasets like **birch**, **europe**, **skinseg**, **covtype**, etc.
- **KDD Cup datasets** for **kddcup04** and **kddcup98**.
- **MNIST dataset** for **mnist50** and **mnist784**.
- **STL-10 dataset** for **stl10**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details, ensuring to include the common sources for citation where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the experiments of the paper.
