To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Visual Classification with Real-World Data Distribution" by Tzu-Ming Harry Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of "two new large-scale datasets for species and landmark classification," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **iNaturalist-User-120k**: This dataset is derived from the iNaturalist 2017 Challenge and contains 579,184 training examples and 95,986 test examples across over 5,000 classes. It includes fine-grained species labels and geographic information.

2. **Landmarks-User-160k**: This dataset is based on the Google Landmarks Dataset V2 (GLD-v2) and consists of 164,172 images of 2,028 landmarks contributed by 1,262 users. The dataset is designed for landmark recognition and retrieval.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **iNaturalist-2017**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Mac Aodha, O., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Adam, H., Perona, P., Belongie, S. (2018). *The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 8769â€“8778.

- For **Google Landmarks Dataset V2**, the citation is:
  > Weyand, T., Araujo, A., Cao, B., Sim, J. (2020). *Google Landmarks Dataset V2 - a large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
