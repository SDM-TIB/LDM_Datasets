To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning" by Olivier Buffet, Olivier Pietquin, and Paul Weng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a general overview of reinforcement learning but does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses various applications of reinforcement learning but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **background and methodology sections** for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations. I will pay close attention to sections that describe experiments, as they often include details about the datasets employed.

As I progress through the paper, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Experiments," "Datasets," or "Data Collection." If the paper includes a dedicated section on datasets, I will summarize the key details, including the name of each dataset, its purpose, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets, I will ensure to provide the original citations for those datasets, even if they are not explicitly listed in the paper. For example, if the paper mentions using the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning experiments, I will include the citation for the OpenAI Gym dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
