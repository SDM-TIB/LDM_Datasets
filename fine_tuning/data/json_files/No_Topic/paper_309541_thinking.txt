To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localized Graph Collaborative Filtering" by Yiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that they tested their framework on **twelve datasets** from three different real-world recommendation scenarios: Tianchi, Amazon, and MovieLens. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets are categorized based on their source.

In this section, the authors specify that they constructed seven datasets from the Tianchi dataset, two from Amazon, and two from MovieLens. I will need to note down the specific names of these datasets as they are mentioned.

The datasets are referred to as **Tianchi-ID**, where ID indicates the item category, and the specific datasets from Amazon and MovieLens are also mentioned. I will ensure to capture the exact names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

For the **Tianchi datasets**, the citation is:
> User behavior data from Taobao for recommendation. Available at: https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=649&userId=1. Accessed May 23, 2021.

For the **Amazon datasets**, the citation is:
> J. McAuley, Amazon product data. Available at: http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. Accessed May 23, 2021.

For the **MovieLens datasets**, the citation is:
> F. M. Harper and J. A. Konstan, The MovieLens datasets: History and context, ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5 (2015).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets along with their respective citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured clearly and include all necessary information for future reference or analysis.
