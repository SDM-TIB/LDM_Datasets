To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Playtime Measurement with Survival Analysis" by Markus Viljanen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of survival analysis methods to analyze playtime data from a mobile game, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the importance of player retention and playtime metrics, indicating that specific datasets will likely be discussed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of specific datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the playtime data collected from the mobile game "Hipster Sheep." They mention that the data was logged using an in-house framework, which indicates that this is a primary dataset used for their analysis.

In the **Playtime Data** section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the total number of players and the nature of the data collected (total playtime, session playtime, etc.). They specifically mention that they analyzed the total playtimes of players from the game, which is crucial for understanding the context of their survival analysis.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that the dataset is used for the analyses presented in the paper. The authors discuss various metrics derived from the playtime data, such as survival curves and hazard functions, which further validates the significance of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is derived from the game "Hipster Sheep," developed by Tribeﬂame Ltd. The citation for this dataset is as follows:

- **Hipster Sheep Playtime Dataset**: 
  > Tribeﬂame Ltd. *Hipster Sheep*. [Mobile Game]. Available at: [Google Play Store link or official website if available].

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation. This will allow me to present the information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
