To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network Modeling for Short Over-Dispersed Spike-Counts: A Hierarchical Parametric Empirical Bayes Framework" by Qi She et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to both simulated data and experimental neural data from the retina. This indicates that there are at least two types of datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **results** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of working with limited samples of spike counts and the need for effective modeling techniques. This suggests that they may have used specific datasets to validate their methods.

In the **results** section, the authors explicitly mention using **four retinal datasets** taken from visual experiments, which are crucial for validating their model. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including the number of neurons involved in each dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the **retinal datasets** as being part of the ret-1 database curated at CRCNS.org. I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

The specific datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Retinal Dataset #62413**: Contains recordings from 37 neurons.
2. **Retinal Dataset #62423**: Contains recordings from 26 neurons.
3. **Retinal Dataset #62814**: Contains recordings from 15 neurons.
4. **Retinal Dataset #62871**: Contains recordings from 14 neurons.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the ret-1 database is:
> Lefebvre, J. L., Zhang, Y., Meister, M., Wang, X., & Sanes, J. R. (2008). Î³-protocadherins regulate neuronal survival but are dispensable for circuit formation in retina. *Development*, 135(24), 4141-4151.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
