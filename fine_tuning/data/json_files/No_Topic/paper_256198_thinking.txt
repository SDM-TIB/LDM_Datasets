To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introspective Learning by Distilling Knowledge from Online Self-explanation" by Jindong Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on the **CIFAR10** and **MNIST** datasets. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific configurations or modifications mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and results using the CIFAR10 dataset, which is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks. They also mention using the MNIST dataset for training a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). I will ensure to capture the details about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR10 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I will look for its authoritative citation. The MNIST dataset is also widely used, so I will find its citation as well.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., Haffner, P., et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278-2324, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
