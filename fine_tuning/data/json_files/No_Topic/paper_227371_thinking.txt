To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Sampling Algorithm for Non-smooth Composite Potentials" by Wenlong Mou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors describe how they utilized these datasets in their experiments, I will take note of that as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset" and provides a citation, I will record it as follows:
- **Penn Action Dataset**: 
  > Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

If the paper also mentions another dataset, such as "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will follow the same process to document it:
- **sub-JHMDB Dataset**: 
  > Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, 2013.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
