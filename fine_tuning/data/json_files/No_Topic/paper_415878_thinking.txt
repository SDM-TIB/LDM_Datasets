To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DISENTANGLE ESTIMATION OF CAUSAL EFFECTS FROM CROSS-SILO DATA" by Yuxuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on new semi-synthetic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In **section 4.1**, they mention the use of semi-synthetic datasets for causal effect estimation. They also refer to specific datasets later in the section, particularly the **Twins dataset** and the **IHDP dataset**.

1. **Twins Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 11,400 twin pairs with 39 variables, commonly used for causal inference. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **IHDP Dataset**: This dataset is used to assess interventions for preterm infants and contains 747 samples with 25 covariates. It is also a well-known dataset in the field of causal inference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Twins dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jennifer L. Hill. "Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference." *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, vol. 20, no. 1, pp. 217–240, 2011.

- For the **IHDP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Susan Athey and Guido Imbens. "Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects." *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, vol. 113, no. 27, pp. 7353–7360, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
