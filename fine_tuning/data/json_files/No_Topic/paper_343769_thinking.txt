To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AsyncFedED: Asynchronous Federated Learning with Euclidean Distance based Adaptive Weight Aggregation" by Qiyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on three commonly used Non-IID datasets for federated learning, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Numerical results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **Synthetic-1-1 Dataset**: This dataset is generated based on a specific rule and is designed to test federated learning algorithms under varying degrees of Non-IIDness.

2. **FEMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is an extension of the MNIST dataset, containing handwritten characters and designed for federated learning testing. It includes 805,263 samples divided into 3,500 sub-datasets.

3. **Shakespeare Text Data**: This dataset is derived from the complete works of William Shakespeare, where each role's dialog is assigned to a different client for next character prediction tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Synthetic-1-1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Li, M. Sanjabi, A. Beirami, and V. Smith. *Fair resource allocation in federated learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10497, 2019.

- For **FEMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Caldas, S. M. K. Duddu, P. Wu, T. Li, J. Konečný, H. B. McMahan, V. Smith, and A. Talwalkar. *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01097, 2018.

- For **Shakespeare Text Data**, the citation is:
  > B. McMahan, E. Moore, D. Ramage, S. Hampson, and B. A. y Arcas. *Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data*. In Artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 1273–1282. PMLR, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
