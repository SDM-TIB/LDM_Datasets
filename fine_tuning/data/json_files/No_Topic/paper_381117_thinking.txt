To extract datasets from the research paper titled "B-Learner: Quasi-Oracle Bounds on Heterogeneous Causal Effects Under Hidden Confounding" by Miruna Oprescu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the B-Learner and its application to real-world data, which suggests that datasets may be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their evaluations. Here, they mention using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, as well as a real-world dataset related to 401(k) eligibility. This indicates that there are at least two types of datasets to extract.

In **subsection 5.1 (Simulated Data)**, the authors describe a synthetic dataset generated for their experiments. They provide details about how the data is sampled, which includes specific distributions and parameters. I will note this dataset as follows:
- **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated using a specific sampling process involving uniform distributions and normal distributions.

In **subsection 5.2 (IHDP Hidden Confounding)**, the authors refer to the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) dataset, which has been modified to include hidden confounding. They provide a detailed description of the dataset's structure and the variables involved. I will document this dataset as:
- **IHDP Dataset**: A modified version of the original IHDP dataset, which includes various covariates related to infant health and development.

In **subsection 5.3 (Impact of 401(k) Eligibility on Wealth Distribution)**, the authors mention using a dataset from Chernozhukov & Hansen (2004) that examines the effects of 401(k) eligibility on financial wealth. I will extract this dataset citation as well:
- **401(k) Eligibility Dataset**: A dataset from the 1991 Survey of Income and Program Participation, used to analyze the impact of 401(k) eligibility on net financial assets.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations I will extract are:
1. For the **IHDP Dataset**:
   > Hill, J. L. (2011). Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference. *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 20(1), 217–240.

2. For the **401(k) Eligibility Dataset**:
   > Chernozhukov, V., & Hansen, C. (2004). The effects of 401(k) participation on the wealth distribution: an instrumental quantile regression analysis. *Review of Economics and Statistics*, 86(3), 735–751.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations.
