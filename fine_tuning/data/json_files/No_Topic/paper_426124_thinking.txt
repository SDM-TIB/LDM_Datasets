To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPAFormer: Sequential 3D Part Assembly with Transformers" by Boshen Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new benchmark called **PartNet-Assembly**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors describe the dataset setup in detail. They mention that they expanded the available objects to include **21 categories**, which is a significant detail. The authors state that **PartNet-Assembly** contains **22,873 shapes from 21 object categories with 173,765 distinct parts**. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's scope and structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **PartNet-Assembly** dataset. The authors reference the original PartNet paper, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the PartNet dataset is:

> Mo, K., Zhu, S., Chang, A.X., Yi, L., Tripathi, S., Guibas, L.J., Su, H. "PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. pp. 909â€“918 (2019).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. 

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify the mention of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to gather detailed information about the dataset.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section for proper attribution.

With this information, I can now create a comprehensive entry for the **PartNet-Assembly** dataset.
