To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BENCHIP: Benchmarking Intelligence Processors" by Jinhua Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark suite, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Benchmark Suite)**, where the authors describe the benchmarks included in BENCHIP. Here, they categorize benchmarks into **microbenchmarks** and **macrobenchmarks**. I will look for specific datasets associated with these benchmarks.

In **subsection 2.2.2 (Macrobenchmarks)**, the authors list several well-known neural networks that serve as macrobenchmarks, which are directly extracted from real applications. The networks mentioned include:

1. **LeNet-5**: Used for handwritten digit recognition, associated with the **MNIST dataset**.
2. **RNN**: Used for speech recognition, associated with the **WSJ dataset**.
3. **AlexNet**: Used for image classification, associated with the **ImageNet dataset**.
4. **VGG**: Also used for image classification, associated with the **ImageNet dataset**.
5. **ResNet**: Used for image classification, associated with the **ImageNet dataset**.
6. **Faster R-CNN**: Used for object detection, associated with the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**.
7. **Deep Face Recognition**: Associated with the **LFW dataset** (Labeled Faces in the Wild).
8. **DeconvNet**: Used for semantic segmentation, associated with the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**.
9. **FCLN**: Used for image captioning, associated with the **Visual Genome dataset**.
10. **S2VT**: Used for video captioning, associated with the **MSVD dataset** (Microsoft Video Description dataset).
11. **SyntaxNet**: Used for natural language processing, associated with the **WSJ dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
