To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Quantum Process Tomography via Riemannian Gradient Descent" by Daniel Volya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulations and hardware characterizations, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Case Study: Simulation of Quantum Processes)** and **section V (Steady States of Nondemolishing Measurement in Quantum Hardware)**, as these sections are likely to contain specific datasets used for experiments. In these sections, the authors describe their experiments and the data they collected.

In **section IV**, the authors mention using a random channel for their simulations and describe the data collected from measurements. They refer to the data as being generated from a quantum process, but they do not explicitly name a dataset. However, they do provide details about the experimental setup and the types of measurements taken.

In **section V**, the authors describe running experiments on IBM Quantum computers and mention the data collected from these trials. They refer to the measurements of the system state after each non-demolishing measurement, but again, they do not specify a formal dataset name.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will look for any references to datasets in the **References section**. I will check if any of the cited works provide datasets that were used in the experiments described in the paper.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works related to quantum process tomography and measurement techniques. However, they do not provide specific datasets or their citations in the main text.

Given this analysis, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors generated data from simulations of quantum processes, but no specific dataset name or citation is provided.
2. **Experimental Data**: Data collected from experiments on IBM Quantum computers is mentioned, but again, no specific dataset name or citation is provided.

Since no formal datasets are explicitly named in the paper, I will note that while the authors discuss their experimental and simulated data, they do not provide specific datasets or citations for them.

In conclusion, I will prepare a summary of the findings without specific dataset citations, as the paper does not provide them. If I were to create a structured output, it would reflect the lack of explicit dataset names and citations based on the content of the paper.
