To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Generative Modeling for Volume Reconstruction in Cryo-Electron Microscopy" by Claire Donnat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used. In this case, the authors mention the use of various datasets for evaluating their methods, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets. I will look for any explicit references to datasets, including their names and characteristics.

I will then examine the **experiments section** and any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets used in the study. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for the datasets used.

For example, if the authors mention the "Ribosome 80S" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is associated with a specific study or database, I will ensure to include that citation in my extraction.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
