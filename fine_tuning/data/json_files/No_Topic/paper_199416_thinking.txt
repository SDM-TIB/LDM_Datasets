To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Game-Theoretic Interpretability for Temporal Modeling" by Guang-He Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel approach to model interpretability, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for interpretability in predictive models but do not mention specific datasets. Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any datasets used for validation of their approach.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Bearing Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from NASA and records 4-channel acceleration data on 4 co-located bearings. The authors reference a previous work for this dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **Stock Market Dataset**: This dataset consists of historical data from the S&P 500 index, which includes daily prices (open, high, low, and close). The authors note that they transformed the data to daily percentage differences for their analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Bearing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lee, J., Qiu, H., Yu, G., Lin, J., and Rexnord Technical Services. *NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository*. 2016. Available at: http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/project/prognostic-data-repository.

- For the **Stock Market Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S&P 500 historical data. Available at: www.kaggle.com/camnugent/sandp500/data.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution and clarity.
