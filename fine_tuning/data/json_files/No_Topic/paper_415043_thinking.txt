To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cycle-Consistency Learning for Captioning and Grounding" by Ning Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets and Metrics**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Visual Genome**: This dataset is referenced as a source of image-text pairs used during the pre-training stage.
2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: Another dataset mentioned for image-text pairs, specifically noted for its use in the captioning task.
3. **RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg**: These datasets are specifically used for evaluating visual grounding performance.

I will extract the relevant details about each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific splits mentioned (e.g., train, validation, test).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **Visual Genome**:
  > Krishna, R.; Zhu, Y.; Groth, O.; Johnson, J.; Hata, K.; Kravitz, J.; Chen, S.; Kalantidis, Y.; Li, L.-J.; Shamma, D. A.; et al. 2017. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. IJCV, 123(1): 32–73.

- For **COCO**:
  > Lin, T.-Y.; Maire, M.; Belongie, S.; Hays, J.; Perona, P.; Ramanan, D.; Dollár, P.; and Zitnick, C. L. 2014. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In ECCV.

- For **RefCOCO**:
  > Yu, L.; Poirson, P.; Yang, S.; Berg, A. C.; and Berg, T. L. 2016. *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In ECCV.

- For **RefCOCO+**:
  > Yu, L.; Poirson, P.; Yang, S.; Berg, A. C.; and Berg, T. L. 2016. *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In ECCV.

- For **RefCOCOg**:
  > Mao, J.; Huang, J.; Toshev, A.; Camburu, O.; Yuille, A. L.; and Murphy, K. 2016. *Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions*. In CVPR.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries in a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in accordance with academic standards.
