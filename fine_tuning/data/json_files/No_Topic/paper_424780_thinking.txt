To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Causal Features for Incremental Object Detection" by Zhenwei He and Lei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of object detection and mentions the use of several datasets for experiments, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Pascal VOC**: The authors describe it as a well-known benchmark for object detection, containing 9963 images with annotations for 20 different object categories. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is noted for capturing high-quality images in various urban environments, specifically designed for segmentation tasks but adapted for object detection in this study.

3. **Foggy Cityscapes**: This dataset is derived from Cityscapes and simulates foggy conditions, maintaining the same annotations, which allows for a direct comparison in their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pascal VOC**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., Schiele, B. (2016). *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 3213–3223.

- For **Foggy Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Sakaridis, C., Dai, D., Van Gool, L. (2018). *Semantic Foggy Scene Understanding with Synthetic Data*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 126(9), 973–992.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
