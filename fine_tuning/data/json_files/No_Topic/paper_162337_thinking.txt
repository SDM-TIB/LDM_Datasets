To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Formulations of Regression with Mixed Guidance" by Aubrey Gress and Ian Davidson, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experimental results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the datasets are summarized in **Table II**, which lists the datasets used in the experiments along with brief descriptions.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a random linear function with Gaussian noise. It serves as a controlled environment to test the proposed methods.

2. **Concrete Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its age and the proportions of its ingredients. The citation for this dataset is:
   > I.-C. Yeh, “Modeling of strength of high-performance concrete using artificial neural networks,” Cement and Concrete Research, vol. 28, no. 12, pp. 1797–1808, 1998.

3. **Housing Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict housing prices in Boston based on various features of the houses and their neighborhoods. The citation for this dataset is:
   > D. Harrison and D. L. Rubinfeld, “Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air,” Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 81–102, 1978.

4. **Fruit Fly Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the developmental stage of fruit fly embryos from images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > T. Kazmar, E. Kvon, A. Stark, and C. Lampert, “Drosophila embryo stage annotation using label propagation,” in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2013, pp. 1089–1096.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation for each dataset, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
