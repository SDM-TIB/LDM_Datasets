To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond accuracy: quantifying trial-by-trial behaviour of CNNs and humans by measuring error consistency" by Robert Geirhos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on error consistency, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for quantitative analyses in comparing decision-making strategies, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section**.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the experimental setup and mention that they tested both human observers and various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using specific stimuli. They refer to the **ImageNet dataset** as a baseline for their experiments. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors analyze the performance of different CNN models trained on ImageNet, but they do not introduce new datasets here.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

- **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the relevant dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections to identify datasets.
2. Identify the **ImageNet dataset** as the primary dataset used in the study.
3. Locate the full citation for the ImageNet dataset in the references section.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary dataset information from the paper.
