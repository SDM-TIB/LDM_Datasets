To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FireRisk: A Remote Sensing Dataset for Fire Risk Assessment with Benchmarks Using Supervised and Self-supervised Learning" by Shuchang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces the **FireRisk dataset**, which consists of 91,872 labeled images for fire risk assessment. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will examine **section III (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they constructed. Here, I will find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **FireRisk Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 91,872 labeled images categorized into 7 fire risk classes. The authors explain how the dataset was constructed using fire risk labels from the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) raster dataset and remote sensing images from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP).

2. **UnlabelledNAIP Dataset**: This dataset consists of 199,976 unlabelled remote sensing images collected from the NAIP project, which is used for pre-training self-supervised learning models.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) raster dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gregory K Dillon and Julie W Gilbertson-Day. *Wildfire hazard potential for the United States (270-m), version 2020*. 2020.

- For the **National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP)**, the citation is:
  > Aaron E Maxwell, Timothy A Warner, Brian C Vanderbilt, and Christopher A Ramezan. *Land cover classification and feature extraction from national agriculture imagery program (NAIP) orthoimagery: A review*. Photogrammetric Engineering & Remote Sensing, 83(11):737â€“747, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
