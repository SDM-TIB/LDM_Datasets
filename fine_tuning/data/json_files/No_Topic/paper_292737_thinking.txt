To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Clinical Event Sequence Prediction through Personalized Online Adaptive Learning" by Jeong Min Lee and Milos Hauskrecht, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of clinical event sequences derived from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which suggests that a dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenge of patient-specific variability in clinical sequences, hinting at the use of real-world data. I will look for specific dataset names or references.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiment setup. They mention extracting data from the **MIMIC-3 Database**, which is a publicly available dataset of electronic health records for ICU patients. This is a key dataset for their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-3 Database. The citation is:

- **MIMIC-3 Database**: 
  > Alistair EW Johnson et al. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3:160035, 2016.

Additionally, I will ensure that I note any other datasets mentioned in the paper, but it appears that MIMIC-3 is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
