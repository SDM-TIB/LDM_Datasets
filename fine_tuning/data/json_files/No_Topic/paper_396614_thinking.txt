To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-free Classifier Injection for Zero-Shot Classification" by Anders Christensen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark ZSL datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of zero-shot learning and mention the need for datasets but do not specify any names yet. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more details.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setting)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluating their framework ICIS. They mention three datasets:

1. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: This dataset is used for fine-grained bird classification and consists of 200 categories. The authors specify that they split the classes into 150 seen and 50 unseen classes.

2. **AWA2 (Animals with Attributes 2)**: This dataset contains 50 different animal classes, with 40 seen and 10 unseen classes. It is a coarse-grained classification dataset.

3. **SUN (Scene Understanding)**: This dataset consists of 717 indoor and outdoor scene categories, with 645 classes as seen and 72 as unseen.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CUB**:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. J. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. 

- For **AWA2**:
  > Xian, Y., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2018). *Zero-Shot Learning - A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly*. IEEE PAMI.

- For **SUN**:
  > Patterson, G., Xu, C., Su, H., & Hays, J. (2014). *The SUN Attribute Database: Beyond Categories for Deeper Scene Understanding*. IJCV.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
