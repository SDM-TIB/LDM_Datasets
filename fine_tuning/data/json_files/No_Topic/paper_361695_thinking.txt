To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributionally Robust Domain Adaptation" by Akram S. Awad and George K. Atia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **methodology and results sections** for any mentions of datasets used in the experiments. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their experimental setup or when presenting results.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for the **References section** of the paper, where the authors typically provide full citations for the datasets they used. If a dataset is derived from a previously published work, I will cite the original source.

For example, if the paper mentions using the "MNIST dataset," I would look for its citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and well-organized for future reference or processing.
