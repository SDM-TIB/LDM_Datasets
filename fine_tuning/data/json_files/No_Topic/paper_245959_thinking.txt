To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Generative Adversarial Networks Analysis for Predicting Photographers’ Retouching" by Marc Bickel, Samuel Dubuis, and Sébastien Gachoud, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their goal of using deep learning methods, particularly GANs, to mimic artists' retouching. However, I need to look for specific datasets mentioned in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation section**, particularly subsection 3.1, where the authors describe the dataset they used. Here, they mention the **fiVEK dataset**, which consists of 5,000 raw pictures taken by photographers and 25,000 edited pictures by artists using Adobe Lightroom, with 5,000 pictures per artist. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **baseline methods section** (3.2) to see if any additional datasets are referenced. The authors mention that their baseline methods were created following the work of Bychkovsky et al. (2011), which indicates that they are using a dataset related to photographic tonal adjustments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **fiVEK dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bychkovsky, V., Paris, S., Chan, E., Durand, F. (2011). *Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input/output image pairs*. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Colorado Springs, CO, June 2011.

2. The authors also reference the original paper for the CycleGAN model, which is:
   > Zhu, J.Y., Park, T., Isola, P., Efros, A.A. (2017). *Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
