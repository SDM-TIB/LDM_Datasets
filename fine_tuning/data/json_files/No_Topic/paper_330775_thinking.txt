To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Social Media Images for Building Function Classification" by Eike Jens Hoffmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "culturally diverse social media dataset from Flickr with more than 28 million images," indicating that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. They mention two datasets:

1. **Google Street View Dataset**: This dataset consists of 43,392 building facade images, categorized into three classes: commercial, residential, and other. The authors detail the filtering process that refines this dataset to 7,698 images.

2. **Flickr Social Media Dataset**: This dataset contains 28,818,438 images collected from 42 cities worldwide. The authors explain how they queried the Flickr API to gather these images and provide a breakdown of the number of images per city.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from existing sources (Google Street View and Flickr), I will cite them accordingly:

- For the **Google Street View Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Google. *Google Street View*. Available at: https://www.google.com/streetview/

- For the **Flickr Social Media Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Flickr. *Flickr API Documentation*. Available at: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
