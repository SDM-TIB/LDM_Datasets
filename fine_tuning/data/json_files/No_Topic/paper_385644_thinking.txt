To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Uplink and Downlink Resource Allocation Towards Energy-efficient Transmission for URLLC" by Kang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) or any section that discusses the methodology in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their outcomes. This can provide additional context about the datasets and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear format, ready for further processing or review.
