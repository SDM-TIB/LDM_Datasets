To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pilgrims Face Recognition Dataset – HUFRD" by Salah A. Aly, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **Hajj and Umrah facial dataset**, which is referred to as HUFRD. This indicates that I should focus on this dataset for further details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the author discusses the challenges faced during the Hajj and Umrah seasons, including the need for an efficient monitoring system for missing persons. The introduction reiterates the importance of the HUFRD dataset for face recognition and detection algorithms, confirming its significance.

In the **section II (Pilgrims Face Recognition Dataset)**, the author provides detailed information about the HUFRD dataset. It contains hundreds of images of pilgrims taken during the 2011-2012 Hajj and Umrah seasons, with images sourced from over 25 countries. Each individual in the dataset has between 6 to 15 images, showcasing various poses and expressions. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset's composition and purpose.

I will also look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The HUFRD dataset is primarily discussed throughout the paper, but I will also note other datasets mentioned in the context of face recognition.

The references include:
- For the **Hajj and Umrah facial dataset (HUFRD)**, the citation is:
  > Salah A. Aly. *Pilgrims Face Recognition Dataset – HUFRD*. Center of Research Excellence in Hajj and Umrah (HajjCore), College of Computers and Information Systems, Umm Al-Qura University, Makkah, KSA.

Additionally, the paper references other datasets like the **ORL Dataset**, **Japanese Dataset**, **UMIST Dataset**, **FERET Dataset**, and others. I will extract their citations as well:

- For the **ORL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. *The ORL Database of Faces*. Available: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html.

- For the **Japanese Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kyushu University Psychology Department. *The Japanese Female Facial Expression (JAFFE) Database*. Available: http://www.kasrl.org/jaffe.html.

- For the **UMIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The University of Sheffield. *The UMIST Face Database*. Available: http://www.shefﬁeld.ac.uk/eee/research/iel/research/face.

- For the **FERET Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Face Recognition Technology (FERET) dataset, collected between 1993 and 1996 by DARPA.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets for future reference or analysis.
