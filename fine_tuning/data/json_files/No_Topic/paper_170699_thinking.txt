To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical inference on random dot product graphs: a survey" by Avanti Athreya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract discusses the random dot product graph (RDPG) and its applications, which may hint at specific datasets used for examples or experiments.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will look through the **methods**, **experiments**, and **applications** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of any datasets used in the research. I will pay special attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets or data sources.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: As I read through the relevant sections, I will note down any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for their experiments or analyses, I will record the name, purpose, and any relevant details about the dataset (e.g., size, type of data).

4. **Consulting the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

5. **Documenting Datasets**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name of the dataset**: The title or name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
   - **Citation**: The full citation as found in the References section.

6. **Final Review**: Once I have compiled the information for all datasets, I will review it to ensure accuracy and completeness. This includes verifying that all citations are correctly formatted and that the descriptions accurately reflect the content of the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract and document the datasets from the paper thoroughly and accurately, providing a clear reference for future readers and researchers.
