To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a parallel corpus of Portuguese and the Bantu language Emakhuwa of Mozambique" by Felermino D. M. A. Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a **Portuguese-Emakhuwa parallel corpus**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the corpus as containing **47,415 sentence pairs** with a total of **699,976 word tokens in Emakhuwa** and **877,595 word tokens in Portuguese**. The sources of the data include the **Jehovah’s Witness website**, the **African Story Book website**, the **Universal Declaration of Human Rights**, and **Mozambican legal documents**. This section is crucial as it outlines the composition and origin of the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several sources that contributed to the dataset, which I need to document properly.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Portuguese-Emakhuwa Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is a collection of texts from various sources, including the Jehovah’s Witness website and the African Story Book website. It contains 47,415 sentence pairs, with a total of 699,976 word tokens in Emakhuwa and 877,595 word tokens in Portuguese.

For the citation of the dataset, I will refer to the paper itself as it describes the creation of the dataset. The citation for the paper is:
> Felermino D. M. A. Ali, Andrew Caines, and Jaimito L. A. Malavi. *Towards a parallel corpus of Portuguese and the Bantu language Emakhuwa of Mozambique*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Location]. 

I will need to fill in the conference name, year, and location based on the actual publication details, which are not provided in the text.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
