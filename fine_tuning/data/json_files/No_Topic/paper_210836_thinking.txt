To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Actor-Advisor: Policy Gradient With Off-Policy Advice" by Hélène Plisnier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the Actor-Advisor architecture and its applications, but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction provides context about actor-critic algorithms but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention two environments used for their experiments: **Table** and **Five Rooms**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these environments to determine if they are publicly available datasets or custom environments created for the study.

In **Section 5.1 (Environments)**, the authors describe the **Table** environment as a continuous-states and discrete-actions environment where an agent must navigate to a charging station without falling off the table. They also describe the **Five Rooms** environment as a grid world divided into five rooms, which presents challenges for exploration. However, these environments appear to be custom setups rather than standard datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any related works or datasets are cited that could be relevant. The references include various foundational papers in reinforcement learning, but they do not specifically cite datasets.

Given that the environments described are not standard datasets but rather experimental setups created for the purpose of this research, I will note that there are no publicly available datasets extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
1. **Table Environment**: A custom environment for reinforcement learning experiments.
2. **Five Rooms Environment**: Another custom environment for testing transfer learning.

Since these are not standard datasets, I will not provide citations for them. Instead, I will document that the paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets, focusing on the custom environments created for their experiments.
