To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuSurf: On-Surface Priors for Neural Surface Reconstruction from Sparse Input Views" by Han Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with the **DTU** and **BlendedMVS** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted surface reconstruction experiments on the **DTU dataset** and the **BlendedMVS dataset**. They describe the DTU dataset as containing multiple scans with varying numbers of images per scan, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **related work and methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more context about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **DTU Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jensen, R., Dahl, A., Vogiatzis, G., Tola, E., & Aanæs, H. (2014). Large Scale Multi-view Stereopsis Evaluation. In *2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 406–413.

2. **BlendedMVS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yao, Y., Luo, Z., Li, S., Zhang, J., Ren, Y., Zhou, L., Fang, T., & Quan, L. (2020). BlendedMVS: A Large-scale Dataset for Generalized Multi-view Stereo Networks. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
