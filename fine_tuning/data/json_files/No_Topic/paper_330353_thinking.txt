To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Shapley Value in Machine Learning" by Benedek Rozemberczki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing applications** of the Shapley value in machine learning. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of the Shapley value, including feature selection, explainability, data valuation, and more. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these contexts.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Machine Learning and the Shapley Value)**, which outlines different application areas. Here, I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses. For instance, if the authors mention datasets used for feature selection or data valuation, I will note those down.

As I read through the paper, I will pay particular attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or their characteristics. For example, if there is a table that lists datasets alongside their applications or results, I will extract that information.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "CIFAR-10" in the context of data valuation, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
