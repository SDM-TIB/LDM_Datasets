To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Study on Accuracy, Miscalibration, and Popularity Bias in Recommendations" by Dominik Kowald et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors use data from **Last.fm**, **MovieLens**, and **MyAnimeList**, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest. I will note these names for further exploration.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Method)**, specifically **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their study. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Last.fm (LFM)**: The dataset is based on the LFM-1b dataset and contains listening records from the music streaming platform Last.fm. It includes genre information indexed with the 20 main genres from the AllMusic database.

2. **MovieLens (ML)**: This dataset is based on the ML-1M dataset provided by the University of Minnesota and contains genre information for movies, with 18 distinct genres.

3. **MyAnimeList (MAL)**: This dataset is based on a recommender systems challenge dataset provided by Kaggle and includes genre information for each anime, with 44 distinct genres.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Last.fm (LFM)**, the citation is:
  > Schedl, M. (2016). The LFM-1b dataset for music retrieval and recommendation. In Proceedings of the 2016 ACM on International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR), pp. 103–110.

- For **MovieLens (ML)**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 19:1–19:19.

- For **MyAnimeList (MAL)**, the citation is:
  > Kaggle. (n.d.). Anime Recommendations Database. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, their descriptions, and the corresponding citations. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use.
