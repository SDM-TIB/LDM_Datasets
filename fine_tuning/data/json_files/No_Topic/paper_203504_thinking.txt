To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A novel approach for venue recommendation using cross-domain techniques" by Pablo Sánchez and Alejandro Bellogín, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of location-based social networks (LBSNs) and mention that they will be using a dataset from Foursquare. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. They mention that they performed their experiments using the global-scale check-in dataset from Foursquare, which consists of over 33 million check-ins. They also describe how they created a temporal split for their training and testing phases.

The specific dataset mentioned is:
- **Foursquare Check-in Dataset**: This dataset contains over 33 million check-ins, and the authors created a temporal split for their experiments, using 6 months of data for training and 1 month for testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Foursquare dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being made public by the authors of previous works, specifically citing the papers that describe the dataset.

The citation for the Foursquare dataset is:
> Yang, D., Zhang, D., Chen, L., & Qu, B. (2015). NationTelescope: Monitoring and visualizing large-scale collective behavior in LBSNs. *Journal of Network and Computer Applications*, 55, 170-180.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
