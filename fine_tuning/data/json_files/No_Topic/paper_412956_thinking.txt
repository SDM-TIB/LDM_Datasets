To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastPart: Over-Parameterized Stochastic Gradient Descent for Sparse optimisation on Measures" by Yohann De Castro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. This section often describes the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I would document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Penn Action Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing video clips for action recognition, with annotations for various actions.
- **Full Citation**: Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented and properly cited, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
