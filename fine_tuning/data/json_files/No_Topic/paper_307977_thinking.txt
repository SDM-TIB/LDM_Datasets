To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Primary-Auxiliary Model Scheduling Based Estimation of the Vertical Wheel Force in a Full Vehicle System" by Xueke Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on a full vehicle system to estimate the vertical wheel force. I will look for specific datasets related to these experiments.

In the **experimental validation section**, the authors describe the data collected from various working conditions. They mention that they collected data from 58 working conditions, with over 2 Ã— 10^4 data samples at a sampling frequency of 512 Hz. This indicates that there is a substantial dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

I will also check the **figures and tables** for any additional information regarding the datasets. For instance, the paper includes figures showing the locations of sensors and the types of road profiles used during testing, which may provide context for the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Vertical Wheel Force Dataset**: This dataset consists of measurements collected from a wheel force transducer during various driving conditions. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be original data collected for this study.

2. **Accelerometer Data**: The paper mentions that accelerometer data was collected at various positions on the vehicle. Again, this data is original to the study and does not have an external citation.

3. **Road Load Data Acquisition (RLDA) Dataset**: The authors refer to data collected during RLDA testing campaigns, but they do not cite a specific dataset. This may refer to standard practices in the field rather than a specific dataset.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented, including any relevant details about the data collection process, the types of measurements taken, and the context in which the data was used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
