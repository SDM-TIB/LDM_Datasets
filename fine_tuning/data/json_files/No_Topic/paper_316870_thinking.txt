To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indian urban workers’ labour market transitions" by Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses a panel dataset constructed from the Indian Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for the period 2017–18 to 2019–20. This suggests that the PLFS is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **data section (Section 3)**, where the author discusses the PLFS in detail. The paper mentions that the PLFS is a quarterly survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of the Government of India, which provides data on employment issues. The author also notes that the study uses data from three annual microdata releases of the PLFS: 2017–18, 2018–19, and 2019–20.

In this section, I will specifically look for any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The author discusses the challenges of merging data from different years due to changes in sampling unit identifiers, which reinforces the importance of the PLFS dataset for this research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PLFS dataset. The citation for the PLFS is typically provided in the context of its documentation or methodology. In this case, the relevant citation is:

> National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). *Periodic Labour Force Survey: Instructions to field staff, vol I*. Government of India, 2016.

Since the PLFS is the primary dataset used in this research, I will ensure to include it in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PLFS dataset. This will allow for clear identification and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

In conclusion, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)**, and its full citation is provided above. I will compile this information for further processing or review.
