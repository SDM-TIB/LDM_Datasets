To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Evaluation on Event Reasoning of Large Language Models" by Zhengwei Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a novel benchmark called **EV2** for evaluating event reasoning, which suggests that this benchmark may be a dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Benchmark Construction)**. In this section, the authors describe how they constructed the EV2 benchmark, which includes details about the datasets used for evaluation. 

Upon reviewing section 3, I will note that the authors mention several existing datasets that are compared with their benchmark. The datasets listed include:
