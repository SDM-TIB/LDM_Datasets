To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UFD-PRiME: Unsupervised Joint Learning of Optical Flow and Stereo Depth through Pixel-Level Rigid Motion Estimation" by Shuai Yuan and Carlo Tomasi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of optical flow and stereo depth in various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **experiments section** is crucial, as it typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Upon reaching **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, I find that the authors explicitly state they experimented on the **KITTI datasets**. This is a clear indication that I have identified a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will gather the full citation for the KITTI dataset from the **References section**. The relevant citations are:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1231â€“1237, 2013.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The paper mentions that the models were trained on KITTI raw frames (25.2k samples) and fine-tuned on KITTI multi-view extensions (6.7k samples). The validation was done using KITTI-2015 and 2012 training sets.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset identified.
