To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Voltage Control for Unbalanced Distribution Networks Using Projected Newton Method" by Rui Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may hint at the datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or case studies section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the research. In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of numerical simulations or case studies.

In the **case study section**, I will pay attention to any references to datasets such as the "modified IEEE 123-bus test case" and the "IEEE 8500-node test feeder." These are likely to be the datasets used for the numerical simulations described in the paper.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. For example, the IEEE test feeders are commonly referenced in the literature, and I will ensure to find the correct citation format for each.

For the "modified IEEE 123-bus test case," I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe this dataset. Similarly, for the "IEEE 8500-node test feeder," I will find the appropriate citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citation is included for each one.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
