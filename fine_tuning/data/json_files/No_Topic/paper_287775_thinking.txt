To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Half-Gain Tuning for Active Disturbance Rejection Control" by Gernot Herbst et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and the datasets used.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections often detail the data used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant publication details.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets directly, I may need to conduct a brief search for the datasets online to find their original sources and citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further processing.
