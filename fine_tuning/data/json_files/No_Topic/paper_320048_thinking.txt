To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AIM: Automatic Interaction Machine for Click-Through Rate Prediction" by Chenxu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three large-scale datasets (two public benchmarks, one private dataset)," indicating that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset was released for a CTR prediction contest on Kaggle. It consists of 40 million instances and 24 features, with a positive ratio of 0.17.

2. **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset contains one month of click logs with billions of data samples. The authors specify that they used "data 6-12" for training and validation and "day-13" for evaluation. It has 100 million instances and 39 features, with a positive ratio of 0.50.

3. **Huawei Dataset**: This is a private dataset collected from an app recommendation scenario, containing 10 feature fields and 300 million instances, with a positive ratio of 0.07.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are either public or proprietary, they may not have formal citations like traditional academic papers. Instead, I will note the sources provided in the paper:

- For the **Avazu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu CTR Prediction Dataset*. Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.

- For the **Criteo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Click Logs Dataset*. Available at: http://labs.criteo.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/.

- The **Huawei Dataset** does not have a formal citation since it is a private dataset, but I will note that it was collected from Huawei's app recommendation service.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
