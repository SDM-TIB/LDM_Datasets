To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforced Attention for Few-Shot Learning and Beyond" by Jie Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 images of size 84x84, selected from ImageNet, divided into 64 training classes, 16 validation classes, and 20 test classes. Each class has 600 images.

2. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images of size 84x84 from 200 classes. The authors mention that they randomly divide it into 100 training classes, 50 validation classes, and 50 test classes.

3. **CIFAR10/100**: This dataset comprises 60,000 images from 10 classes (CIFAR10) and 100 classes (CIFAR100), with each image sized at 32x32. The authors note that they split the original training set into 40,000 training samples and 10,000 validation samples.

4. **STL-10**: This dataset contains 10 classes, where each class has 500 training images and 800 test images of size 96x96. The authors also mention that they split the original training data into training and validation sets by a ratio of 4:1.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Sachin Ravi and Hugo Larochelle. *Optimization as a model for few-shot learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

- For **CIFAR10/100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215â€“223, 2011.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
