To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BDD4BNN: A BDD-based Quantitative Analysis Framework for Binarized Neural Networks" by Yedi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their properties, as these often contain concise information about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
- The name of the dataset
- A brief description of the dataset
- The full citation for the dataset

This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete. After compiling the dataset information, I will prepare it for any further processing or review as needed.
