To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing apples to apples - Using a modular and adaptable analysis pipeline to compare slow cerebral rhythms across heterogeneous datasets" by Robin Gutzen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a software implementation for analyzing slow wave characteristics across multiple datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.5 (Key Resources Table)**, which typically lists datasets and their sources. Here, I will find specific datasets mentioned along with their identifiers. The authors reference five datasets from the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph platform, which are:

1. **Mouse ECoG (WBS)**: This dataset pertains to Williams Beuren Syndrome in adult male mice.
2. **Mouse ECoG (FXS)**: This dataset involves Fragile X Syndrome in adult male mice.
3. **Mouse ECoG (Propagation modes)**: This dataset examines propagation modes of cortical slow waves across different anesthesia levels in adult male C57BL/6J mice.
4. **Wide-field calcium imaging (ketamine)**: This dataset includes wide-field calcium imaging recordings of the right cortical hemisphere of GCaMP6f mice under ketamine anesthesia.
5. **Wide-field calcium imaging (isoflurane)**: This dataset involves wide-field calcium imaging recordings of the right cortical hemisphere of GCaMP6f mice under isoflurane anesthesia.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the **Key Resources Table**:

- For **Mouse ECoG (WBS)**, the citation is:

- For **Mouse ECoG (FXS)**, the citation is:

- For **Mouse ECoG (Propagation modes)**, the citation is:

- For **Wide-field calcium imaging (ketamine)**, the citation is:
  > Resta, F., Allegra Mascaro, A. L., & Pavone, F. (2020). *Study of Slow Waves (SWs) propagation through wide-field calcium imaging of the right cortical hemisphere of GCaMP6f mice (v2)*. EBRAINS. https://doi.org/10.25493/QFZK-FXS

- For **Wide-field calcium imaging (isoflurane)**, the citation is:
  > Resta, F., Allegra Mascaro, A. L., & Pavone, F. (2020). *Wide-field calcium imaging of the right cortical hemisphere of GCaMP6f mice at different anesthesia levels*. EBRAINS. https://doi.org/10.25493/XJR8-QCA

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
