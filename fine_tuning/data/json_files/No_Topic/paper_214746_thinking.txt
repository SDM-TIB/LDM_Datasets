To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAIN: Multi-Attention Instance Network for Video Segmentation" by Juan León Alcázar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Youtube-VOS dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this section, the authors clearly state that they used:

1. **Youtube-VOS**: This dataset is described as the first large-scale video segmentation dataset consisting of 4453 high-quality hand-labeled videos, split into training, validation, and test sets. The authors mention that it provides ground-truth segmentation for the first frame in any set.

2. **DAVIS-17**: This dataset is mentioned as a complementary dataset consisting of 60 high-quality videos for training and 30 for validation. It is noted that this dataset is smaller than Youtube-VOS but is densely annotated.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. 

For **Youtube-VOS**, the citation is:
> Xu, N., Yang, L., Fan, Y., Yue, D., Liang, Y., Yang, J., & Huang, T. (2018). *Youtube-vos: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.03327.

For **DAVIS-17**, the citation is:
> Pont-Tuset, J., Perazzi, F., Caelles, S., Arbeláez, P., Sorkine-Hornung, A., & Van Gool, L. (2017). *The 2017 davis challenge on video object segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.00675.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
