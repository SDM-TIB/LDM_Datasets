To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROS georegistration: Aerial Multi-spectral Image Simulator for the Robot Operating System" by Andrew R. Willis, Kevin Brink, and Kathleen Dipple, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the software package downloads multi-spectral images from the Google Earth Engine database, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **methodology** and **results** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe the Google Earth Engine client, which aggregates and downloads image data. They mention several datasets available through Google Earth Engine, including:

1. **Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data**: This dataset is highlighted as a source for generating realistic SAR imagery, which is crucial for the research.

2. **Google Earth EO satellite data**: The authors mention using EO satellite data from Google Earth for their experiments, specifically for a terrain model.

In the **results** section, the authors provide details about the specific data they used, including the resolution and the geographic area covered. They mention that they downloaded EO images from 100 high-quality tiles and extracted Sentinel-1 SAR data for the same region.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the Google Earth Engine and its datasets, but it does not provide a specific citation for the Earth Engine itself. However, I can cite the relevant datasets as follows:

- For **Sentinel-1 SAR data**, the citation is:
  > European Space Agency. *Sentinel-1: A New Era for Radar Earth Observation*. Available at: https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1

- For **Google Earth Engine datasets**, the citation is:
  > Google. *Google Earth Engine*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
