To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdapterDrop: On the Efficiency of Adapters in Transformers" by Andreas Rücklé et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of adapters in transformer models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various works related to adapters and their applications in NLP tasks, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** and look for any subsection that discusses datasets. I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used in their experiments. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **GLUE benchmark** for evaluating their methods. The GLUE benchmark is a collection of nine different tasks for evaluating natural language understanding systems. This is a significant dataset for the NLP community.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the GLUE benchmark. The relevant citation is:

- For the **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP, pages 353–355, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the GLUE benchmark.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GLUE benchmark as required.
