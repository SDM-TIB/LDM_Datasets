To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Complementary consistency semi-supervised learning for 3D left atrial image segmentation" by Hejun Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method has been validated on two public datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific dataset names in the following sections.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset and pre-processing)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of images, and any preprocessing steps.

Upon reviewing section 3.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **LA Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the 2018 Atrial Segmentation Challenge and consists of 154 3D LGE-MRIs from 60 diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients. The authors provide specific details about the resolution and segmentation labels.

2. **Pancreas-CT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 82 3D contrast-enhanced CT scans from 53 male and 27 female patients. The authors also mention the preprocessing steps taken for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **LA Dataset**, the citation is:
> Xiong, Z., Xia, Q., Hu, Z., Huang, N., Bian, C., Zheng, Y., Vesal, S., Ravikumar, N., Maier, A., Yang, X. (2021). A global benchmark of algorithms for segmenting the left atrium from late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. *Medical Image Analysis*, 67, 101832. doi:10.1016/j.media.2020.101832.

For the **Pancreas-CT Dataset**, the citation is:
> Clark, K., Vendt, B., Smith, K., Freymann, J., Kirby, J., Koppel, P., Moore, S., Phillips, S., Maffitt, D., Pringle, M., et al. (2013). The cancer imaging archive (TCIA): maintaining and operating a public information repository. *Journal of Digital Imaging*, 26(6), 1045-1057. doi:10.1007/s10278-013-9622-7.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **LA Dataset** - Citation: Xiong et al. (2021).
2. **Pancreas-CT Dataset** - Citation: Clark et al. (2013).

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the research paper.
