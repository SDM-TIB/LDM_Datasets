To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learning for Multi-Omics: A Survey" by Sina Tabakhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** (particularly section 6, which is dedicated to multi-omics datasets). The abstract mentions the importance of multi-omics data for healthcare applications, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6.1 (Datasets description)**, where the authors provide a brief overview of important multi-omics datasets. Here, I will identify the datasets mentioned, their descriptions, and any relevant details that indicate their significance or usage in the context of the paper.

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: This dataset is described as having processed over 20,000 patients across 33 cancer types, providing a wealth of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. 

2. **Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)**: This resource is noted for its role in assigning functional information to sets of genes, aiding in the biological interpretation of genomic data.

3. **Human Protein Atlas (HPA)**: This dataset focuses on providing transcriptomics and proteomics data for human tissue expression profiles.

4. **Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)**: This database contains information on metabolites and their roles in human health and disease.

5. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: This resource provides structural data for proteins, which is crucial for understanding their functions.

6. **NCI-60**: This dataset consists of 60 human tumor cell lines used for anticancer drug screening.

After identifying these datasets, I will then look for the **full citations** for each dataset in the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete references for each dataset.

The citations I will extract include:

- For **TCGA**:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *Integrated genomic analyses of ovarian carcinoma*. Nature, 2011.

- For **KEGG**:
  > Kanehisa, M., & Goto, S. *KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes*. Nucleic Acids Research, 2000.

- For **HPA**:
  > UhlÃ©n, M., et al. *Tissue-based map of the human proteome*. Science, 2015.

- For **HMDB**:
  > Wishart, D. S., et al. *HMDB 4.0: the human metabolome database for 2018*. Nucleic Acids Research, 2018.

- For **PDB**:
  > Berman, H. M., et al. *Protein Data Bank (PDB): database of three-dimensional structural information of biological macromolecules*. Acta Crystallographica Section D, 1998.

- For **NCI-60**:
  > Shoemaker, R. H. *The NCI60 human tumour cell line anticancer drug screen*. Nature Reviews Cancer, 2006.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that the extracted data is organized and ready for further analysis or presentation.
