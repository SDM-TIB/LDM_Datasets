To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A multi-label classification method using a hierarchical and transparent representation for paper-reviewer recommendation" by Dong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset from the ACM Digital Library, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments and Evaluations)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that they obtained a dataset consisting of **931,707 computer science papers** from the ACM Digital Library, which includes key information such as authors, content, and research labels. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of unique authors and the specific papers used for testing.

The authors specify that they retained **22,575 unique authors** who have at least 15 publications and that **13,449 papers published in 2017** were used as the testing data. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the ACM Digital Library, I will note that the citation for the dataset is essentially the ACM Digital Library itself, as it is the source of the data.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
> ACM Digital Library. *ACM Digital Library: A comprehensive collection of full-text articles and bibliographic records covering the fields of computing and information technology*. Available at: https://dl.acm.org/

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its source. I will now compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered, ensuring to include the full citation for the ACM Digital Library as the dataset source.
