To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DINF: Dynamic Instance Noise Filter for Occluded Pedestrian Detection" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two pedestrian datasets: **CrowdHuman** and **CityPersons**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset and Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find specific information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of images they contain.

1. **CrowdHuman Dataset**: The authors describe it as a dataset with 22.64 objects per image, including heavily overlapping objects. They mention that it is divided into training, validation, and testing sets with 15,000, 4,370, and 5,000 images, respectively.

2. **CityPersons Dataset**: This dataset is noted to contain 5,000 images, with a specific focus on the reasonable subset, which includes 2,975 images for training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CrowdHuman Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shao, S., Zhao, Z., Li, B., Xiao, T., Yu, G., Zhang, X., Sun, J. (2018). *CrowdHuman: A Benchmark for Detecting Human in a Crowd*. CoRR abs/1805.00123. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00123.

- For the **CityPersons Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Benenson, R., Schiele, B. (2017). *CityPersons: A Diverse Dataset for Pedestrian Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4457â€“4465. doi:10.1109/CVPR.2017.474.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
