To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-phase protein folding optimization on a three-dimensional AB off-lattice model" by Borko Bošković and Janez Brest, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or specific amino acid sequences used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for testing their algorithm. Here, they mention using **18 real peptide sequences from the Protein Data Bank** and **5 well-known artificial Fibonacci sequences**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to document.

I will then look for a **table or list** that details these sequences, which is typically included in the experiments section. In this case, I find **Table 2**, which summarizes the amino acid sequences used in the experiments. Each sequence is labeled and has an associated length, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will extract the relevant information for each dataset:

1. **Real Peptide Sequences**: The paper lists 18 sequences, each with a unique identifier (e.g., 1BXP, 1CB3) and their lengths. I will note down these identifiers and their corresponding lengths.

2. **Fibonacci Sequences**: The paper also mentions 5 artificial Fibonacci sequences labeled F13, F21, F34, F55, and F89. I will document these as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the real peptide sequences, the authors refer to the **Protein Data Bank** as the source, which is a well-known repository for protein sequences and structures. I will note this as the citation for the real peptide sequences.

For the Fibonacci sequences, since they are standard sequences used in computational studies, I may not need a specific citation, but I will mention their common usage in the context of algorithm testing.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. The citations will be formatted appropriately to reflect their sources.

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or analysis.
