To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning an Optimally Reduced Formulation of OPF through Meta-optimization" by Alex Robson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental analysis sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors have made generated DC- and AC-OPF samples publicly available, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets. In the **Methods section**, particularly in the subsection titled **Input Sample Generation**, the authors describe how they generated samples for DC-OPF and AC-OPF problems. They mention that for DC-OPF, they produced 10,000 samples by varying nodal load active power and other parameters, while for AC-OPF, they generated 1,000 samples with additional parameters.

The paper also provides links to the datasets in the **Conclusion section**, where they state that the generated samples and their code are publicly available on GitHub. This is crucial for obtaining the full citations for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **DC-OPF Samples**: The authors generated 10,000 samples by varying nodal load active power and other parameters. This dataset is crucial for their experiments and is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper.

2. **AC-OPF Samples**: The authors generated 1,000 samples for AC-OPF cases, which include additional parameters like reactive power and line resistance.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section. The relevant citations are:

- For the DC-OPF samples, the citation is:
  > S. Babaeinejadsarookolaee, A. Birchfield, R. D. Christie, et al. *The Power Grid Library for Benchmarking AC Optimal Power Flow Algorithms*. arXiv e-prints (2019) arXiv:1908.02788.

- For the AC-OPF samples, the same citation applies since both datasets are derived from the same library.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
