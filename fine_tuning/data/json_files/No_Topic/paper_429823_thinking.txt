To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BadPart: Unified Black-box Adversarial Patch Attacks against Pixel-wise Regression Tasks" by Zhiyuan Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the BADPART attack on pixel-wise regression tasks, but it does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions that the authors focus on monocular depth estimation (MDE) and optical flow estimation (OFE) tasks, which may lead to specific datasets being referenced later.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the tasks and models used for evaluation. Here, they mention that the MDE models were trained on the **KITTI depth prediction dataset** and the OFE models were trained on the **KITTI flow 2015 dataset**. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **KITTI depth prediction dataset**, the citation is:
  > Uhrig, J., Schneider, N., Schneider, L., Franke, U., Brox, T., and Geiger, A. *Sparsity invariant CNNs*. In International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), 2017.

- For the **KITTI flow 2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, M., Heipke, C., and Geiger, A. *Joint 3D estimation of vehicles and scene flow*. In ISPRS Workshop on Image Sequence Analysis (ISA), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **KITTI depth prediction dataset** with the citation provided above.
2. **KITTI flow 2015 dataset** with the citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
