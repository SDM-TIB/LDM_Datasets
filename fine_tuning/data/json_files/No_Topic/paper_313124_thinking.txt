To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression" by Vinit Ravishankar and Anders Søgaard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of positional encodings on multilingual language models and reference previous works that may have utilized specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or corpora used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors mention using two bilingual corpora: 

1. **Bible Corpus**: This corpus consists of the English easy-to-read Bible as the training split and the KJV Bible as validation.
2. **Wikipedia Corpus**: This corpus uses the English Wikipedia as the training split and Common Crawl as validation.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of their experiments or evaluations, particularly in relation to the methods they are testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **Bible Corpus**, the citation is:
> Dufter, P., & Schütze, H. (2021). Identifying Necessary Elements for BERT’s Multilinguality. arXiv:2005.00396 [cs].

For the **Wikipedia Corpus**, the citation is:
> Wolf, T., Debut, L., Sanh, V., Chaumond, J., Delangue, C., Moi, A., ... & Rush, A. M. (2020). Transformers: State-of-the-art natural language processing. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, pages 38–45, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
