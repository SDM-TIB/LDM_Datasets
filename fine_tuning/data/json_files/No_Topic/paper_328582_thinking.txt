To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capture Agent Free Biosensing using Porous Silicon Arrays and Machine Learning" by Simon J. Ward et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may mention key datasets or experimental conditions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional biosensors and introduce their novel approach. They mention the use of an array of porous silicon sensors to classify and quantify proteins, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the proteins tested.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors present their findings. They specifically mention three proteins: **bovine serum albumin (BSA)**, **chicken ovalbumin**, and **avidin**. The results indicate that these proteins were tested at various concentrations, which implies that there are datasets associated with these experiments.

In the **methods section**, the authors detail the experimental setup, including the concentrations of the proteins used (2 g/L, 0.2 g/L, and 0.02 g/L) and the conditions under which the experiments were conducted (pH levels of 4 and 10). This section is crucial for understanding the specifics of the datasets, including how the data was collected and processed.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets:

1. **Protein Concentration Dataset**: This dataset includes measurements of the response of the porous silicon sensors to three proteins (BSA, chicken ovalbumin, and avidin) at three different concentrations (2 g/L, 0.2 g/L, and 0.02 g/L) in two different pH environments (4 and 10). The dataset is essential for understanding the sensor's performance and the classification accuracy achieved.

2. **Pore Size and Reflectance Measurements**: The authors provide data on the pore size distributions and reflectance spectra of the porous silicon films used in the experiments. This dataset is important for correlating the physical properties of the sensors with their performance in detecting the proteins.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset citations, but I will note the relevant references that support the methodology and findings:

- For the use of BSA, chicken ovalbumin, and avidin, the authors reference:
  > M. Y. Chen, M. J. Sailor, Anal. Chem. 2011, 83, 7186.

- The methodology for porous silicon fabrication and characterization is supported by:
  > M. J. Sailor, Porous Silicon in Practice: Preparation, Characterization and Applications, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2012.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and linked to its respective citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
