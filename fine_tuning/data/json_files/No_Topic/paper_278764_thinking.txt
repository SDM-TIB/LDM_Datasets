To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intervention Design for Effective Sim2Real Transfer" by Melissa Moziﬁan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will pay particular attention to sections that typically discuss datasets in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of simulation for robot training and mention the challenges of transferring learned behaviors to real-world applications. They do not explicitly name any datasets here, so I will continue to the methods and experiments sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors describe the tasks they tested their method on. They mention using the **Metaworld Benchmark Suite** for various manipulation tasks, which is a significant dataset in the context of reinforcement learning. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will also look for any specific details about the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention tasks such as **Reacher v1, Button Press v1, Window Open v1, and Window Close v1** from the Metaworld Benchmark Suite. These tasks are part of the dataset, and I need to ensure I capture the full context of the dataset's use.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Metaworld Benchmark Suite. The relevant citation is:

- For **Metaworld Benchmark Suite**:
  > Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2019). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL). arXiv: 1910.10897.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Metaworld Benchmark Suite and any specific tasks mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited for future reference.
