To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetic Algorithm based hyper-parameters optimization for transfer Convolutional Neural Network" by Chen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved a high classification precision on the **Cats and Dogs datasets**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **ASIRRA (Animal Species Image Recognition for Restricting Access)**: This dataset consists of over three million images of cats and dogs, provided by Microsoft Research. The authors specify that they used 0.1% for training and 99.9% for testing.

2. **Horses or Humans**: This dataset contains 500 images of horses and 527 images of humans, created by Laurence Moroney. The images are 300x300 pixels in 24-bit color.

3. **Rock Paper Scissors**: This dataset includes 2,892 images of hands in various poses for the game Rock/Paper/Scissors, also created by Laurence Moroney. Each image is 300x300 pixels in 24-bit color.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ASIRRA**, the citation is:
  > E. Jeremy, D. John, H. Jon, S. Jared. *Asirra: A CAPTCHA that Exploits Interest-Aligned Manual Image Categorization*. Proceedings of 14th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), 2007.

- For **Horses or Humans**, the citation is:
  > L. Moroney. *Horses Or Humans Dataset*. Available at: http://www.laurencemoroney.com/horses-or-humans-dataset/, 2019.

- For **Rock Paper Scissors**, the citation is:
  > L. Moroney. *Rock, Paper, Scissors Dataset*. Available at: http://www.laurencemoroney.com/rock-paper-scissors-dataset/, 2019.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
