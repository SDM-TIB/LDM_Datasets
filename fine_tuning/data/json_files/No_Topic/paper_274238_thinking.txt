To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational prediction of replication sites in DNA sequences using complex number representation" by Shubham Kundal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of computational prediction of origin of replication (ORI) and mention that experimental detection of ORI locations has been challenging. This section may hint at the datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, where the authors describe their computational approach. They mention applying their method to two bacterial genomes obtained from NCBI and 16 chromosomes of the eukaryote S. cerevisiae obtained from OriDB. This indicates that these two sources are datasets relevant to their study.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the application of their method to the mentioned datasets. They provide specific details about the predictions made for the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, which may include references to the datasets used.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to NCBI and OriDB as sources for their datasets, so I will look for the appropriate citations for these databases.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For the **NCBI database**:
   > NCBI, Resource Coordinators. “Database resources of the National Center for Biotechnology Information”, Nucleic Acids Research 44, D7-19 (2016).

2. For the **OriDB database**:
   > C. C. Siow et al. “OriDB, the DNA replication origin database updated and extended”, Nucleic Acids Research 40 (Database issue), D682-D686 (2012).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
