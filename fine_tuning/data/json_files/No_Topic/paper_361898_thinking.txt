To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Training with Complementary Labels: On the Benefit of Gradually Informative Attacks" by Jianan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on a range of benchmarked datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on **MNIST, Kuzushiji, CIFAR10, and SVHN datasets**. I will note down these datasets as they are explicitly stated.

I will also check the **related work section** and **methodology section** for any additional datasets that might be referenced indirectly or used in prior studies that the authors build upon. However, the primary datasets for their experiments seem to be listed in the experiments section.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

- For **Kuzushiji**, the citation is:
  > Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Asanobu Kitamoto, Alex Lamb, Kazuaki Yamamoto, and David Ha. *Deep learning for classical Japanese literature*. In arXiv, 2018.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. In arXiv, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NeurIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

With these citations collected, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names and their corresponding citations, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for review or further processing.
