To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Shape Models: Joint Text Recognition and Segmentation with Very Little Training Data" by Xinghua Lou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often contextualizes the datasets used in the research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ICDAR 2013**: This dataset is part of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) and includes two subsets: the ICDAR 2013 Segmentation dataset and the ICDAR 2013 Recognition dataset. The authors describe the challenges associated with real-world image recognition, emphasizing the dataset's focus on letters and single-word images.

2. **SVT (Street View Text)**: This dataset was harvested from Google Street View and is noted for its high variability and low resolution. The authors mention that it was created for lexicon-driven word recognition, although they used a general, large English lexicon in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ICDAR 2013**, the citation is:
  > Karatzas, D., Shafait, F., Uchida, S., Iwamura, M., Gomez i Bigorda, L., Robles Mestre, S., Mas, J., Fernandez Mota, D., Almazan Almazan, J., and de las Heras, L.-P. (2013). *ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition*. In Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2013 12th International Conference on, pages 1484–1493. IEEE.

- For **SVT**, the citation is:
  > Wang, K. and Belongie, S. (2010). *Word Spotting in the Wild*. Computer Vision–ECCV 2010, pages 591–604.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any further analysis or documentation.
