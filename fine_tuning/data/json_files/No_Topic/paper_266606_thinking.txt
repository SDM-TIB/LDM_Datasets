To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IMPi: An Interactive Homology Modeling Pipeline" by Rowan Hatherley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets or databases that are utilized in the study. The abstract mentions the development of an interactive modeling pipeline but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets or databases that are relevant to the homology modeling process. The introduction discusses the importance of computational methods and references existing databases but does not specify any datasets used in the experiments.

I will then look into the **methods section**, particularly focusing on any subsections that describe the modeling process or data input requirements. The paper mentions the use of MODELLER for modeling, which requires template structures, but it does not provide specific datasets.

In the **supplementary information**, I will check for any additional details regarding datasets or databases that may not have been included in the main text. The supplementary material discusses the Job Management System (JMS) and various alignment options but does not mention specific datasets either.

Since the paper does not explicitly list any datasets, I will look for references to external databases or resources that might be implied. The references to tools like HHPred and the PDB (Protein Data Bank) suggest that these resources are integral to the modeling process.

Now, I will compile the relevant citations for the tools and databases mentioned in the paper:

1. **MODELLER**: 
   > Sali, A. and Blundell, T.L. (1993) Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints. *J. Mol. Biol.*, 234, 779–815.

2. **HHPred**: 
   > Söding, J. et al. (2005) The HHpred interactive server for protein homology detection and structure prediction. *Nucleic Acids Res.*, 33, W244–W248.

3. **PDB (Protein Data Bank)**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the PDB, it is a well-known resource in the field. A common citation is:
   > Berman, H.M. et al. (2000) The Protein Data Bank. *Nucleic Acids Res.*, 28, 235–242.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather references tools and databases, I will note that the datasets used for modeling are derived from these resources.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have documented the relevant citations for the tools and databases mentioned in the paper, as they are crucial for understanding the context of the research.
