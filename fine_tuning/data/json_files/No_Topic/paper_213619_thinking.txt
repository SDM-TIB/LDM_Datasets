To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Multi-Information Source Bayesian Quadrature" by Javier Gonzalez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on an epidemiological model, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this model.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors describe two main experiments: one involving a synthetic multi-source setting and another involving an epidemiological model. I will look for specific datasets mentioned in these experiments.

In the **synthetic multi-source setting**, the authors mention using two sources, but they do not provide specific dataset names. Instead, they describe the functions used for the experiments. Therefore, I will note that while there are no formal datasets cited, the functions themselves are critical to the experiment.

In the **epidemiological model** (Section 4.2), the authors refer to the SIR model and its extensions, which are based on stochastic simulations. They mention that querying the primary source requires numerous realizations of a stochastic four-compartment epidemic model. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this model either.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with formal citations, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the cited works. The references include foundational papers on the SIR model and Bayesian quadrature, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that while the authors discuss methodologies and models extensively, they do not provide formal datasets with citations. Therefore, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Multi-Source Setting**: No specific dataset is mentioned; the functions used are critical for the experiment.
2. **Epidemiological Model**: The SIR model is referenced, but no specific dataset is provided.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will note that the paper primarily focuses on methodologies rather than specific datasets. 

In summary, I will document my findings, emphasizing the lack of explicit datasets while acknowledging the importance of the models and functions discussed in the experiments.
