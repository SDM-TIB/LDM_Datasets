To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Planning Not to Talk: Multiagent Systems that are Robust to Communication Loss" by Cyrus Neary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used or referenced. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

2. **Identify Relevant Sections**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss experiments or evaluations, as they often detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the identified sections, I will look for specific descriptions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will note down any quantitative details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific features that are highlighted.

4. **Check the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Document the Findings**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the information into a structured format. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation process.
