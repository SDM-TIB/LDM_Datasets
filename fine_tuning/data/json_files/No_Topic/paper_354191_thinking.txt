To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-readily identifiable data collaboration analysis for multiple datasets including personal information" by Akira Imakura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of multiple medical datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and mention conducting numerical experiments on medical datasets. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, specifically mentioning five datasets obtained from the survival package of the R language. These datasets are:

1. **Colon Dataset**: Contains data for chemotherapy for Stage B/C colon cancer with 888 samples and 13 features.
2. **Kidney Dataset**: Contains data related to kidney catheterization with 76 samples and 6 features.
3. **Lung Dataset**: Contains data from the NCCTG Lung Catheter Data with 167 samples and 7 features.
4. **PBC Dataset**: Contains data from the Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cholangitis study with 276 samples and 17 features.
5. **Veteran Dataset**: Contains data from the Veteransâ€™ Administration Lung Cancer Study with 137 samples and 4 features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from a specific package (the survival package of the R language), they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the source as the survival package documentation.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details, ensuring to include the source of the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
