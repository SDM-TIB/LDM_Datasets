To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Neurosymbolic Generative Models via Program Synthesis" by Halley Young et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on both synthetic and real-world data, which indicates that there are datasets involved. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges faced by generative models and hints at the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is based on MNIST and consists of a 9 × 9 grid where each cell is filled with either a colored MNIST digit or a solid color background. The authors specify that it contains 10,000 training images and 500 test images.

2. **Facades Dataset**: This dataset comprises 1,855 images of building facades, with 1,755 used for training and 100 for testing. The images are scaled to a size of 256 × 256 pixels and divided into a grid of 15 × 15 cells.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used, so I will note that the synthetic dataset is derived from MNIST, which is a well-known dataset, and the facades dataset is likely based on existing datasets used in computer vision research.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

For the **Facades dataset**, the citation is:
> Tyleˇcek, R. and ˇSára, R. *Spatial Pattern Templates for Recognition of Objects with Regular Structure*. In Proc. GCPR, Saarbrucken, Germany, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
