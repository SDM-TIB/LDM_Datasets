To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KinePose: A temporally optimized inverse kinematics technique for 6DOF human pose estimation with biomechanical constraints" by Kevin Gildea et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a technique for 3D human pose estimation, which suggests that datasets may be involved, especially in the context of evaluating the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction discusses the limitations of current motion capture technologies and references various pose estimation methods, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed KinePose technique. The authors may describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors report any performance metrics based on specific datasets. This could provide additional context about the datasets used and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions datasets like **Human3.6M** or any other specific datasets, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations. For example, if the authors reference the Human3.6M dataset, I would look for the citation:

> Ionescu, C., Papava, D., Olaru, V., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6M: Large Scale Datasets and Predictive Methods for 3D Human Sensing in Natural Environments. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 36(7), 1325-1339.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their characteristics.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information for structured output.
