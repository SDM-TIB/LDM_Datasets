To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Prompt Cell: A Portable Control Module for Effective Prompt Tuning" by Chi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results demonstrate a 5.8% improvement on **SuperGLUE datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that they evaluate their method on the **SuperGLUE benchmark**, which consists of several datasets. The specific datasets listed in this section are:

1. **BoolQ**: A dataset for question answering.
2. **CB (CommitmentBank)**: A dataset for natural language inference.
3. **COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives)**: Another natural language inference dataset.
4. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for natural language inference.
5. **WiC (Word-in-Context)**: A dataset for word sense disambiguation.
6. **WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge)**: A dataset for co-reference resolution.

The paper provides statistics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the SuperGLUE benchmark and its constituent datasets. The SuperGLUE benchmark is cited as follows:

- For **SuperGLUE**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Pruksachatkun, Y., Nangia, N., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., Bowman, S. *SuperGLUE: A Stickier Benchmark for General-Purpose Language Understanding Systems*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 32, Curran Associates, Inc., 2019.

The individual datasets may not have separate citations in the references, as they are part of the SuperGLUE benchmark. However, I will note that the SuperGLUE benchmark encompasses these datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the SuperGLUE benchmark, which serves as the authoritative source for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
