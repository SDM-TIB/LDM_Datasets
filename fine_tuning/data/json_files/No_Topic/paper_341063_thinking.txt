To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Noisy Label Correction for Fine-Grained Entity Typing" by Weiran Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two popular benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two standard fine-grained entity typing datasets:

1. **Ultra-Fine Dataset**: This dataset contains 6,000 manually annotated samples and 2519 categories. The authors mention that they use a specific train/dev/test split of 2k/2k/2k.

2. **OntoNotes Dataset**: The original OntoNotes dataset consists of 25,000 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 9,000 test samples, with 89 categories. The authors also note that there is an augmented version of this dataset containing 800,000 samples.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Ultra-Fine Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Eunsol Choi, Omer Levy, Yejin Choi, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Ultra-fine entity typing*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 87â€“96, 2018.

- For the **OntoNotes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Heng Ji, and Ralph Grishman. *The OntoNotes Release 5.0*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
