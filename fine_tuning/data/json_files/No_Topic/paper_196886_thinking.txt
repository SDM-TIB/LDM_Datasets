To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear combination of one-step predictive information with an external reward in an episodic policy gradient setting: a critical analysis" by Keyan Zahedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will focus on the sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in embodied artificial intelligence and mention the use of intrinsic motivation for task-dependent learning. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**. This section often contains information about the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. The authors describe three different experiments, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings from the experiments. They describe the cart-pole swing-up task, hexapod locomotion, and hexapod self-rescue experiments. I will look for any references to datasets used in these experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the experimental setups and the parameters used for their simulations. The experiments are conducted using simulated environments rather than real-world datasets.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. However, I will note that the experiments utilize simulated environments and parameters derived from previous works, which may be relevant for future research but do not constitute formal datasets.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses various experiments and methodologies, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile into a structured output.
