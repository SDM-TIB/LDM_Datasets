To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistent Selection of Tuning Parameters via Variable Selection Stability" by Wei Sun, Junhui Wang, and Yixin Fang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Data Analysis."** These sections often contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to real-world data applications, as the authors mention an application to **prostate cancer data**. This suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this application.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors indeed reference the **prostate cancer dataset** used in their analysis. They describe it as consisting of 97 patients with various clinical measures, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the prostate cancer dataset. The paper cites the original study that introduced this dataset:

- For the **prostate cancer dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stamey, T.A., Kabalin, J.N., McNeal, J.E., Johnstone, I.M., Freiha, F., Redwine, E.A., & Yang, N. (1989). Prostate specific antigen in the diagnosis and treatment of adenocarcinoma of the prostate: II. Radical prostatectomy treated patients. *Journal of Urology*, 141, 1076-1083.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and cited.
