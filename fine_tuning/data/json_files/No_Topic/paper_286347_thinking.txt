To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Program Synthesis Guided Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Environments" by Yichen David Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any sections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Benchmarks." 

In this paper, the authors describe two environments used for their experiments: the **2D Minecraft-inspired environment** and the **box-world environment**. I will note these environments as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to find any citations related to the datasets or environments mentioned. This is important for providing full citations for any datasets or benchmarks referenced in the paper.

For the **2D Minecraft-inspired environment**, I will look for any specific references to datasets or prior work that may have introduced this environment. If the authors cite a specific paper or dataset, I will ensure to include that citation.

For the **box-world environment**, I will similarly check for any references or citations that provide more context or details about this environment.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset or environment mentioned in the paper. This will involve formatting the citations according to the standards used in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its respective citation, ready for further processing or review.
