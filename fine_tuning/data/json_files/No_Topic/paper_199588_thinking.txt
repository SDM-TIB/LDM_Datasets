To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pontogammarus Maeoticus Swarm Optimization: A Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm" by Benyamin Ghojogh and Saeed Sharifian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the algorithm and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm. In this case, the authors refer to the **CEC05 benchmarks** for evaluating their optimization algorithm. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to gather more details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the CEC05 benchmarks, which include various types of benchmark functions for optimization. They mention that these benchmarks are standard for metaheuristic optimization and provide a link to where these datasets can be accessed. 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CEC05 benchmarks. The authors reference the following:

- For the CEC 2005 benchmarks, the citation is:
  > P. N. Suganthan, N. Hansen, J. J. Liang, K. Deb, Y.-P. Chen, A. Auger, and S. Tiwari. *Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the cec 2005 special session on real-parameter optimization*. KanGAL report, vol. 2005005, pp. 1â€“50, 2005.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for further processing or review.
