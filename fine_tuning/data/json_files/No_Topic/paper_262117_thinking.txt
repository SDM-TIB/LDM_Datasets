To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Risk Minimization in the Non-interactive Local Model of Differential Privacy" by Di Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that have been used in previous studies, as this can provide context for the datasets they chose to use.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

If the authors mention any other datasets, such as **CIFAR-10**, I would find its citation as well:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 Dataset*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information into a structured format for easy reference and future use.
