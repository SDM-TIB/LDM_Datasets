To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speech Emotion Recognition under Resource Constraints with Data Distillation" by Yi Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "synthesised, smaller, and distilled dataset," which indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find its specific name and details.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **Database of Elicited Mood in Speech (DEMoS)**, providing details about its composition, including the number of audio recordings and the emotional states represented. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's structure and the specific emotional categories included.

The authors state that the DEMoS dataset consists of 7.7 hours of audio recordings from 68 participants, with a total of 9,365 audio samples categorized into seven emotional states. They also mention the distribution of these samples across training, validation, and test sets, which is important for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the DEMoS dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> E. Parada-Cabaleiro, G. Costantini, A. Batliner, M. Schmitt, and B. Schuller. *DEMoS: An Italian emotional speech corpus*. Language Resources and Evaluation, pp. 1–43, Feb. 2019.

Now that I have the dataset name and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Database of Elicited Mood in Speech (DEMoS)
   - **Description**: An Italian speech corpus consisting of 7.7 hours of audio recordings from 68 participants, including 9,365 audio samples categorized into seven emotional states (anger, disgust, fear, guilt, happiness, sadness, and surprise).
   - **Citation**: E. Parada-Cabaleiro, G. Costantini, A. Batliner, M. Schmitt, and B. Schuller. *DEMoS: An Italian emotional speech corpus*. Language Resources and Evaluation, pp. 1–43, Feb. 2019.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset's details and citation are accurately represented.
