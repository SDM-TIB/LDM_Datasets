To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State-Compensation-Linearization-Based Stability Margin Analysis for a Class of Nonlinear Systems: A Data-Driven Method" by Jinrui Ren and Quan Quan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention if any datasets were used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section IV (State-Compensation-Linearization-Based Stability Margin Analysis)** and **section V (Simulation Studies)**. These sections often detail the experiments conducted and the datasets used.

In section V, the authors describe three numerical examples to illustrate the effectiveness of their proposed method. I will carefully analyze these examples to see if they reference any datasets or provide details about the data used in their simulations.

While reviewing the examples, I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned, such as the parameters or configurations used in the simulations. If the authors refer to any existing datasets or provide details about the data generation process, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation. If they describe a dataset they created, I will summarize its characteristics and provide a citation for the paper itself.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for each one. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings.
