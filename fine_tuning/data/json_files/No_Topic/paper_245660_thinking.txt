To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAT Heritage: a community-driven effort for archiving, building and running more than thousand SAT solvers" by Gilles Audemard et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for archiving SAT solvers but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (History of SAT solvers releases and publications)**, where the authors discuss various SAT competitions and the number of solvers involved. This section may provide insights into datasets used in these competitions, but I need to look for specific names or references to datasets.

In **section 3 (SAT Heritage Docker images)**, the authors describe their tool for archiving SAT solvers and mention that the tool relies on Docker images for execution. However, they do not explicitly list datasets here either. I will need to check if they reference any datasets in the context of the competitions mentioned earlier.

I will also look at the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. The authors mention several competitions and initiatives, but I need to determine if any of these have associated datasets that can be cited.

After reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the SAT competitions and the solvers involved, but they do not provide specific datasets or their citations. However, I can infer that the datasets used in these competitions are likely the benchmarks provided by the competition organizers.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will look up the following references mentioned in the paper:

1. **SAT2002 competition report**:
   > Laurent Simon, Daniel Le Berre, and Edward A. Hirsch. *The SAT2002 competition report*. Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, 43(1):207–342, 2005.

2. **Satex framework**:
   > Laurent Simon and Philippe Chatalic. *Satex: A web-based framework for SAT experimentation*. Electron. Notes Discret. Math., 9:129–149, 2001.

3. **Software Heritage**:
   > Roberto Di Cosmo and Stefano Zacchiroli. *Software Heritage: Why and how to preserve software source code*. In International Conference on Digital Preservation, pages 1–10, 2017.

While the paper does not explicitly list datasets, the references to competitions and frameworks imply that datasets are associated with these events. I will compile the relevant citations for the competitions and frameworks mentioned, as they are crucial for understanding the datasets used in SAT solver research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for any datasets I can identify, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset or competition referenced in the paper.
