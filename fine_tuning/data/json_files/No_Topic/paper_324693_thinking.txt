To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Objective hearing threshold identification from auditory brainstem response measurements using supervised and self-supervised approaches" by Dominik Thalmeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used large-scale mouse phenotyping programs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference two significant datasets: the **GMC dataset** and the **ING dataset**. They mention that the GMC dataset consists of averaged ABR raw data from the German Mouse Clinic, while the ING dataset is an external dataset from the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Next, I will look into the **materials and methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Data generation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **GMC Dataset**: This dataset includes data from 2,654 mutant mice and 1,707 control mice, with a total of 4,361 mice. It contains information on various single-gene knockout mouse lines and their auditory brainstem response measurements.

2. **ING Dataset**: This dataset comprises data from over 9,000 mice, including 1,211 single-gene mutant lines and respective control mice. The authors thank the original authors for making this dataset publicly available.

In the **results section**, the authors summarize the properties of both datasets in **Table 1**, which provides additional context about the number of mice, gene cohort sizes, and the number of distinct knockout genes.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GMC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gailus-Durner, Valerie et al. (2005). "Introducing the German Mouse Clinic: Open access platform for standardized phenotyping." *Nature methods*, 2, 403-404. doi: 10.1038/nmeth0605-403.

- For the **ING dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ingham, Neil J., Selina A. Pearson, Valerie E. Vancollie, et al. (2019b). Data from: Mouse screen reveals multiple new genes underlying mouse and human hearing loss. doi: 10.5061/DRYAD.CV803RV.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
