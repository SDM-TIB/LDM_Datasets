To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Elliptical Ordinal Embedding" by Aïssatou Diallo and Johannes Fürnkranz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the ordinal embedding problem and its applications but does not specify any datasets yet.

I will then move to **section 5 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Food Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the method on relative similarity comparisons of food images. The authors cite the work of Wilber et al. (2014) for this dataset.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe their experiments on the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits used for various machine learning tasks.

Now, I will look in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Food Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael J. Wilber, Iljung S. Kwak, and Serge J. Belongie. *Cost-effective hits for relative similarity comparisons*. In Proceedings of the 2nd AAAI conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP), 2014.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, the MNIST dataset is widely recognized and can be cited as:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
