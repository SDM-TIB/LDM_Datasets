To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smart App Attack: Hacking Deep Learning Models in Android Apps" by Yujin Huang and Chunyang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions evaluating the attack effectiveness in terms of "four different settings including pre-trained models, datasets, transfer learning approaches and adversarial attack algorithms." This indicates that datasets are indeed a focus of the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for object recognition tasks and contains 50,000 images across 10 classes, with a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **GTSRB Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for traffic sign recognition and consists of 39,209 images of 43 different traffic signs, along with a test dataset of 12,630 images.

3. **Oxford Flowers Dataset**: This dataset is employed for flower recognition tasks and contains 6,149 images from 102 classes, with a test dataset of 1,020 images.

The authors provide detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their purposes and the number of images they contain, which confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **GTSRB Dataset**:
  > J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. "The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition." In IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2011, pp. 1453â€“1460.

- For **Oxford Flowers Dataset**:
  > M.-E. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. "Automated flower classification over a large number of classes." In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing, Dec 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
