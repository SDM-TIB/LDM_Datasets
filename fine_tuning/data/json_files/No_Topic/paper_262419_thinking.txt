To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IoT Wallet: Machine Learning-based Sensor Portfolio Application" by Petar Šolić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions a case study involving soil moisture prediction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to soil moisture and sensor data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe data collection and the machine learning processes. In this section, the authors discuss collecting soil moisture data along with signal strength measurements (RSSI and SNR) from LoRa-based sensor devices. They also mention using publicly available data from the State Hydrometeorological Institute, which indicates that this data is part of the dataset used for their analysis.

I will then look for specific details about the datasets in the **case study section**. The authors state that they collected data every 10 minutes from mid-February 2020 to mid-August 2020, totaling 23,592 data points. This data includes features such as RSSI, SNR, air temperature, air humidity, and air pressure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the State Hydrometeorological Institute for the publicly available data, but it does not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is publicly available but lacks a formal citation in the paper.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Soil Moisture Data**: Collected from a LoRa-based sensor device, which includes measurements of soil moisture, RSSI, and SNR.
2. **Publicly Available Data from the State Hydrometeorological Institute**: This includes air temperature, air humidity, and air pressure data.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the State Hydrometeorological Institute data, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset but will not be able to provide a full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the details I have gathered, and prepare them for structured output. The focus will be on clearly documenting the datasets and their sources, even if one of them lacks a formal citation.
