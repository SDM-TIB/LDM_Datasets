To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble Adversarial Defense via Integration of Multiple Dispersed Low Curvature Models" by Kaikang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted across various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny-ImageNet** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly stated.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. 2017. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
