To extract datasets from the research paper titled "scBiGNN: Bilevel Graph Representation Learning for Cell Type Classification from Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data" by Rui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets for cell type classification, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list five benchmark datasets used for their experiments in **section 4.1 (Benchmark Datasets)**. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Zheng68K**: This dataset is described as containing 65,943 cells and 20,387 genes, derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using the 10X Chromium protocol.

2. **Zhengsorted**: This dataset consists of 20,000 cells and 21,952 genes, also from human PBMCs, processed with the 10X Chromium protocol.

3. **BaronHuman**: This dataset includes 12,832 cells and 42,625 genes, sourced from human pancreas tissue using the inDrop protocol.

4. **BaronMouse**: This dataset contains 1,886 cells and 17,499 genes, derived from mouse pancreas tissue, also using the inDrop protocol.

5. **AMB**: This dataset consists of 14 cell types, with 14,861 genes and 10,000 cells, from mouse primary visual cortex tissue, processed with the SMART-Seq v4 protocol.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer that they are commonly used datasets in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing. Therefore, I will provide the citations based on the original sources of these datasets:

- For **Zheng68K** and **Zhengsorted**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, G. X. Y., Terry, J. M., Belgrader, P., et al. (2017). *Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells*. Nature Communications, 8, 14049.

- For **BaronHuman** and **BaronMouse**, the citation is:
  > Baron, M., Veres, A., Wolock, S. L., et al. (2016). *A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure*. Cell Systems, 3(4), 346-360.

- For **AMB**, the citation is:
  > Wang, L., et al. (2020). *An interpretable deep-learning architecture of capsule networks for identifying cell-type gene expression programs from single-cell RNA-sequencing data*. Nature Machine Intelligence, 2(11), 693-703.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
