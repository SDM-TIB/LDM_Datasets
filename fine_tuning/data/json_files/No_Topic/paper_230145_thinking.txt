To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature discriminativity estimation in CNNs for transfer learning" by Victor Gimenez-Abalos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the introduction and methods for detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training CNNs and the importance of transfer learning, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will proceed to the **methods section**, where they describe their approach and any datasets used for experiments.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors list several datasets they used for their target tasks. They mention the following datasets:

1. **MIT Indoor Scene Recognition dataset (mit67)**: This dataset is used for recognizing indoor scenes and contains images from 67 categories.

2. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset (cub200)**: This dataset is focused on bird species classification and includes images of 200 bird categories.

3. **Oxford Flower dataset (flowers102)**: This dataset consists of images of flowers from 102 different categories.

4. **Oxford-IIIT-Pet dataset (cats-dogs)**: This dataset includes images of cats and dogs, used for pet classification tasks.

5. **Stanford Dogs dataset (stanforddogs)**: This dataset contains images of various dog breeds for classification.

6. **Caltech 101 dataset (caltech101)**: This dataset includes images from 101 object categories.

7. **Caltech 256 dataset (caltech256)**: An extension of Caltech 101, this dataset contains images from 256 object categories.

8. **Food-101 dataset (food101)**: This dataset consists of images of food items across 101 categories.

9. **Describable Textures Dataset (textures)**: This dataset includes images of various textures for classification.

10. **Oulu Knots dataset (wood)**: This dataset is used for recognizing different types of wood knots.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
