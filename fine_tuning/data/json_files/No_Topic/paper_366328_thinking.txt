To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Fleet-wide Sharing of Wind Turbine Condition Information through Privacy-preserving Federated Learning" by L. Jenkela et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the collection of terabytes of data from wind turbines, indicating that datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **case studies** section, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention two case studies involving **normal behavior models (NBMs)** for wind turbines, specifically focusing on **bearing temperatures** and **active power generation**. 

In the **first case study**, the authors describe the use of SCADA data from **ten commercial onshore wind turbines**. They specify that each turbine has around **50,000 valid data points** collected over **13 months**. This dataset includes measurements such as wind speeds, power generation, and gear bearing temperatures.

In the **second case study**, they again utilize SCADA data from the same ten turbines, emphasizing the same types of measurements. The authors also mention that the data from these turbines are not shared among them, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or unpublished data from the wind turbine manufacturers. Instead, I will note the general source of the data as SCADA systems from the wind turbines.

To summarize, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **SCADA Data from Ten Commercial Onshore Wind Turbines**: This dataset includes measurements of wind speeds, power generation, and gear bearing temperatures, collected over a period of 13 months, with each turbine holding around 50,000 valid data points.

Since there are no specific citations for the datasets, I will note that they are derived from the SCADA systems of the wind turbines, as mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
