To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Machine Learning Analysis for Software Quality Test" by Al Khan, Remudin Reshid Mekuria, and Ruslan Isaev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which may hint at the types of data used. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the data collection process. In this paper, they mention that the complete data collection was composed of information collected over ten years, but only the most recent four years of data were used due to a change in the release strategy. This indicates that there is a dataset related to software features and defect reports.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss various tests and the data used for those tests. They mention that the dataset used was made up of four subsets: **Trouble reports, Software feature data, Commit data, and Miscellaneous information**. Each of these subsets likely represents a distinct dataset that contributes to the overall analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or internal to the organization. Instead, I will note the descriptions of the datasets as they are presented in the text.

The datasets identified are:

1. **Trouble Reports Dataset**: Contains information on defect reports, including dates, versions, and severity of failures.
2. **Software Feature Data Dataset**: Includes high-level details about software features, such as completion dates and development periods.
3. **Commit Data Dataset**: Describes each commit made to the main branch, including lines of code added, removed, or changed.
4. **Miscellaneous Information Dataset**: Supplemental data that connects other datasets, such as release date lists.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will summarize their descriptions instead.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the relevant details about each dataset as described in the paper.
