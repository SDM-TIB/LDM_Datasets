To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Detection of Cyberbullying in Social Media Text" by Cynthia Van Hee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected and annotated a training corpus for English and Dutch, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Data Collection and Annotation)**, where the authors describe the construction of two corpora: one for English and one for Dutch. This section provides specific details about the datasets, including the source of the data and the number of posts collected.

1. **English ASKfm Corpus**: The authors mention that this corpus consists of 113,698 posts collected from the social networking site ASKfm. The posts were manually annotated for cyberbullying according to a fine-grained annotation scheme.

2. **Dutch ASKfm Corpus**: Similarly, the Dutch corpus contains 78,387 posts, also collected from ASKfm and annotated using the same scheme.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their classifiers on these datasets, confirming their significance in the experiments conducted.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are original contributions of the authors and not previously published datasets, I will cite them as follows:

- For the **English ASKfm Corpus**:
  > Van Hee, C., Lefever, E., Verhoeven, B., Mennes, J., Desmet, B., De Pauw, G., & Hoste, V. (2015). *Automatic detection and prevention of cyberbullying*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Human and Social Analytics (pp. 13–18). IARIA.

- For the **Dutch ASKfm Corpus**:
  > Van Hee, C., Lefever, E., Verhoeven, B., Mennes, J., Desmet, B., De Pauw, G., & Hoste, V. (2015). *Detection and fine-grained classification of cyberbullying events*. In Proceedings of Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (pp. 672–680).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further use.
