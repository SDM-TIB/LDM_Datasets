To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fibration symmetry uncovers minimal regulatory networks for logical computation in bacteria" by Luis A. Álvarez-García et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their research. This section often contains background information and may reference previous studies or datasets that are relevant to the current work.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the data collection process, including any specific datasets that were analyzed, their sources, and any preprocessing steps taken.

The **results section** may also provide insights into the datasets, especially if the authors present findings based on specific data analyses. I will take note of any datasets mentioned in relation to the results obtained.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets used, including their significance, limitations, or comparisons to other datasets. This section may also provide additional context or references to datasets that were not mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention the **RegulonDB** dataset, I will look for the complete citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Salgado, H., et al. "RegulonDB 11.0: Comprehensive high-throughput datasets on transcriptional regulation in Escherichia coli K-12." *Microbial Genomics*, 8(5): 000833, 2022.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details as presented in the paper. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
