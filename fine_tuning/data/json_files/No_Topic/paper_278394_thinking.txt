To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fault diagnosis for linear heterodirectional hyperbolic ODE-PDE systems using backstepping-based trajectory planning" by Ferdinand Fischer and Joachim Deutscher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section exists, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results or experiments section** where the authors might discuss the datasets used for validation or testing of their proposed methods. I will pay attention to any references to datasets, including their names and any specific details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "Example Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly available, I may need to search for it in other literature or online databases.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per the requirements.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, making sure to clearly present the names, descriptions, and citations of each dataset extracted from the paper.
