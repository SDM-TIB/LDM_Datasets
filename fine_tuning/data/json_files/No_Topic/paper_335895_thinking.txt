To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CICERO: A Dataset for Contextualized Commonsense Inference in Dialogues" by Deepanway Ghosal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of the **CICERO dataset**, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset discussed in the paper. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, specifying that it contains inferences from dyadic conversations.

Next, I will look for any **sections specifically dedicated to datasets**. In this paper, the relevant section is **section 2 (Construction of CICERO)**, where the authors describe how the CICERO dataset was constructed, including the types of inferences it contains and the number of dialogues. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's characteristics.

In addition to the CICERO dataset, the authors mention three source datasets used to build CICERO: 

1. **DailyDialog**: This dataset covers dialogues from a wide range of topics and is referenced in the construction of CICERO.
2. **MuTual**: A multi-turn dialogue reasoning dataset that is also used as a source for CICERO.
3. **DREAM**: A reading-comprehension dataset that contributes to the dialogues in CICERO.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DailyDialog**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP 2017), pages 986–995.

- For **MuTual**, the citation is:

- For **DREAM**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
