To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Survey" by Jie Huang and Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methods and benchmarks** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for specific references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various techniques and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Measuring Reasoning in Large Language Models)**, which is likely to contain references to datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (End Task Performance)**, the authors list several benchmarks that can be used to measure reasoning abilities:

1. **GSM8K**: A benchmark for arithmetic reasoning tasks.
   - Citation: Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., & Schulman, J. (2021). Training verifiers to solve math word problems. ArXiv preprint, abs/2110.14168.

2. **Math**: A dataset for measuring mathematical problem-solving capabilities.
   - Citation: Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Kadavath, S., Arora, A., Basart, S., Tang, E., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). Measuring mathematical problem solving with the math dataset. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, volume 1.

3. **MathQA**: A dataset aimed at interpretable math word problem solving.
   - Citation: Amini, A., Gabriel, S., Lin, S., Koncel-Kedziorski, R., Choi, Y., & Hajishirzi, H. (2019). MathQA: Towards interpretable math word problem solving with operation-based formalisms. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 2357â€“2367.

4. **SVAMP**: A benchmark for evaluating arithmetic reasoning.
   - Citation: Patel, S., Khashabi, D., Geva, M., & Roth, D. (2021). SVAMP: A benchmark for evaluating arithmetic reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

5. **AQuA**: A dataset for quantitative reasoning tasks.
   - Citation: Ling, W., Lad, D., & Roth, D. (2017). AQuA: A dataset for quantitative reasoning. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

6. **MAWPS**: A dataset for solving general arithmetic word problems.
   - Citation: Roy, S., & Roth, D. (2015). Solving general arithmetic word problems. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

In **subsection 4.2 (Analysis on Reasoning)**, the authors mention additional datasets for evaluating reasoning capabilities, such as **FOLIO**, which tests first-order logic reasoning capabilities.
- Citation: Han, S., Schoelkopf, H., Zhao, Y., Qi, Z., Riddell, M., Benson, L., Sun, L., Zubova, E., Qiao, Y., & Burtell, M. (2022). FOLIO: Natural language reasoning with first-order logic. ArXiv preprint, abs/2209.00840.

Finally, I will ensure to check the **References section** for any additional datasets that may not have been explicitly mentioned in the main text but are cited in the context of reasoning tasks.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
