To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Use HiResCAM instead of Grad-CAM for faithful explanations of convolutional neural networks" by Rachel Lea Draelos and Lawrence Carin, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors typically describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments, including any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of annotations, and the context in which the datasets were used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset consists of 2D RGB natural images with ground truth segmentation maps for 20 classes. The authors state that they augmented the training set with an additional dataset, SBD, resulting in a total of 7,087 images for training and 1,449 images for validation.

2. **RAD-ChestCT**: This dataset includes 36,316 chest computed tomography scans annotated with 83 different abnormalities. The authors use this dataset to provide qualitative comparisons of their proposed method.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303â€“338, 2010.

- For **RAD-ChestCT**, the citation is:
  > Rachel Lea Draelos, David Dov, Maciej A. Mazurowski, Joseph Y. Lo, Ricardo Henao, Geoffrey D. Rubin, and Lawrence Carin. *Machine-learning-based multiple abnormality prediction with large-scale chest computed tomography volumes*. Medical Image Analysis, 67, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
