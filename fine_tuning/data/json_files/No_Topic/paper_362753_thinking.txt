To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lower Bounds for the Convergence of Tensor Power Iteration on Random Overcomplete Models" by Yuchen Wu and Kangjie Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss tensor decomposition and its applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **numerical experiments section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In **section 4 (Numerical Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments and mention that they generated random tensors for their evaluations. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or benchmarks. Instead, they focus on the methodology and results of their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing tensor decomposition and related algorithms, rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or references to publicly available datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses the methodology and results of experiments involving tensor power iteration, it does not mention any specific datasets or provide citations for datasets. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to create for this paper.
