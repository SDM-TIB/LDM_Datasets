To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of Phasor Measurement Unit Requirements and Monitoring Architecture Practices for State Estimation at Distribution Systems" by Panayiotis Moutis and Omid Alizadeh-Mousavi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for monitoring distribution systems and the role of state estimation (SE). However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **Section II (Towards State Estimation at Distribution Systems)** and **Section III (Practical Concerns for State Estimation at Distribution Systems)**. These sections focus on the requirements and challenges of implementing SE in distribution systems but do not reference any specific datasets.

I will also check **Section IV (Conclusions and Future Work)**, which summarizes the findings and suggests future research directions. Again, there are no datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of literature discussing theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and case studies rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on theoretical discussions and the need for further research rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have retrieved their full citations from the references section to ensure proper attribution.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, no dataset entries will be created.
