To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weak Supervision and Referring Attention for Temporal-Textual Association Learning" by Zhiyuan Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a weakly supervised approach for learning temporal-textual associations, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for large-scale datasets with temporal-textual annotations. They reference two specific datasets: **DiDeMo** and **Charades-STA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments, the authors validate their method on the **DiDeMo** dataset and the **Charades-STA** dataset. They provide details about the DiDeMo dataset, stating it includes over 10,000 videos with temporal boundaries for fine localization, and the Charades-STA dataset, which contains video-query pairs with manual annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DiDeMo dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lisa Anne Hendricks, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Josef Sivic, Trevor Darrell, and Bryan Russell. *Localizing moments in video with natural language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5803–5812, 2017.

2. For the **Charades-STA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jiyang Gao, Chen Sun, Zhenheng Yang, and Ram Nevatia. *Tall: Temporal activity localization via language query*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5267–5275, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
