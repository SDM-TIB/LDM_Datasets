To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streaming Intended Query Detection using E2E Modeling for Continued Conversation" by Shuo-yiin Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two main types of data:

1. **Intended Voice Query Data**: This dataset consists of around 15 million utterances collected from Google’s voice search and actions on various mobile platforms and Google Home. This dataset is crucial for training the intended-query detector.

2. **Unintended Voice Transcription Data**: This dataset includes around 10 million utterances obtained from YouTube, which are used to train the model to differentiate between intended and unintended queries.

Additionally, the evaluation set is specified, which includes 53,000 utterances of proxy intended queries and 18,000 utterances of proxy unintended queries. These proxy queries are collected from 300 speakers and cover various scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from proprietary sources (Google's voice search and YouTube), they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the context in which they are used:

- **Intended Voice Query Data**: Collected from Google’s voice search and actions on various mobile platforms and Google Home. (No formal citation available)
  
- **Unintended Voice Transcription Data**: Collected from YouTube. (No formal citation available)

For the evaluation set, since it is derived from the aforementioned datasets, it does not have a separate citation either.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I highlight the context and usage of each dataset, even if formal citations are not available. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
