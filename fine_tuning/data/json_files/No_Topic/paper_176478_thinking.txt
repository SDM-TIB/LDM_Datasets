To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Traffic as Images: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Large-Scale Transportation Network Speed Prediction" by Xiaolei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and empirical study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two real-world transportation networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of predicting traffic evolution across an entire road network, hinting at the use of specific datasets for their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **empirical study section** where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the data were collected from **10,000 taxis equipped with GPS devices in Beijing**, which provides specific details about the dataset. The data includes vehicle positions, recording times, moving directions, and vehicle travel speeds, collected over a period from **May 1, 2015, to June 6, 2015**.

The authors specify that they used two sub-transportation networks for their experiments:
1. **Network 1**: The second ring road of Beijing, consisting of 236 road sections.
2. **Network 2**: A northeast transportation network in Beijing, consisting of 352 road sections.

These networks serve as the datasets for their experiments, and the authors aggregate the data into two-minute intervals for analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection efforts (i.e., GPS data from taxis), there may not be formal citations like those for established datasets. Instead, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: GPS data from taxis in Beijing (May 1, 2015 - June 6, 2015). This dataset includes vehicle positions, recording times, moving directions, and travel speeds.
- **Dataset 2**: Network 1 (Second ring road of Beijing) with 236 road sections.
- **Dataset 3**: Network 2 (Northeast transportation network of Beijing) with 352 road sections.

Since these datasets are not formally published in a separate paper, I will note that the citation for the dataset is the paper itself:

> Xiaolei Ma, Zhuang Dai, Zhengbing He, Jihui Ma, Yong Wang, and Yunpeng Wang. *Learning Traffic as Images: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Large-Scale Transportation Network Speed Prediction*. Sensors, 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations.
