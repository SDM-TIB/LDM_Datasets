To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Underwater object classification combining SAS and transferred optical-to-SAS Imagery" by Avi Abu and Roee Diamant, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors have developed a classification algorithm and collected a dataset of **7,052 pairs of SAS and optical images** during sea experiments. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors describe how they obtained their sonar dataset using a Kraken-made synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) mounted on an AUV. They mention that the dataset includes **86 SAS images and 82 optical images**, which are labeled as either cylinders, manta-mine, or natural objects. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's composition and the context in which it was collected.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional insights or clarifications about the dataset. The authors provide a breakdown of the dataset in Table 3, which lists the number of opportunities for each object type and the sensor type used for data collection.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. For the **SAS dataset**:
   > Abu, A., & Diamant, R. (2022). Underwater object classification combining SAS and transferred optical-to-SAS Imagery. *IEEE Sensors Journal*, 22(6), 6027–6041. doi:10.1109/JSEN.2022.3148530.

2. For the **optical dataset**:
   > Abu, A., & Diamant, R. (2022). Underwater object classification combining SAS and transferred optical-to-SAS Imagery. *IEEE Sensors Journal*, 22(6), 6027–6041. doi:10.1109/JSEN.2022.3148530.

Both datasets are part of the same study and are referenced in the same paper, so they share the same citation.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details such as the number of images, types of objects, and the context of data collection. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
