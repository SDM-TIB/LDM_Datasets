To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sim-to-Real Dense Object Descriptors for Robotic Manipulation" by Hoang-Giang Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of public datasets, specifically **GraspNet**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** or **Data Collection** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors discuss the **GraspNet** dataset in detail in the **Data Collection and Training SRDONs** subsection. Here, they provide specific information about the dataset, including the number of images, objects, and scenes.

The authors state that they primarily use the **GraspNet** dataset, which consists of 97,280 RGBD images of 88 objects across 190 cluttered scenes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note down its details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **GraspNet** dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Hao-Shu Fang, Chenxi Wang, Minghao Gou, and Cewu Lu. *GraspNet-1billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11444â€“11453, 2020.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **GraspNet** dataset as required. This will ensure that the extracted information is complete and ready for further use.
