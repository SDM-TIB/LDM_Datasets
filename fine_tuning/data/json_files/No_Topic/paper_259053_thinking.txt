To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMART GRID: A SURVEY OF ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS, MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS" by Navod Neranjan Thilakarathne et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing machine learning and deep learning applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the smart grid and its reliance on data analytics, but it does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that detail machine learning and deep learning applications**. In section 2, the authors discuss various applications of ML and DL in the context of the smart grid, including energy forecasting and security applications. I will look for tables or references to specific datasets used in these applications.

In **Table 1**, which summarizes ML and DL applications for energy forecasting, I will extract the relevant datasets mentioned alongside the techniques and applications. The references in this table will guide me to the original sources of the datasets.

Similarly, in **Table 2**, which outlines ML applications for securing the smart grid, I will identify any datasets referenced in the context of security applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly.

For example, if a dataset is referenced in Table 1, I will locate the corresponding reference in the bibliography to provide a complete citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy review or further processing.
