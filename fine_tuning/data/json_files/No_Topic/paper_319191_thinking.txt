To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Fairness via Federated Learning" by Yuchen Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that I should look for specific names.

2. **Identifying Sections**: Next, I will focus on sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Section 5 (Experiments)** and any dedicated **Datasets** section if available. These sections often provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments.

3. **Extracting Dataset Names**: In the **Experiments** section, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors might refer to datasets like "Adult," "COMPAS," or "Bank," which are commonly used in fairness studies. I will note down each dataset's name and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples or specific characteristics.

4. **Full Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References** section for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for each dataset. For example, if the paper mentions the "Adult" dataset, I will look for its citation, which might reference the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

5. **Documenting Details**: For each dataset, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - **Citation**: The full citation as found in the References section.

6. **Cross-Verification**: I will cross-check the extracted information with the text to ensure accuracy. If any dataset is mentioned in the context of experiments or results, I will confirm that it is included in my documentation.

7. **Final Compilation**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly labeled with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citations.
