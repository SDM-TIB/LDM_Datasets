To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Financial Products and their Supply Chains" by Margrét V. Bjarnadóttir and Louiqa Raschid, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, which includes the use of financial big data and machine learning methods. This suggests that there may be datasets related to financial products, particularly residential mortgage-backed securities (resMBS).

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically the **Data Extraction Protocol**. Here, the authors describe the dataset they constructed from approximately 5,000 prospectuses for resMBS issued between 2002 and 2007. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including its unique characteristics and the extraction process.

In the **Results and Discussion sections**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced, particularly those used for analysis or comparison. The authors mention using historical payment information from the Bloomberg repository, which is another dataset relevant to their research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **resMBS Dataset**: The dataset consists of approximately 5,000 prospectuses for residential mortgage-backed securities issued by private labels and filed with the SEC between 2002 and 2007. The authors note that this dataset is unique and not widely available.
   - Citation: Bjarnadóttir, M. V., & Raschid, L. (2023). *Modeling Financial Products and their Supply Chains*. University of Maryland.

2. **Bloomberg Repository**: This dataset provides performance history for each security identified in the prospectuses, including information on the structure of the security and tranche type, payment contingencies, and waterfall payoff details.
   - Citation: Bloomberg L.P. (2018). *Bloomberg Terminal*. Retrieved from https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting based on the findings of the paper.
