To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normalization of Non-Standard Words in Croatian Texts" by Slobodan Beliga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses text normalization methods but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of text normalization but again does not provide any dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **results section**, particularly where the authors discuss the performance of their normalization algorithms. They mention testing their methods on a corpus of selected Croatian texts, which includes 18 texts with a total of 11,034 words. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to gather more details.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a breakdown of the texts used for testing, categorized by genre (educational, scientific, popular, news, and formal). However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset or a specific citation. Instead, they describe the dataset in terms of its composition and the number of words and tokens.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that the dataset consists of 18 Croatian texts across various genres, but I will not be able to provide a full citation as it is not explicitly mentioned in the references.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Croatian Text Corpus**: This dataset consists of 18 texts from different genres (educational, scientific, popular, news, and formal) totaling 11,034 words. The dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed normalization algorithms.

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the paper, I will note that it is an internal dataset used for the study and does not have a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of a formal citation for the dataset while providing a detailed description of its contents.
