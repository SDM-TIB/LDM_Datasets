To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting University Students’ Academic Success and Major using Random Forests" by Cédric Beaulac and Jeffrey S. Rosenthal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "large data set containing every course taken by every undergraduate student in a major university in Canada over 10 years," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of predicting student success and the data provided by the University of Toronto. They specifically mention that the dataset contains "individual-level student grades for all undergraduate students enrolled at the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto - St. George campus between 2000 and 2010." This provides a clear identification of the dataset being used.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it contains "1,656,977 data points" and outlines the structure of the data points, including dimensions such as student ID, course title, department, semester, credit value, and numerical grade. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context for its use in the study.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any other datasets or provide further details about the dataset used. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one provided by the University of Toronto.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors acknowledge Glenn Loney and Sinisa Markovic of the University of Toronto for providing the data, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the information available:

- **University of Toronto Dataset**: 
  > University of Toronto. (2017). Individual-level student grades for all undergraduate students enrolled at the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto - St. George campus (2000-2010). 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any further analysis or application of the findings from this research paper.
