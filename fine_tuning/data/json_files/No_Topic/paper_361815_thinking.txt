To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Action Recognition Around the Clock" by Anwaar Ulhaq, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses two datasets: **InFAR** and **XD145**, which are used for action recognition tasks. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically where the datasets are described. In this case, the paper provides detailed information about both datasets:

1. **InFAR Dataset**: This dataset includes 600 video sequences captured by infrared thermal imaging cameras. It consists of various action classes, each containing 50 video clips with an average duration of 4 seconds. The frame rate is 25 fps, and the resolution is 293 by 256 pixels.

2. **XD145 Dataset**: This dataset is a visible light action dataset that mirrors the InFAR dataset. It also contains 600 video sequences, with 50 video clips for each action class, and each clip lasts about 5 seconds. The frame rate is 25 fps, and the resolution is 320 by 240 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **InFAR Dataset**:
  > Y. Xu, J. Yang, H. Cao, K. Mao, J. Yin, and S. See. *ARID: A new dataset for recognizing action in the dark*. In International Workshop on Deep Learning for Human Activity Recognition. Springer, 2021, pp. 70â€“84.

- For the **XD145 Dataset**:
  > Y. Liu, Z. Lu, J. Li, C. Yao, and Y. Deng. *Transferable feature representation for visible-to-infrared cross-dataset human action recognition*. Complexity, vol. 2018, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
