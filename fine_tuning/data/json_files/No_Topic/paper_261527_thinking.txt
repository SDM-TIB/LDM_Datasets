To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Advance in Content-based Image Retrieval: A Literature Survey" by Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, and Qi Tian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the sections that specifically discuss datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges and advancements in content-based image retrieval, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **datasets section** to find detailed information.

In **section 8 (Datasets and Performance Evaluation)**, the authors provide a comprehensive list of datasets used in their experiments. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **UKBench Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,200 images from 2,550 categories, with four images per category taken under different conditions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > "UKBench dataset." Available at: http://www.vis.uky.edu/∼stewe/ukbench/

2. **Holidays Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,491 images grouped into 500 categories, with images taken from various viewpoints. The citation is:
   > "Holidays dataset." Available at: http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/jegou/data.php

3. **Oxford Building Dataset (Oxford-5K)**: This dataset includes 5,062 images collected from Flickr, annotated for 11 different landmarks. The citation is:
   > "Oxford Building dataset." Available at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/oxbuildings/

4. **Paris Dataset**: This dataset contains 6,412 images collected from Flickr based on queries for Paris landmarks. The citation is:
   > "Paris dataset." Available at: http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/∼vgg/data/parisbuildings/

5. **DupImage Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,104 images from 33 groups, each representing a logo or artwork. The citation is:
   > "DupImage dataset." Available at: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jGETFUm

6. **FlickrLogos-32 Dataset**: This dataset contains logo images of 32 different brands, with a total of 8,240 images. The citation is:
   > "FlickrLogos-32 dataset." Available at: http://www.multimedia-computing.de/ﬂickrlogos/

7. **INSTRE Dataset**: This dataset consists of two subsets, with a total of 23,070 images in INSTRE-S and 5,473 images in INSTRE-M. The citation is:
   > "INSTRE dataset." Available at: http://vipl.ict.ac.cn/isia/instre/

8. **ZuBuD Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,005 images of buildings in Zurich, with additional query images. The citation is:
   > "ZuBuD dataset." Available at: http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/showroom/zubud/index.en.html

9. **Stanford Mobile Visual Search (SMVS) Dataset**: This dataset is targeted for mobile visual search and contains 1,200 distinct categories. The citation is:
   > "Stanford Mobile Visual Search dataset." Available at: http://purl.stanford.edu/rb470rw0983

10. **MIR Flickr-1M**: This is a distractor dataset with one million images from Flickr. The citation is:
    > "MIR Flickr-1M dataset." Available at: http://medialab.liacs.nl/mirﬂickr/mirﬂickr1m/

11. **Flickr1M**: Another distractor dataset containing SIFT features of one million images. The citation is:
    > "Flickr1M dataset." Available at: http://bigimbaz.inrialpes.fr/herve/siftgeo1M/

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their details and citations accurately for further processing or review.
