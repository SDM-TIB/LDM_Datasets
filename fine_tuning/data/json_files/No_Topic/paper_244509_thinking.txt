To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Open Relation Extraction from Scientific Texts" by Ruben Kruiper et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be introduced. The abstract mentions the **Focused Open Biological Information Extraction (FOBIE)** dataset, which is a clear indication that a dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will look into the **dataset description section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the FOBIE dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of sentences, the types of relations it includes, and how it was collected and annotated. The authors mention that FOBIE consists of 1,548 sentences from 1,292 unique documents, which is crucial information for my extraction.

Additionally, I will check the **related work section (Section 2)** to see if any other datasets are referenced. The authors mention several datasets, including **SCIENCEIE**, **SemEval 2018**, and **SCIERC**. I will gather information about these datasets as well, including their sizes and purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will need to extract include:

1. **FOBIE Dataset**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper, I will note that it is created by the authors themselves, and I will include the citation for the paper itself as the source.

2. **SCIENCEIE Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Isabelle Augenstein, Mrinal Das, Sebastian Riedel, Lakshmi Vikraman, and Andrew McCallum. *SemEval 2017 Task 10: ScienceIE - Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 546–555, 2017.

3. **SemEval 2018 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kata Gábor, Davide Buscaldi, Anne-Kathrin Schumann, Behrang Qasemizadeh, Hafa Zargayouna, and Thierry Charnois. *SemEval-2018 Task 7: Semantic Relation Extraction and Classification in Scientific Papers*. In SemEval, pages 679–688, 2018.

4. **SCIERC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yi Luan, Luheng He, Mari Ostendorf, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *Multi-Task Identification of Entities, Relations, and Coreference for Scientific Knowledge Graph Construction*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3219–3232, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its characteristics, and the corresponding citations.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each, which is crucial for academic integrity and further research.
