To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Linear Optimization with Adversarial Corruption" by Yingkai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give hints about the data used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to look for any specific datasets that the authors used to validate their algorithms. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this particular paper, I will look for any mentions of datasets related to stochastic linear optimization or adversarial corruption. If the authors refer to any established datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided in the text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, making sure to highlight each dataset's name, description, and citation for easy reference.
