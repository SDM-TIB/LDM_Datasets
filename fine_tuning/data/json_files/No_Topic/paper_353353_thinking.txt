To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Green Joint Communications and Sensing Employing Analog Multi-Beam Antenna Arrays" by Kai Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **methodology**, **experiments**, or **results**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss the implementation of the multi-beam antenna arrays and their applications in joint communications and sensing, as these may reference datasets used for validation or testing.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will ensure to capture their exact names and any associated metrics or characteristics.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and for others who may wish to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger study or comes from a well-known source, I will ensure to include that information in the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly. This structured approach will help in organizing the information clearly and effectively.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for any further processing or presentation.
