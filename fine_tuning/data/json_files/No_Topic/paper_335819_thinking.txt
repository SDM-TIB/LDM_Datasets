To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Incremental Learning for Action Recognition in Videos" by Jaeyoo Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "brand-new splits of class-incremental action recognition benchmarks constructed upon the UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-Something V2 datasets." This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of 13.3K videos from 101 action classes. The authors note that the organizers provide three splits for training and testing.

2. **HMDB51**: This dataset contains 6.8K examples from 51 action classes, also with three splits available for training and testing.

3. **Something-Something V2**: A large-scale motion-sensitive dataset with 169K training and 25K test videos across 174 action classes. This dataset is noted for requiring better temporal reasoning than the previous two.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > K. Soomro, A. Roshan Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. In CRCV-TR-12-01, 2012.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hilde Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In ICCV, 2011.

- For **Something-Something V2**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Freund, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The “Something Something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In ICCV, 2017.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
