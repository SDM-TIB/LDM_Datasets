To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Preserving Generalized Linear Models using Distributed Block Coordinate Descent" by Erik-Jan van Kesteren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulated and real-world examples, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their implementation and the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository:

1. **Forest Fire Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the area burned by forest fires based on weather observations. The authors reference the original source of this dataset.

2. **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting survival after diagnosis of liver cancer, and it is collected from Coimbra’s Hospital and University Centre in Portugal.

3. **Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset represents clinical diabetes care data over ten years and is used to predict hospital readmission.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation:

- For the **Forest Fire Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cortez, P., & Morais, A. D. J. R. (2007). A data mining approach to predict forest fires using meteorological data. In Proceedings of the 13th Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Associação Portuguesa para a Inteligência Artificial (APPIA), pp. 512–523.

- For the **HCC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Santos, M. S., Abreu, P. H., García-Laencina, P. J., Simão, A., & Carvalho, A. (2015). A new cluster-based oversampling method for improving survival prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 58, 49–59.

- For the **Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Strack, B., DeShazo, J. P., Gennings, C., Olmo, J. L., Ventura, S., Cios, K. J., & Clore, J. N. (2014). Impact of HbA1c measurement on hospital readmission rates: analysis of 70,000 clinical database patient records. BioMed Research International, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details and provide the necessary citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
