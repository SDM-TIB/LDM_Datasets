To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introduction to Presentation Attack Detection in Iris Biometrics and Recent Advances" by Aythami Morales et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses presentation attacks and detection methods but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the importance of iris recognition and the challenges it faces, which may lead to references of datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **main body of the text**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or literature reviews. I will look for any tables or figures that might summarize datasets used in previous studies. In the provided text, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes literature on presentation attack detection methods, which includes references to various datasets.

In **Table 1**, I will carefully note the datasets mentioned alongside their corresponding references. The table lists different types of Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs) and the associated Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) methods, along with the databases used for research purposes.

I will extract the following datasets from the table:

1. **Public Database**: This is mentioned multiple times in the context of various PAD methods. I will need to find specific references that detail this public database.

2. **Proprietary Database**: Similar to the public database, this is also referenced in several studies. I will look for the specific papers that describe these proprietary datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in Table 1. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the context of the research.

For example, if a dataset is linked to a specific study, I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication as per the citation format used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized for further research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets relevant to the research on presentation attack detection in iris biometrics.
