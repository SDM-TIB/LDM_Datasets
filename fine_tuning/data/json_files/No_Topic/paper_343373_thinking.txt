To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image Classification: from Linear Regression to Visual Transformer" by Weiming Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or databases used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the GasHisSDB database, which is crucial for their experiments. This indicates that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the GasHisSDB dataset. They describe it as a publicly available dataset containing 245,196 images, categorized into normal and abnormal images. The dataset is further divided into three sub-databases based on image size: Sub-database A (160x160 pixels), Sub-database B (120x120 pixels), and Sub-database C (80x80 pixels). Each sub-database has specific counts of normal and abnormal images.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GasHisSDB dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **GasHisSDB**, the citation is:
  > Weiming Hu, Chen Li, Xiaoyan Li, Md Mamunur Rahaman, Jiquan Ma, Yong Zhang, Haoyuan Chen, Wanli Liu, Changhao Sun, Yudong Yao, et al. *GasHisSDB: A new gastric histopathology image dataset for computer-aided diagnosis of gastric cancer*. Computers in Biology and Medicine, page 105207, 2022. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.105207.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GasHisSDB dataset.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
