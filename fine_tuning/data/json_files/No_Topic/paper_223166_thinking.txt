To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias Disparity in Collaborative Recommendation" by Masoud Mansoury et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they prepared a sample of a publicly-available **Yelp dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that a dataset is indeed being used, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Yelp dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. They specify that the dataset is a subset of the Yelp dataset from round 12 of the Yelp Challenge. The authors describe the characteristics of the dataset, including the number of users, ratings, and the density of the rating matrix. They also mention that the dataset includes information about user trust relationships, which is relevant for their analysis.

The authors further explain how they prepared the dataset by extracting users' gender from their names using an online tool, which adds another layer of detail to the dataset description.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as mentioned in the paper. The citation for the Yelp dataset is typically attributed to the Yelp dataset challenge, which can be referenced as follows:

- **Yelp Dataset**: 
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Since the authors do not provide a specific paper citation for the dataset, I will use the official source link provided in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation in a clear format. This will ensure that the extracted dataset information is comprehensive and properly attributed for future reference.
