To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Notions of Stationarity in Non-Smooth Optimization" by Jiajin Li, Anthony Man-Cho So, and Wing-Kin Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications or experiments** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on the introduction and later sections for specific references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of non-smooth optimization in machine learning and signal processing, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the subsequent sections.

Next, I will look for sections that might detail experiments or applications, such as **Section IV (Applications)** or any section that discusses empirical results. These sections are likely to contain references to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find that the authors mention several applications, but they do not provide specific datasets or references to datasets in the text. Instead, they discuss concepts and methodologies without citing particular datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the topics discussed. I will look for papers that are known to provide datasets in the context of non-smooth optimization or related fields.

After reviewing the references, I identify a few papers that are likely to contain datasets relevant to the research:

1. **Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems**:
   > Y. Koren, R. Bell, and C. Volinsky. "Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems." *Computer*, vol. 42, no. 8, pp. 30–37, 2009.

2. **Matrix Completion has No Spurious Local Minima**:
   > R. Ge, J. D. Lee, and T. Ma. "Matrix Completion has No Spurious Local Minima." In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29: Proceedings of the 2016 Conference*, pp. 2973–2981, 2016.

3. **Low–Rank Solutions of Linear Matrix Equations via Procrustes Flow**:
   > S. Tu, R. Boczar, M. Simchowitz, M. Soltanolkotabi, and B. Recht. "Low–Rank Solutions of Linear Matrix Equations via Procrustes Flow." In *Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2016)*, pp. 964–973, 2016.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will compile the references of these papers as potential datasets related to the research topic.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to document the datasets, ensuring to include full citations for each identified dataset or related work that may contain datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper itself does not mention specific datasets, I have identified relevant references that may contain datasets applicable to the research discussed. I will document these references accordingly.
