To extract datasets from the research paper titled "tPARAFAC2: Tracking evolving patterns in (incomplete) temporal data" by Christos Chatzis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of the tPARAFAC2 model and its application to both simulated and real datasets, which suggests that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of temporal datasets in various domains, but I need to find specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. In this section, the authors mention using two real datasets:

1. **GC-MS Dataset**: This dataset consists of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry measurements of apple wine samples, arranged as a third-order tensor with modes representing mass spectra, retention time, and wine samples.

2. **Metabolomics Dataset**: This dataset corresponds to Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements and hormone measurements from blood samples collected during a meal challenge test, arranged as a third-order tensor with modes representing subjects, metabolites, and time.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation:

- For the **GC-MS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Bro, C. A. Andersson, and H. A. Kiers. "PARAFAC2—part ii. modeling chromatographic data with retention time shifts." *Journal of Chemometrics*, vol. 13, no. 3-4, pp. 295–309, 1999.

- For the **Metabolomics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Yan, L. Li, D. Horner, P. Ebrahimi, B. Chawes, L. O. Dragsted, M. A. Rasmussen, A. K. Smilde, and E. Acar. "Characterizing human postprandial metabolic response using multiway data analysis." *Metabolomics*, vol. 20, no. 3, p. 50, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
