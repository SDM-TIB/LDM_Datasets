To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Instance-Level Annotator Reliability for Natural Language Labelling Tasks" by Maolin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of estimating annotator reliability and mention that their method is evaluated on both synthetic and real datasets. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Settings)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **2-Dimensional Datasets**: This includes three synthetic datasets referred to as "moon," "circle," and "3-class." Each of these datasets is designed to test the model's performance in a controlled environment.

2. **Question Classification Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Li and Roth (2002) and contains short questions along with the expected answer types.

3. **Sentence Classification Dataset**: This dataset is derived from Chambers (2013) and consists of sentences selected from medical publications.

4. **Recognising Textual Entailment (RTE) Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's performance in a real-world scenario and is sourced from Snow et al. (2008).

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Question Classification Dataset**:

- For the **Sentence Classification Dataset**:
  > Chambers, A. (2013). Statistical Models for Text Classification and Clustering: Applications and Analysis. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Irvine.

- For the **RTE Dataset**:
  > Snow, S., O’Connor, B., Jurafsky, D., & Ng, A. (2008). Cheap and fast – but is it good? Evaluating non-expert annotations for natural language tasks. In Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 254–263, Honolulu, Hawaii. Association for Computational Linguistics.

The **2-Dimensional Datasets** do not have specific citations as they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
