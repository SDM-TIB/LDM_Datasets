To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Penalized Deep Partially Linear Cox Models with Application to CT Scans of Lung Cancer Patients" by Yuming Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed model to the **NLST study dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **application section** (Section 5) and any **data description** within the methods. In Section 5, the authors describe the dataset from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), which includes 368 subjects diagnosed with lung cancer and screened with CT. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of patients, their demographics, and the context of the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NLST dataset. The authors reference the NLST study in the context of their analysis, which is crucial for providing a complete citation.

The full citation for the NLST dataset is:
> National Lung Screening Trial Research Team. *Reduced lung-cancer mortality with low-dose computed tomographic screening*. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(5):395â€“409, 2011.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using **pyradiomics** to extract texture features from CT scans, which indicates that the extracted features are derived from the NLST dataset. However, since pyradiomics is a tool rather than a dataset, I will not include it in the dataset extraction.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **NLST Study Dataset**: This dataset includes a total of 368 subjects diagnosed with lung cancer, with detailed clinical characteristics and outcomes related to CT screening.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that the dataset entry includes the full citation for the NLST dataset, ready for further processing or review.
