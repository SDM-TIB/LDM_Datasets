To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Structured Natural Language Representations for Semantic Parsing" by Jianpeng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on four datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **GEOQUERY**: This dataset contains 880 questions and database queries about US geography. The authors note that the utterances are compositional, but the language is simple and the vocabulary size is small.

2. **SPADES**: This dataset consists of 93,319 questions derived from CLUEWEB09 sentences. The questions were created by randomly removing an entity from the sentences, resulting in sentence-denotation pairs.

3. **WEBQUESTIONS**: This dataset includes 5,810 question-answer pairs based on Freebase. The questions are real questions asked by people on the web, but they are not very compositional.

4. **GRAPHQUESTIONS**: This dataset contains 5,166 question-answer pairs created by paraphrasing Freebase graph queries into natural language.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **GEOQUERY**, the citation is:

- For **SPADES**, the citation is:

- For **WEBQUESTIONS**, the citation is:

- For **GRAPHQUESTIONS**, the citation is:
  > Su, Z., Sun, H., Sadler, B., Srivatsa, M., Gur, I., Yan, Z., & Yan, X. (2016). On generating characteristic-rich question sets for QA evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 562–572.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
