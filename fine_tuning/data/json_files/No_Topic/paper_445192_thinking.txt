To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Linear Programming Enhanced Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning" by Ankur Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they tested their approach on **two datasets, MNIST and CIFAR-10**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant for the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were used. In the results section, the authors provide a description of the datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training data points and 10,000 testing data points, containing images of handwritten digits (28 × 28 pixel gray-scale images). The authors mention that they randomly sampled 5,000 data points for training and 2,500 for validation.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset includes 50,000 training data points and 10,000 testing data points, with each data point being a 32 × 32 pixel colored image of an object. Similar to MNIST, they randomly sampled 5,000 data points for training and 2,500 for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
