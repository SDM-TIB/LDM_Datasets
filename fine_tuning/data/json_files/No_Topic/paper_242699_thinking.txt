To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Long Context for Task-Oriented Dialogue State Generation" by Jun Quan and Deyi Xiong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the **MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets & Settings)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset** in detail, describing it as the largest multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset, consisting of over 10,000 dialogues from seven domains.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset** is as follows:
> Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Iñigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gašić. *MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5016–5026, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset** for its experiments, I will ensure to highlight this dataset in my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset** and ensure that it is ready for any further processing or review.
