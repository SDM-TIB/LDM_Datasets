To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Document Embedding in Research Paper Recommender Systems: To Break Down or to Bolster Disciplinary Borders?" by Eoghan Cunningham et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a citation graph using Semantic Scholar citation information for 58,513 research papers, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly section 3 (Data), where the authors describe the process of constructing the citation graph. They detail the selection of topics and the sampling of articles, which provides insight into the dataset's composition.

The dataset described is:

1. **Citation Graph Dataset**: This dataset consists of a citation network constructed from 58,513 research papers across various scientific disciplines. The authors explain the methodology used to collect and filter the articles, ensuring a densely-connected, multidisciplinary citation graph.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset itself does not have a dedicated citation in the references, as it is derived from Semantic Scholar data. Therefore, I will cite the source of the data:

- For the **Semantic Scholar citation information**, the citation is:
  > Cohan, A., Feldman, S., Beltagy, I., Downey, D., Weld, D.S. (2020). *SPECTER: Document-level representation learning using citation-informed transformers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07180.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and its citation for future reference.
