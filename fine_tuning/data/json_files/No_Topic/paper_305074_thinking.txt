To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recognizing Facial Expressions in the Wild using Multi-Architectural Representations based Ensemble Learning with Distillation" by Rauf Momin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved test accuracy on **FER2013** and **RAF-DB**, which suggests these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) in detail, as this section typically provides explicit information about the datasets used. Here, the authors describe the **FER-2013 dataset** as containing around 35,887 grayscale images with FER+ annotations and the **RAF-DB** as a large-scale facial expression database with around 30,000 images. They also mention the specific characteristics of these datasets, such as image dimensions and the number of classes.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **FER-2013 dataset**, the citation is:
   > I. J. Goodfellow et al., “Challenges in Representation Learning: A Report on Three Machine Learning Contests,” in Neural Information Processing, 2013, pp. 117–124.

2. For the **RAF-DB**, the citation is:
   > S. Li, W. Deng, and J. Du, “Reliable Crowdsourcing and Deep Locality-Preserving Learning for Expression Recognition in the Wild,” in 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2584–2593, 2017. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2017.277.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FER-2013**: A dataset containing 35,887 grayscale images of size 48x48 pixels, used for facial expression recognition with updated FER+ annotations.
- **RAF-DB**: A large-scale facial expression database with approximately 30,000 images, specifically using single-labeled images converted to 48x48 pixels for consistency.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
