To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Algorithm for Non-stationary Contextual Bandits" by Yifang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **"Datasets" or "Experiments" section** within the paper. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of the datasets from there.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. Authors often mention datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results to previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down the **full citations** for each dataset. This information is typically found in the **References section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, as these citations are crucial for proper attribution.

For each dataset, I will document the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including its size, type, and any specific features.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
