To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MotàMot project: conversion of a French-Khmer published dictionary for building a multilingual lexical system" by Mathieu Mangeot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project, indicating that it involves the conversion of a French-Khmer bilingual dictionary into a multilingual lexical system. This suggests that the dictionary itself is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in **section 1 (Introduction)**. Here, the author discusses the goals of the MotàMot project, emphasizing the computerization of the Khmer language and the development of a multilingual lexical system. However, I need to find explicit references to datasets.

In **section 3 (Preparation of existing data)**, the author describes the conversion of the French-Khmer dictionary into XML format. This section is crucial as it details the original dataset used for the project. The paper mentions that the original French-Khmer dictionary contains 13,249 entries, which is a significant dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original French-Khmer dictionary, as it is essential to provide proper attribution. The citation is as follows:

- Richer, D., Keo, T., & Vania, I. (2007). *Dictionnaire Français-Khmer (en phonétique)*. D.R. Edition, ISBN-13: 890-0-9.

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions the use of the Jibiki platform for hosting the lexical resource, but it does not specify additional datasets beyond the French-Khmer dictionary.

Now, I will compile the identified dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the French-Khmer dictionary as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the French-Khmer dictionary, and its citation is crucial for proper acknowledgment in any subsequent use or reference.
