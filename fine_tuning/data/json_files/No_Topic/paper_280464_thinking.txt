To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Discourse Structures using a Tree Autoencoder" by Patrick Huber and Giuseppe Carenini, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for high-quality discourse treebanks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction discusses the limitations of current discourse parsers and the need for larger datasets, indicating that the authors may reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **RST-DT Treebank**: This dataset is noted as the most popular RST treebank, containing 385 documents from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, with a specific split for training and testing. The authors mention that each document is annotated with a complete discourse tree according to RST theory.

2. **Yelp’13 Dataset**: This dataset consists of restaurant reviews and is part of the 2013 Yelp Dataset Challenge. It has been pre-segmented into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) and contains a large number of documents, which are also split into training, development, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **RST-DT Treebank**, the citation is:
  > Carlson, L., Marcu, D., & Okurowski, M. E. (2001). Building a discourse-tagged corpus in the framework of Rhetorical Structure Theory. In Proceedings of the Second SIGdial Workshop on Discourse and Dialogue-Volume 16, 1–10.

- For the **Yelp’13 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tang, D., Qin, B., & Liu, T. (2015). Document modeling with gated recurrent neural network for sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 2015 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, 1422–1432.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
