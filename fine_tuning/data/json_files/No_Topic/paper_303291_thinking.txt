To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Surgical task expertise detected by a self-organizing neural network map" by B. Dresp-Langley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on grip force profiling, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to grip force data from surgical tasks.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets or prior work that may have utilized datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of grip force profiling and mentions previous work that has exploited sensor data, which could indicate the existence of datasets.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the data collection process, stating that they analyzed a total of **239,710 grip force data points** sampled from a surgical expert and a novice performing a robot-assisted simulator task. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset, including the number of data points and the context in which they were collected.

I will also look for any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or provide additional context. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates sensor locations, which may help in understanding the data collection process.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the variability of grip forces and how it relates to task expertise, which further confirms the significance of the dataset in their analysis.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references previous works that may have utilized similar datasets, such as:

1. **Grip Force Data from Surgical Simulators**: While the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, it refers to grip force data collected from a robotic control device designed for endoscopic surgery. The relevant citation for this work is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
