To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-elitist Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimizers Revisited" by Ryoji Tanabe and Hisao Ishibuchi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the performance of evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) is evaluated on the **bi-objective BBOB problem suite** provided by the COCO platform. This suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **experimental settings** section (Section 3) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **bi-objective BBOB problem suite** and provide details about it, including that it consists of 55 bi-objective test problems designed based on previous work. This is a clear indication of a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **COCO platform** and the **bi-objective BBOB problem suite**. The relevant citations are:

- For the **COCO platform**:
  > N. Hansen, A. Auger, O. Mersmann, T. Tusar, and D. Brockhoff. 2016. COCO: A Platform for Comparing Continuous Optimizers in a Black-Box Setting. CoRR abs/1603.08785 (2016).

- For the **bi-objective BBOB problem suite**:
  > T. Tusar, D. Brockhoff, N. Hansen, and A. Auger. 2016. COCO: The Bi-objective Black Box Optimization Benchmarking (bbob-biobj) Test Suite. CoRR abs/1604.00359 (2016).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Bi-objective BBOB problem suite
   - **Description**: A suite consisting of 55 bi-objective test problems designed for benchmarking continuous optimizers.
   - **Full Citation**: T. Tusar, D. Brockhoff, N. Hansen, and A. Auger. 2016. COCO: The Bi-objective Black Box Optimization Benchmarking (bbob-biobj) Test Suite. CoRR abs/1604.00359 (2016).

2. **Dataset Name**: COCO platform
   - **Description**: A platform used for comparing continuous optimizers in a black-box setting.
   - **Full Citation**: N. Hansen, A. Auger, O. Mersmann, T. Tusar, and D. Brockhoff. 2016. COCO: A Platform for Comparing Continuous Optimizers in a Black-Box Setting. CoRR abs/1603.08785 (2016).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
