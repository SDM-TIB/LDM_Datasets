To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning-enabled Freeway Decision-making for Automated Vehicles" by Teng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may list the datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide results based on specific datasets. I will look for any descriptions or comparisons that mention datasets directly. If the authors refer to any datasets by name, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the freeway decision-making problem for autonomous vehicles, as indicated in the title and abstract. I will also note any specific simulation environments or benchmarks that the authors may have used.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.
