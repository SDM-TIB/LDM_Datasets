To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Short Text Classification with Knowledge Powered Attention" by Jindong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the datasets are discussed. In this paper, the authors mention four datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Chinese Weibo Emotion Analysis Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from NLPCC2013 and contains 7 kinds of emotions in Weibo posts. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Product Review Dataset**: This dataset is from NLPCC2014 and consists of product reviews classified into binary polarity (positive or negative). It also has specified training, validation, and test splits.

3. **Chinese News Title Dataset**: This dataset is from NLPCC2017 and includes 18 classes of news titles. The authors provide details about the training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Topic Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Sogou news and focuses on short texts with an average word length of 7.99. It includes titles as short texts and topics as labels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Chinese Weibo Emotion Analysis Dataset**:

- For the **Product Review Dataset**:
  > Zhou, Y., Xu, R., & Gui, L. (2017). A sequence level latent topic modeling method for sentiment analysis via CNN based diversified restricted Boltzmann machine. In International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, pages 356–361.

- For the **Chinese News Title Dataset**:
  > Qiu, X., Gong, J., & Huang, X. (2017). Overview of the NLPCC 2017 shared task: Chinese news headline categorization. In National CCF Conference on Natural Language Processing and Chinese Computing, pages 948–953.

- For the **Topic Dataset**:
  > Fu, J., Qiu, J., Wang, J., & Li, L. (2015). Name disambiguation using semi-supervised topic model. In International Conference on Intelligent Computing, pages 471–480.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
