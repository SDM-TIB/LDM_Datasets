To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Dynamic MRI Reconstruction Using Low-Rank Plus Sparse Decomposition with Smoothness Regularization," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of dynamic MRI and the challenges faced in reconstruction. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets that may have been used in previous studies or as benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a comparison of their proposed method against existing methods. Here, they mention two specific datasets used for evaluation:

1. **PINCAT Dataset**: This dataset is described as a physiologically enhanced non-uniform cardiac torso numerical phantom data. It is used in various studies, including those by Lingala et al. (2011) and Lin and Fessler (2018). The authors specify that the ground-truth PINCAT data has a spatial dimension of 128 × 128 with 50 temporal frames.

2. **Cardiac Perfusion MRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of in vivo cardiac perfusion MRI data, also referenced in studies by Otazo et al. (2015) and Lin and Fessler (2018). The authors mention that this dataset has images of size 128 × 128 with 40 temporal frames.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **PINCAT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sajan Goud Lingala, Yue Hu, Edward DiBella, and Mathews Jacob. *Accelerated dynamic MRI exploiting sparsity and low-rank structure: kt SLR*. IEEE Trans. Med. Imag., 30(5):1042–1054, 2011.

- For the **Cardiac Perfusion MRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ricardo Otazo, Daniel Kim, Leon Axel, and Daniel K Sodickson. *Combination of compressed sensing and parallel imaging for highly accelerated first-pass cardiac perfusion MRI*. Magn. Res. Med., 64(3):767–776, 2010.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
