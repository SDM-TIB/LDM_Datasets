To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skeptical binary inferences in multi-label problems" by Yonatan Carlos Carranza Alarcón and Sébastien Destercke, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets, typically labeled as "Datasets," "Experiments," or similar. In this paper, I will focus on sections that detail the experiments conducted, as they often describe the datasets used for evaluation.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific details provided by the authors, such as the number of instances, features, and any unique characteristics of the datasets.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Compile Dataset Citations**: I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that I include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Summarize Findings**: Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data sources utilized in the study.
