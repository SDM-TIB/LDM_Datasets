To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SKU-Patch: Towards Efficient Instance Segmentation for Unseen Objects in Auto-Store" by Biqi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that extensive experiments were conducted on four storehouse benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **AutoStore dataset** and the **RPC dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, structure, and any unique characteristics.

In the **AutoStore dataset** subsection, the authors describe it as containing 1,000 images of 50 different supermarket SKUs, with each SKU accompanied by five representative patches. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, particularly for unseen SKU segmentation.

In the **RPC dataset** subsection, the authors mention that it includes 30,000 images containing 367,935 instances across 200 retail SKUs. This dataset is also significant for their evaluation of the SKU-Patch method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **AutoStore dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wei, X.-S., Cui, Q., Yang, L., Wang, P., & Liu, L. (2019). RPC: A large-scale retail product checkout dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07249*.

2. For the **RPC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wei, X.-S., Cui, Q., Yang, L., Wang, P., & Liu, L. (2019). RPC: A large-scale retail product checkout dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07249*.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
