To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Algorithmic Framework for Fairness Elicitation" by Christopher Jung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report findings from a behavioral study using the **COMPAS criminal recidivism dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the **COMPAS dataset** again, emphasizing its relevance to their study on fairness in algorithmic decision-making.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 5.1 (Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **COMPAS recidivism dataset**. They explain that it consists of data from defendants in Broward County, Florida, and includes various features such as sex, age, race, and criminal history. This section confirms that the dataset is used for their behavioral study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **COMPAS dataset**. The authors reference the original source of the dataset, which is from ProPublica's analysis of the COMPAS algorithm. The citation is as follows:

> ProPublica. *How We Analyzed the COMPAS Recidivism Algorithm*. March 2019. Available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry. The dataset extracted is:

1. **COMPAS Recidivism Dataset**: This dataset includes records of defendants from Broward County, Florida, containing features such as sex, age, race, and criminal history, used to study fairness in algorithmic decision-making.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution.
