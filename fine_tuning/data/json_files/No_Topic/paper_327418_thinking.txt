To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Look at Dynamic Regret for Non-Stationary Stochastic Bandits" by Yasin Abbasi-Yadkori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may mention datasets used in previous studies, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check for mentions of datasets used in the evaluation of the proposed methods. This section often confirms which datasets were utilized and may provide additional context about their significance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to non-stationary stochastic bandits, as the title suggests a focus on this area. If the authors reference any well-known datasets, I will ensure to include those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Identify datasets used in the experiments and their characteristics.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
