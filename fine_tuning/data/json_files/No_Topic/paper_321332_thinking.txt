To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum-Assisted Support Vector Regression for Detecting Facial Landmarks" by Archismita Dalal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for training and testing the models.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on."

In the **methodology section**, particularly under subsections that discuss the experimental setup or data collection, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section typically includes information about the number of samples, the nature of the data (e.g., images, annotations), and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors mention the datasets again when discussing their findings. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From the paper, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of images for training and testing the facial landmark detection models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > G. B. Huang, M. Mattar, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In Workshop on Faces in 'Real-Life' Images: Detection, Alignment, and Recognition, 2008.

2. **Labeled Face Parts in the Wild (LFPW)**: This dataset is also referenced for testing the models. The citation is:
   > V. Le, J. Brandt, Z. Lin, L. Bourdev, and T. S. Huang. *Interactive facial feature localization*. In European conference on computer vision, 2012.

3. **BioID Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another source for testing the models. The citation is:
   > O. Jesorsky, K. J. Kirchberg, and R. W. Frischholz. *Robust face detection using the Hausdorff distance*. In International conference on audio-and video-based biometric person authentication, 2001.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
