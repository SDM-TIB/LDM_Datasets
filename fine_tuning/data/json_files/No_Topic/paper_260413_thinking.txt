To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P 2 Net: Augmented Parallel-Pyramid Net for Attention Guided Pose Estimation" by Luanxuan Hou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves the best performance on the **MSCOCO** and **MPII** datasets, indicating that these datasets are used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and validation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MSCOCO Dataset**: The authors state that their models are trained on the MSCOCO train dataset, which includes 57K images and 150K person instances with 17 keypoints. They also mention the validation set, which includes 5K images.

2. **MPII Dataset**: The authors also refer to the MPII dataset in their experiments, although they do not provide detailed statistics in this section.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MSCOCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For the **MPII Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Andriluka, S. Pishchulin, P. Gehler, and B. Schiele. *2D Human Pose Estimation: New Benchmark and State of the Art Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3686–3693, 2014.

With this information, I have successfully identified the datasets used in the paper and their corresponding citations. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.
