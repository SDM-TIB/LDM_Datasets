To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Design of Heuristics for the Container Relocation Problem" by Marko Ðurasevi´c and Mateja Ðumi´c, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the container relocation problem (CRP) and mention that heuristic methods are applied to obtain solutions. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for testing their proposed method. They refer to two datasets: 

1. **Caserta Dataset**: This dataset contains 840 instances with varying numbers of stacks and containers per stack, specifically designed for testing the proposed method.

2. **Zhu Dataset**: This dataset contains 125,000 instances with different configurations compared to the Caserta dataset, providing a broader range of problems for evaluation.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their characteristics.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed as datasets but could be found in the context of the papers that introduced them.

For the **Caserta Dataset**, the citation is:
> M. Caserta, S. Voß, and M. Sniedovich. "Applying the corridor method to a blocks relocation problem." *OR Spectrum*, vol. 33, no. 4, pp. 915–929, 2011.

For the **Zhu Dataset**, the citation is:
> W. Zhu, H. Qin, A. Lim, and H. Zhang. "Iterative deepening A* algorithms for the container relocation problem." *IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering*, vol. 9, no. 4, pp. 710–722, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
