To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DE-CGAN: Boosting rTMS Treatment Prediction with Diversity Enhancing Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks" by Matthew Squires et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic data to enhance the diversity of training datasets for predicting rTMS treatment outcomes, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the challenges of model generalization due to the lack of diverse datasets in psychiatry. They reference previous works that utilized fMRI connectivity features, which indicates that there may be datasets related to these features.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 3.2 (Problem Definition)**, the authors define the real patients' dataset as Dreal, which includes fMRI connectivity features. They also mention the generation of synthetic patients and their class labels, denoted as Dsynth. This section is crucial as it outlines the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for specific references to datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.2 (Dataset)**, the authors state that the original data used in their work is publicly available in Hopman et al. [7, 57]. This indicates that I need to retrieve the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned:

- For the dataset referenced from Hopman et al., the citation is:
  > Hopman, H.J., Chan, S.M.S., Chu, W.C.W., Lu, H., Tse, C.-Y., Chau, S.W.H., Lam, L.C.W., Mak, A.D.P., Neggers, S.F.W. (2021). *Personalized prediction of transcranial magnetic stimulation clinical response in patients with treatment-refractory depression using neuroimaging biomarkers and machine learning*. Journal of Affective Disorders, 290, 261â€“271. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.04.081

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dreal**: The original dataset containing fMRI connectivity features and patient outcomes, sourced from Hopman et al. [7, 57].
2. **Dsynth**: The synthetic dataset generated by the DE-CGAN framework, which is not explicitly cited as it is a product of the authors' methodology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
