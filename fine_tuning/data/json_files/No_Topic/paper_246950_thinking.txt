To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Common Sense" by Alexander Gavrilenko and Katerina Morozova, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I identify and accurately cite any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and any datasets used for training or evaluation. This section is crucial as it often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will review it to confirm the datasets used and how they were applied in the experiments. This will help me understand the context in which the datasets were utilized.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Open Mind Common Sense," I would look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. The citation might look something like this:
> Singh, P., Lin, T., Mueller, E., Lim, G., Perkins, T., and Zhu, W. "Open Mind Common Sense: Knowledge acquisition from the general public." In OTM Confederated International Conferences "On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems," Berlin: Springer, pages 1223â€“1237, 2002.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper citations for each.
