To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Applications in Lung Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment and Prognosis" by Yawei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning to analyze large and complex datasets related to lung cancer, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss methodologies and experiments**, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. I will look for sections that detail the types of data used, such as imaging datasets or -omics datasets, as these are likely to be the datasets of interest.

In the **results or discussion sections**, I will look for any specific names of datasets that were utilized in the studies or analyses presented. The paper may refer to well-known datasets in the field of lung cancer research, such as TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) or TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive).

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the TCGA dataset, I would look for its citation, which is typically formatted as follows:
> N. Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., "The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer analysis project," Nat Genet, vol. 45, no. 10, pp. 1113-20, Oct 2013, doi: 10.1038/ng.2764.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and correctly formatted, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
