To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differentiable Programming `a la Moreau" by Vincent Roulet and Zaid Harchaoui, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to well-known datasets in the field.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will pay attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their size, type, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets used in the analysis of results. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the text, ensuring that I capture the correct authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
