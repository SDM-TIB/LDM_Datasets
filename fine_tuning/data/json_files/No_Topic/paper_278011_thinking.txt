To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A 3-Dimensional Simplex Modulation Format with Improved OSNR Performance Compared to DP-BPSK" by Annika Dochhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it does not mention any datasets directly. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the modulation formats and their performance but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **system setup and experiments sections** to look for any experimental data or datasets used in their evaluations.

In the **system setup**, the authors describe the experimental configuration but do not mention specific datasets. However, in the **experiments section**, they detail the experimental results and mention that they conducted tests using a 300 km standard single-mode fiber. They refer to the performance of the 3D-Simplex modulation format compared to DP-DPSK but do not provide specific datasets.

Next, I will check the **results section** for any numerical data or datasets that may have been used in the experiments. The results section includes figures and tables showing the performance metrics but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references include various papers related to modulation formats and performance evaluations, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for analysis or experiments, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses experimental results and comparisons, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none identified in the text.
