To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gastrointestinal Disease Classification through Explainable and Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Networks with Supervised Contrastive Learning" by Dibya Nath and G. M. Shahariar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Hyper-Kvasir dataset** for evaluating the proposed approach, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 5.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **Hyper-Kvasir dataset**. They explain that it is a comprehensive collection of gastrointestinal endoscopy images and videos, including annotations for various abnormalities. The dataset contains 110,079 images, with 10,662 images labeled into 23 distinct classes. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details about its contents.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Hyper-Kvasir dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Borgli, H., Thambawita, V., Smedsrud, P.H., Hicks, S., Jha, D., Eskeland, S.L., Randel, K.R., Pogorelov, K., Lux, M., Nguyen, D.T.D., et al. *Hyperkvasir, a comprehensive multi-class image and video dataset for gastrointestinal endoscopy*. Scientific data 7(1), 283 (2020).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Reviewing the dataset description in section 5.1 for detailed information.
3. Locating the full citation in the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
