To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Qualitative detection of oil adulteration with machine learning approaches" by Xiao-Bo Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the study involved extracting HPLC data from 370 oil samples, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction discusses the importance of detecting oil adulteration and mentions various chromatographic methods, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly **section 2.2 (Sample preparation)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of nine kinds of edible vegetable oil collected from Henan and Shandong provinces in China, totaling 370 examples with 1607 dimensions. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used in the study.

In the **Results and Discussion** section, the authors discuss the performance of their methods on the dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments. However, they do not provide additional datasets or references to other datasets.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. The paper does not cite any specific dataset references, but it does reference various studies that utilized similar methods or datasets in the context of oil adulteration detection.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entry as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: HPLC Data of Edible Oils
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 370 examples of nine types of edible vegetable oils, including soybean, peanut, sunflower, corn, palm, sesame, cotton, rapeseed, and rice bran oils. The dataset includes HPLC data on triglycerides with 1607 dimensions.
   - **Citation**: The dataset does not have a specific citation as it is original data collected by the authors.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that the citation is included for any referenced datasets, even if they are not explicitly named in the paper.
