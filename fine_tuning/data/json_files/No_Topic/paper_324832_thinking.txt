To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RVS: What is Essential for Offline RL via Supervised Learning?" by Scott Emmons et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Tasks and Datasets)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe several environments and datasets:

1. **GCSL**: A suite of goal-conditioned environments adapted from Ghosh et al. (2021). This includes tasks like FourRooms, Door, Pusher, Lander, and Claw.

2. **Gym Locomotion v2**: This includes datasets for HalfCheetah, Hopper, and Walker from the D4RL offline RL benchmark.

3. **Franka Kitchen v0**: A robotic manipulation task with three datasets: complete, partial, and mixed.

4. **AntMaze v2**: A task involving an 8-DoF quadruped with datasets for umaze, medium, and large mazes, including diverse and play types.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are crucial for proper attribution.

For the **GCSL** dataset, the citation is:

For the **D4RL** datasets, the citation is:

For the **Franka Kitchen** dataset, the citation is:
> Gupta, A., Kumar, V., Lynch, C., Levine, S., & Hausman, K. (2020). Relay policy learning: Solving long-horizon tasks via imitation and reinforcement learning. In Conference on Robot Learning.

For the **AntMaze** dataset, the citation is:
> Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for deep data-driven reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.07219.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
