To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A fractional-order difference Cournot duopoly game with long memory" by Baogui Xin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical simulation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical framework and the motivation behind their research but do not mention any datasets. I will continue to the **numerical simulation section**, as this is where datasets are often utilized for validation and testing.

In the **numerical simulation section**, the authors describe their methodology and the parameters used for their simulations. They mention using specific values for parameters like ν, α1, α2, b, d, c1, and c2, but they do not refer to any external datasets. Instead, they seem to be using theoretical constructs and simulations rather than empirical data from datasets.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature. However, upon reviewing the references, it appears that the citations primarily focus on theoretical works and previous studies related to game theory and fractional calculus, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to datasets used in their analysis, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "A fractional-order difference Cournot duopoly game with long memory" by Baogui Xin et al. and provide the citation for the paper itself:

- Baogui Xin, Wei Peng, Yekyung Kwon. *A fractional-order difference Cournot duopoly game with long memory*. [Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year]. (Note: Replace placeholders with actual journal details if available).

This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and understanding of the paper to accurately identify the presence or absence of datasets.
