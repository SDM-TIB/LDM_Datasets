To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shifting More Attention to Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Videos" by Junhao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a **US video breast lesion segmentation dataset** comprising **572 videos and 34,300 annotated frames**. This indicates that a new dataset has been introduced, which is crucial for my extraction.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this case, the **section 2 (Ultrasound Video Breast Lesion Segmentation Dataset)** provides comprehensive information about the dataset. Here, I will note the key details:

1. **US Video Breast Lesion Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset contains **572 videos** with **34,300 annotated frames**. It includes annotations for breast lesions and is designed to support advancements in breast lesion segmentation and axillary lymph node metastasis prediction.

I will also check for any references to existing datasets that the authors compare their dataset against. In the introduction, they mention a previous dataset by Li et al. (2022), which is relevant for citation purposes.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both the new dataset and the referenced dataset:

- For the **US Video Breast Lesion Segmentation Dataset**, since it is newly created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Junhao Lin, Qian Dai, Lei Zhu, Li Huazhu, Wenhao Rao, Xiaoyang Huang, Huazhu Fu, Qiong Wang, Weibin, and Liansheng Wang. *Shifting More Attention to Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Videos*. In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2023.

- For the **dataset by Li et al. (2022)**, the citation is:
  > Li, J., Zheng, Q., Li, M., Liu, P., Wang, Q., Sun, L., and Zhu, L. *Rethinking breast lesion segmentation in ultrasound: A new video dataset and a baseline network*. In Proceedings of the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), pages 391â€“400, 2022.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that all necessary details are included and correctly formatted.
