To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curvature-Exploiting Acceleration of Elastic Net Computations" by Vien V. Mai and Mikael Johansson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they performed numerical experiments on several real-world datasets. Specifically, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often contain key information.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four datasets in Table 2:

1. **gisette-scale**: This dataset has 5,000 features and 6,000 samples.
2. **australian**: This dataset has 14 features and 690 samples.
3. **cina0**: This dataset has 132 features and 16,033 samples.
4. **realsim**: This dataset has 20,958 features and 72,309 samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may reference the original sources of these datasets, which is crucial for proper documentation.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For **gisette-scale**:
  > Isabelle Guyon, Constantin Aliferis, Greg Cooper, André Elisseeff, Jean-Philippe Pellet, Peter Spirtes, and Alexander Statnikov. *Design and analysis of the causation and prediction challenge*. In Causation and Prediction Challenge, pages 1–33, 2008.

- For **australian**:
  > Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM transactions on intelligent systems and technology (TIST), 2(3):27, 2011.

- For **cina0**:
  > The dataset is referenced in the context of a specific study, but the citation is not provided in the text. I will need to look for the original source or dataset repository.

- For **realsim**:
  > The dataset is also referenced in the context of a specific study, but the citation is not provided in the text. I will need to look for the original source or dataset repository.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset where available. If the citations for **cina0** and **realsim** are not found in the references, I will note that they need to be sourced from the original dataset repositories or publications.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or downstream processing, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
