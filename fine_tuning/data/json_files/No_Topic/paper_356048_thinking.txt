To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precision measurement of the return distribution property of the Chinese stock market index" by Peng Liu and Yanyan Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors analyze **1 min datasets over a 17-year period (2005-2021)** for both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, which suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their analysis. They mention:

1. **SSE Composite Index**: This dataset consists of 1-minute interval data recorded for the SSECI over a period from January 4, 2005, to December 31, 2021. The dataset aims to reflect the overall performance of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

2. **SZSE Composite Index**: Similar to the SSE Composite Index, this dataset includes 1-minute interval data for the SZSECI over the same time period. It reflects the performance of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

Both datasets contain a total of **991,680 records** for each index, which is crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from the stock exchanges and not from a specific publication, I will note that they are publicly available datasets from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **SSE Composite Index**:
  > Shanghai Stock Exchange. *SSE Composite Index Data*. Available at: [http://www.sse.com.cn](http://www.sse.com.cn)

- For the **SZSE Composite Index**:
  > Shenzhen Stock Exchange. *SZSE Composite Index Data*. Available at: [http://www.szse.cn](http://www.szse.cn)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key details and citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
