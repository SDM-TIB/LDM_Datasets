To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Computational Creativity" by Maria Teresa Llano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the paper's focus on explainable computational creativity, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments or evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the research. I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or features of each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper discusses any datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized, I will also verify their citations against existing literature to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will facilitate easy access and reference for future research or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
