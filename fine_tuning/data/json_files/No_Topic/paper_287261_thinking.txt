To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-Subject Few-Shot Neurological Symptom Detection" by Bingzhao Zhu and Mahsa Shoaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach on **intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Classification Task and Data Description)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they studied a total of **97 seizure events from 9 patients** and that the iEEG recordings were sampled at **500Hz**. They also note that the data is publicly available at the **IEEG Portal**, which is a crucial detail for citation.

In this section, the authors provide information about how the data was segmented into **1-second windows** for processing, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the IEEG Portal, which is likely the source of the dataset. I will look for the specific citation related to the IEEG Portal in the references.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Joost B Wagenaar, Gregory A Worrell, Zachary Ives, Matthias Dümpelemann, Brian Litt, and Andreas Schulze-Bonhage. "Collaborating and sharing data in epilepsy research." *Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology: Official Publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society*, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 235, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings
   - **Description**: Continuous iEEG recordings from 9 patients with epilepsy, containing 97 seizure events, sampled at 500Hz, and annotated as seizure or non-seizure by domain experts.
   - **Citation**: Joost B Wagenaar, Gregory A Worrell, Zachary Ives, Matthias Dümpelemann, Brian Litt, and Andreas Schulze-Bonhage. "Collaborating and sharing data in epilepsy research." *Journal of Clinical Neurophysiology: Official Publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society*, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 235, 2015.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
