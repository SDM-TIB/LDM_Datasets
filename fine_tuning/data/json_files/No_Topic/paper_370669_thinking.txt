To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super-Resolution Analysis via Machine Learning: A Survey for Fluid Flows" by Kai Fukami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on super-resolution reconstruction for vortical flows, which may hint at the types of datasets used. The introduction will likely elaborate on the context and significance of the datasets in the research.

Next, I will examine the **case study** section (section 4) closely, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors discuss a case study involving two-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to this turbulence analysis.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize datasets or provide additional context about the data used in the experiments. For instance, if there is a table listing various studies and their corresponding datasets, that would be crucial for my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset related to "two-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence," I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If the dataset is derived from a specific study or simulation, I will ensure to capture the complete citation.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of each dataset in the context of the research conducted in the paper.
