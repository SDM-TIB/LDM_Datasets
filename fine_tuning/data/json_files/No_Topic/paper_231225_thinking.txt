To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graph Transfer Network for Few-Shot Recognition" by Riquan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **ImageNet dataset** and constructing an **ImageNet-6K dataset**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **Datasets section** of the paper, which is explicitly labeled. Here, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ImageNet-FS**: This dataset covers 1,000 categories from ILSVRC2012, divided into 389 base categories and 611 novel categories. Each base category has approximately 1,280 training images and 50 test images.

2. **ImageNet-6K**: This newly constructed dataset includes 6,000 categories, consisting of 1,000 categories from the ImageNet 2012 dataset as base categories and 5,000 novel categories selected from the ImageNet 2011 dataset. Each category has 50 test samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **ImageNet-6K**, since it is a newly constructed dataset by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source:
  > Riquan Chen, Tianshui Chen, Xiaolu Hui, Hefeng Wu, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin. *Knowledge Graph Transfer Network for Few-Shot Recognition*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
