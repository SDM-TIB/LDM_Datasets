To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Visual Fault Detection for Freight Train via Neural Architecture Search with Data Volume Robustness" by Yang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors achieved competitive performance on the **Bottom View** and **Side View** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they mention two specific datasets used for fault detection of freight trains:

1. **Bottom View Dataset**: This dataset includes various components of freight trains, with a total of 7,000 images split into training and validation sets. The authors provide a breakdown of the number of images for each component.

2. **Side View Dataset**: Similar to the Bottom View dataset, this dataset also contains images of different train components, with a total of 4,000 images, also split into training and validation sets.

In the **experiments setup** section, the authors describe how they manually annotated the images and split them into training and testing datasets, which confirms the datasets' relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely original datasets created by the authors for this research. Therefore, I will create citations based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For the **Bottom View Dataset**:
  > Zhang, Y., Li, M., Pan, H., Liu, M., & Zhou, Y. (2024). *Bottom View Dataset for Visual Fault Detection of Freight Trains*. Unpublished dataset.

- For the **Side View Dataset**:
  > Zhang, Y., Li, M., Pan, H., Liu, M., & Zhou, Y. (2024). *Side View Dataset for Visual Fault Detection of Freight Trains*. Unpublished dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
