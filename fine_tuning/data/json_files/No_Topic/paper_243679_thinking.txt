To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tree! I am no Tree! I am a Low Dimensional Hyperbolic Embedding" by Rishi Sonthalia and Anna C. Gilbert, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including details about their size, type, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of single-cell genomic data, social network analysis, or any other applications mentioned in the introduction. The authors may refer to publicly available datasets or datasets they have created for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "scRNA-seq data" or "immunological distances," I will look for the original sources of these datasets in the references. If the datasets are publicly available, I will note the URLs or DOIs provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, description, and any relevant details about its use in the study.
