To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certified Data Removal from Machine Learning Models" by Chuan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of data removal in machine learning models, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that many computer-vision models are trained on images provided by Flickr users, referencing Thomee et al. (2016). This indicates the use of a dataset but does not provide a specific name.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. The authors use it in their experiments with logistic regression.
   
2. **LSUN**: This dataset is used for scene classification tasks. The authors mention that they extract features using a ResNeXt-101 model trained on a large number of Instagram images.

3. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks, specifically for predicting whether a movie review is positive or negative.

4. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is used for digit classification tasks, particularly in the context of differentially private feature extractors.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (1998). *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., & Koltun, V. (2015). *Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions*. In Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 128â€“135.

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2019). *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while maintaining proper academic referencing.
