To extract datasets from the research paper titled "United We Stand: Decentralized Multi-Agent Planning With Attrition" by Nhat Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm in realistic data-harvesting problems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that explicitly name datasets or provide details about their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a dataset related to underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN) for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset in the text. I will need to check the **references section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that align with the experiments conducted in this paper.

In the references, I will look for papers that might describe datasets used in similar contexts, particularly those related to multi-agent systems or data collection in underwater environments. If I find relevant citations, I will extract the full citation for each dataset.

For example, if I find a reference to a dataset like "Data collection in underwater sensor networks based on mobile edge computing," I will note the citation as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Underwater Sensor Network Dataset
  > Cai, S., Zhu, Y., Wang, T., Xu, G., Liu, A., & Liu, X. (2019). Data collection in underwater sensor networks based on mobile edge computing. *IEEE Access*, 7, 65357-65367.

If there are multiple datasets mentioned, I will repeat this process for each one, ensuring that I capture the dataset name and its full citation accurately.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
