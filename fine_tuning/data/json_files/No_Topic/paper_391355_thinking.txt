To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Spoken Named Entity Recognition: A Cross-Lingual Perspective" by Moncef Benaicha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the use of "custom pseudo-annotated datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Corpus Overview)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they relied on data from **Common Voice 12.02** for their experimental work. They describe how they utilized the validated corpus from each language (Dutch, English, and German) and implemented preprocessing measures. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset used.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **methodology** sections. The authors refer to using the **CoNLL 2002 and 2003 datasets** for training their NER model, which is another important dataset to note.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Common Voice 12.02**: This dataset is developed by Mozilla and is publicly available. The citation is:
   > Mozilla. *Common Voice*. Available at: https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets.

2. **CoNLL 2002 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > E. F. T. K. Sang. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2002 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. 2002.

3. **CoNLL 2003 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > E. F. T. K. Sang and F. D. Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. 2003.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that reflects the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
