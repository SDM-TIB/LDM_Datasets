To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural parameter calibration for large-scale multi-agent models" by Thomas Gaskin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's application to both synthetic time series data from the SIR model and real data of economic activity across Greater London. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to parameter estimation using neural networks. They mention using synthetic data generated by an agent-based model of epidemics, specifically the SIR model, and real data from the Harris-Wilson model of economic activity in Greater London. This confirms the presence of two datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **Synthetic Time Series Data**: This dataset is generated from an agent-based model of the SIR epidemic, which includes parameters such as infection probability and recovery time. The authors specify that the dataset contains 100 time steps.

2. **Economic Activity Data**: This dataset includes origin zone sizes and destination zone sizes for 625 electoral wards in Greater London, as well as transport metrics derived from the Google Distance Matrix API. The authors provide specific details about how the data was compiled and the sources used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SIR model dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. A. Pavliotis, A. M. Stuart, "Parameter estimation for multiscale diffusions," *Journal of Statistical Physics*, vol. 127, pp. 741-781, 2007.

- For the **Harris-Wilson model dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. Harris, A. G. Wilson, "Equilibrium values and dynamics of attractiveness terms in production-constrained spatial-interaction models," *Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space*, vol. 10, pp. 371-388, 1978.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
