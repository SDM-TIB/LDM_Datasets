To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Optimization with Importance Sampling" by Peilin Zhao and Tong Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets in their experiments. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **ijcnn1 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed algorithms. It consists of 49,990 instances and is commonly used in machine learning benchmarks.

2. **kdd2010 Dataset**: This is a larger dataset with 8,407,752 instances, used for testing the scalability and efficiency of the proposed methods.

3. **w8a Dataset**: This dataset contains 49,749 instances and is also used for performance evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. If the datasets are well-known, I may also look for their citations in other literature or online repositories.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **ijcnn1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Thorsten Joachims. *Making large-scale SVM learning practical*. In Advances in Kernel Methods - Support Vector Learning, 1999.

- For the **kdd2010 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > KDD Cup 2010. *KDD Cup 2010 Data*. Available at: http://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2010/track-1.

- For the **w8a Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. J. Lin. *LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines*. Available at: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
