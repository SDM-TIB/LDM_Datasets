To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Social Affordance Grammar from Videos: Transferring Human Interactions to Human-Robot Interactions" by Tianmin Shu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "new RGB-D video dataset with rich instances of human interactions," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the need for learning social affordances from human interaction videos, but it does not provide specific dataset names. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they collected and compiled a new RGB-D video dataset on top of an existing dataset. They summarize the new dataset in **Table I**, which lists various categories of interactions (e.g., Shake Hands, High Five, Pull Up, Wave Hands, Hand Over) along with the number of instances for each category across different scenarios. This table provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and content.

The authors also reference two existing RGB-D video datasets for human-human interactions, specifically citing them in the context of their work. I will need to identify these datasets and their citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. For the new dataset compiled by the authors, they mention:
   > "We plan to release the dataset." However, no specific citation is provided in the references, indicating that it may be a new contribution that is not yet formally published.

2. For the existing datasets, the paper references:
   > [12] T. Shu, M. S. Ryoo, and S.-C. Zhu, “Learning social affordance for human-robot interaction,” in IJCAI, 2016.
   > [29] K. Yun, J. Honorio, D. Chattopadhyay, T. L. Berg, and D. Samaras, “Two-person interaction detection using body-pose features and multiple instance learning,” in CVPR Workshops, 2012.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

- **New RGB-D Video Dataset**: This dataset includes various categories of human interactions, with a total of 55 instances across different scenarios.
- **Existing RGB-D Video Dataset**: The first existing dataset is referenced as part of the work by Shu et al. (2016), and the second is referenced from Yun et al. (2012).

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, noting that the new dataset may not have a formal citation yet, while the existing datasets do.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited.
