To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Math-Aware Automated Classification and Similarity Search of Scientific Publications" by Michal Růžička and Petr Sojka, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a subset of arXiv.org papers with Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC) codes, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used in their experiments. They mention using the **NTCIR-11 Math-2 dataset**, which consists of 105,120 scientific articles from arXiv.org. They filtered this dataset to select 8,004 articles with exactly one MSC assigned, which they used as their data corpus.

In this section, the authors provide details about the filtering criteria and the characteristics of the selected articles, confirming that this dataset is central to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NTCIR-11 Math-2 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **NTCIR-11 Math-2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Akiko Aizawa et al. “NTCIR-11 Math-2 Task Overview”. In: Proceedings of the 11th NTCIR Conference on Evaluation of Information Access Technologies. Ed. by Hideo Joho and Kazuaki Kishida. Tokyo: NII, Tokyo 101-8430 Japan, 2014-12. isbn: 978-4-86049-065-2. url: http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/workshop/OnlineProceedings11/pdf/NTCIR/OVERVIEW/01-NTCIR11-OV-MATH-AizawaA.pdf.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included as required.
