To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trust in Data Science: Collaboration, Translation, and Accountability in Corporate Data Science Projects" by Samir Passi and Steven J. Jackson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention specific datasets or types of data used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their research site and methods. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used during their ethnographic fieldwork. I will look for any references to specific datasets or data sources that were utilized in their research.

Following that, I will analyze the **case studies** presented in the paper. The authors discuss two projects: churn prediction and special financing. I will carefully read through these sections to identify any datasets mentioned in relation to these projects. For instance, in the churn prediction case, the authors refer to subscription data and action data, which may imply the existence of specific datasets.

I will also check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any references to datasets that may have been used to support their findings or conclusions. The authors might summarize their findings in relation to specific datasets or data types.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This may involve looking into the **references section** of the paper to find the original sources of the datasets, especially if they are well-known datasets in the field of data science.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "the Penn Action Dataset" or "the JHMDB Dataset," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly attributed to its source. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for transparency and reproducibility in research.

By following these steps, I will be able to effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I include all necessary citations for each dataset.
