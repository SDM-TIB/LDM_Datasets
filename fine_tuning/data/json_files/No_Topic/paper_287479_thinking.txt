To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implementation of a cost-benefit analysis of Demand-Responsive Transport with a Multi-Agent Transport Simulation" by Conny Grunicke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may hint at the datasets used, particularly in relation to the traffic simulation software MATSim and the mobility study of Göttingen.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used for the simulations. The authors mention that the traffic model is based on data from a household survey on mobility behavior conducted by the City of Göttingen in 2015/2016. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to mobility behavior that is crucial for the analysis.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced in relation to the simulation outcomes or comparisons made between different scenarios (e.g., baseline vs. DRT scenarios). The authors may also discuss the data sources for the transport network and public transport schedules, which are essential for the MATSim simulations.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the household survey data is referenced as "LK Argus (2016). Haushaltsbefragung zum Mobilitätsverhalten 2015 - Göttingen/Rosdorf/Bovenden." This citation will be important for documenting the dataset accurately.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of public transport data, such as GTFS data, which is used for mapping public transport schedules. If the authors reference any specific GTFS datasets or provide citations for them, I will include those as well.

Once I have identified all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to the conventions used in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are complete and formatted correctly, as this is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.
