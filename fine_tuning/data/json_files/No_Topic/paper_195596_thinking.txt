To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Friendly Line CAPTCHAs" by A. K. B. Karunathilake, B. M. D. Balasuriya, and R. G. Ragel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed Line CAPTCHA technique, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the challenges of existing CAPTCHA methods but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that were used in previous studies related to CAPTCHAs. This section cites various works but does not provide specific datasets.

Moving on to the **implementation section**, I will check if the authors describe any datasets used for testing or training their proposed Line CAPTCHA. They discuss the implementation steps and the characteristics of the proposed CAPTCHAs but do not mention any datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets. The references include various papers and reports, but I need to determine if any of these sources provide datasets relevant to the study.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I conclude that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their research. However, they reference several works that may contain datasets related to CAPTCHAs. I will compile the citations for these references to ensure proper attribution:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset citations in the required format, ensuring that all references are properly attributed.
