To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning Based Parameters Adaption Method for Particle Swarm Optimization" by Yin Shiyuan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on **28 CEC 2013 benchmark functions**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the author describes the experiments conducted. Here, the paper explicitly states that the experiments were performed on the **CEC 2013 test set**, which consists of 28 benchmark functions designed for optimization problems. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CEC 2013 benchmark functions. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CEC 2013 test set**, the citation is:
  > J. Liang, B. Qu, P. Suganthan, A. G. Hernández-Díaz, Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the CEC 2013 special session on real-parameter optimization, Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Technical Report 201212 (34) (2013).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CEC 2013 Benchmark Functions**: This dataset includes 28 test functions that simulate a wide variety of optimization problems, and it is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as required.
