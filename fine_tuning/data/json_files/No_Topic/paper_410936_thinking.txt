To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VINNA for Neonates - Orientation Independence through Latent Augmentations" by Leonie Henschel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the challenges of limited availability of ground truth datasets for neonatal brain MRI segmentation, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of collections of neonatal brain MRIs, indicating that specific datasets will likely be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **Material and Methods** section, particularly **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, I will look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of participants, imaging protocols, and any specific characteristics that distinguish them.

In this section, I identify two key datasets:

1. **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**: This dataset includes T1w and T2w MRIs of newborns, with specific imaging parameters and a total of 578 participants. The authors mention that the dataset is publicly available online.

2. **Melbourne Children’s Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) atlas**: This dataset consists of T2w MRI scans and corresponding manual segmentations of healthy term-born neonates. It includes 10 participants and is also publicly available.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For the **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**:
  > Makropoulos, A., Robinson, E. C., Schuh, A., Wright, R., Fitzgibbon, S., Bozek, J., ... & Edwards, A. D. (2018). The developing human connectome project: A minimal processing pipeline for neonatal cortical surface reconstruction. *NeuroImage*, 173, 88-112. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.01.054.

- For the **Melbourne Children’s Regional Infant Brain (M-CRIB) atlas**:
  > Alexander, B., Loh, W. Y., Matthews, L. G., Murray, A. L., Adamson, C., Beare, R., ... & Spittle, A. J. (2019). Desikan-Killiany-Tourville atlas compatible version of M-CRIB neonatal parcellated whole brain atlas: The M-CRIB 2.0. *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 13, 34. doi:10.3389/fnins.2019.00034.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
