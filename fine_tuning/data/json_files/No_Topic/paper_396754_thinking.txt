To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CharacterChat: Learning towards Conversational AI with Personalized Social Support" by Quan Tu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract introduces the concept of the **MBTI-1024 Bank** and the **MBTI-S2Conv dataset**, which are crucial for understanding the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the creation of the **MBTI-1024 Bank**, which consists of 1024 virtual characters with distinct profiles, and the **MBTI-S2Conv dataset**, which contains 10,240 personalized social support conversations between these characters. This indicates that both datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors explain how the **MBTI-1024 Bank** was developed using persona decomposition based on the MBTI personality types, and how the **MBTI-S2Conv dataset** was generated through role-playing prompts and dynamic memory mechanisms. This section provides insights into the structure and purpose of each dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are created by the authors themselves, I will cite them as follows:

1. **MBTI-1024 Bank**: 
   > Tu, Q., Chen, C., Li, J., Li, Y., Shang, S., Zhao, D., Wang, R., & Yan, R. (2023). *CharacterChat: Learning towards Conversational AI with Personalized Social Support*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. [Publisher].

2. **MBTI-S2Conv Dataset**: 
   > Tu, Q., Chen, C., Li, J., Li, Y., Shang, S., Zhao, D., Wang, R., & Yan, R. (2023). *CharacterChat: Learning towards Conversational AI with Personalized Social Support*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers]. [Publisher].

Since both datasets are part of the same research work, they share the same citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights their key features, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
