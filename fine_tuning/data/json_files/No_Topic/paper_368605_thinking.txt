To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COGEDAP: A Comprehensive Genomic Data Analysis Platform" by Bayram Cevdet Akdeniz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and application sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of the COGEDAP platform for genomic data analysis, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the use of various GWAS tools and the challenges associated with genomic data analysis. This section may provide insights into specific datasets used in conjunction with these tools.

In the **methodology section**, the authors outline the requirements for the platform and the use of software container technologies. They also mention the need for data harmonization across different sites, which implies that there are datasets being analyzed. I will look for any specific datasets referenced in this context.

Moving on to the **application section**, the authors describe a use case involving the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). This is a significant dataset that is likely to be detailed further in the paper. I will extract information about this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the MoBa study, which is crucial for my dataset extraction. I will ensure to include the complete citation for this dataset.

The citation for the MoBa dataset is:
> Magnus P, Birke C, Vejrup K, Haugan A, Alsaker E, Daltveit AK, Handal M, Haugen M, Hoiseth G, Knudsen GP, Paltiel L, Schreuder P; Tambs K, Vold L, Stoltenberg C. *Cohort Profile Update: The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)*. International Journal of Epidemiology, 2016; 45:382-388.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
