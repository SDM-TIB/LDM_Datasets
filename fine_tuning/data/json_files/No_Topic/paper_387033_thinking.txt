To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic quantized consensus under DoS attacks: Towards a tight zooming-out factor" by Shuai Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses dynamic quantized consensus and mentions the context of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **results** or **discussion** section, I will check there as well, as authors often summarize their findings in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying any datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might provide additional information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset identified in the paper.
