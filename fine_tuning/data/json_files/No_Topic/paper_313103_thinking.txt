To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysing Mixed Initiatives and Search Strategies during Conversational Search" by Mohammad Aliannejadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed an analysis using **49 TREC WebTrack Topics**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental method in section 5, where they mention using the **TREC Web Track** topics from 2009 to 2012. They filtered these topics to arrive at **49 topics with a total of 211 facets**. This is a clear indication of the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the TREC Web Track dataset. The TREC Web Track is a well-known dataset in the information retrieval community, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation.

The citation for the TREC Web Track topics is typically as follows:
> TREC. (2009-2012). *TREC Web Track*. Retrieved from https://trec.nist.gov/data/web/

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **TREC Web Track Topics**: This dataset consists of 49 topics with a total of 211 facets, which were used to analyze mixed initiative strategies in conversational search.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the full citation for the dataset, as it is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use of this information.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the dataset information in the required format for further processing or review.
