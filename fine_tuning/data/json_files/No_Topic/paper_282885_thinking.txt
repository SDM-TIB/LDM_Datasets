To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaneRCNN: Distributed Representations for Graph-Centric Motion Forecasting" by Wenyuan Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on the **Argoverse Motion Forecasting Benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find more detailed information about the dataset. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **Argoverse dataset** in detail, mentioning that it consists of over 30,000 real-world driving sequences collected in Miami and Pittsburgh, with specific annotations for actor motions and HD maps. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure, including the number of sequences in the training, validation, and test sets.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Argoverse dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Argoverse Dataset**:
  > Ming-Fang Chang, John Lambert, Patsorn Sangkloy, Jagjeet Singh, Slawomir Bak, Andrew Hartnett, De Wang, Peter Carr, Simon Lucey, Deva Ramanan, et al. *Argoverse: 3D Tracking and Forecasting with Rich Maps*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Argoverse dataset** using the required format, ensuring that I include the full citation as specified.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring that it is structured and ready for any further processing or review.
