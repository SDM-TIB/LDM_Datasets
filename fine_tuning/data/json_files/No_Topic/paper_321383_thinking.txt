To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge Computing and Communication for Energy-Efficient Earth Surveillance with LEO Satellites" by Marc Martinez-Gost et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the optimization of energy consumption and mentions experimental results, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** closely. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to identify any datasets.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, such as a "Datasets" or "Data Collection" section, I will focus on that to gather comprehensive details about each dataset, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the "PAZ satellite mission dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the dataset online or in related literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete for future reference or analysis.
