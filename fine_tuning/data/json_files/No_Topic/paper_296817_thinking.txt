To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boundary controlled irreversible port-Hamiltonian systems" by Hector Ramirez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions and may mention any datasets used for validation or examples. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in a dedicated section, I will scan through the **methods** and **results** sections. Authors often mention datasets when discussing their methodology or when presenting results. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on."

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Scan the methods and results sections for any additional mentions of datasets.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information and citations for clarity and accessibility.
