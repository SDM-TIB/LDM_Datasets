To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A low latency ASR-free end to end spoken language understanding system" by Mohamed Mhiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed system is evaluated on the **Fluent Speech Commands dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors provide a summary of the experiments conducted. In this section, they present a table (Table 2) that details the **Fluent Speech Commands dataset**. The table includes information such as the number of speakers, utterances, and hours of audio, confirming that this dataset is indeed used for evaluation.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **experiments sections**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the Fluent Speech Commands dataset, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Fluent Speech Commands dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Fluent Speech Commands dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Lugosch, M. Ravanelli, P. Ignoto, V. S. Tomar, and Y. Bengio. *Speech model pre-training for end-to-end spoken language understanding*. 2019.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Fluent Speech Commands dataset, ready for further processing or review.
