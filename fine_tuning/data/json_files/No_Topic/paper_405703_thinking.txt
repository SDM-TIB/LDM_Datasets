To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inference for Rank-Rank Regressions" by Denis Chetverikov and Daniel Wilhelm, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical applications sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions two empirical studies on intergenerational mobility, which suggests that datasets may be involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical applications section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their analyses of intergenerational income mobility in Germany and intergenerational education mobility in India. This section is likely to contain explicit references to the datasets used.

1. **Intergenerational Income Mobility in Germany**: The authors mention using data from the **German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP)**, which contains income data on linked child-parent pairs. I will note this dataset and look for its full citation in the references section.

2. **Intergenerational Education Mobility in India**: The authors refer to the **2012 India Human Development Survey (IHDS)** dataset. I will also note this dataset and check for its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP)**, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes the dataset comprehensively.

- For the **India Human Development Survey (IHDS)**, I will similarly find the citation that provides details about this dataset.

Once I have gathered the names and full citations of the datasets, I will ensure that I format them correctly and include any relevant details such as the number of observations or specific variables used in the analysis, if mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that it is ready for further use or analysis.
