To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Video Quality Datasets via Design of Minimalistic Video Quality Models" by Wei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a computational analysis of existing VQA datasets, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **related work** section, specifically **section 2.1 (VQA Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they analyzed. This section is likely to contain the names and characteristics of the datasets used in their study.

In this section, the authors mention eight datasets:

1. **CVD2014**: A dataset containing 234 videos recorded by 78 cameras, with various compression formats and resolutions.
   - Citation: Nuutinen, M., Virtanen, T., Vaahteranoksa, M., Vuori, T., Oittinen, P., & Hakkinen, J. (2016). *CVD2014—A database for evaluating no-reference video quality assessment algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 25(7), 3073-3086.

2. **LIVE-Qualcomm**: Comprising 208 videos using 8 different smartphones under 54 unique scenes.
   - Citation: Ghadiyaram, D., Pan, J., Bovik, A. C., Moorthy, A. K., Panda, P., & Yang, K.-C. (2017). *In-capture mobile video distortions: A study of subjective behavior and objective algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 28(9), 2061-2077.

3. **KoNViD-1k**: A dataset of 1,200 videos sampled from YFCC100M.
   - Citation: Hosu, V., Hahn, F., Jenadeleh, M., Lin, H., Men, H., Sziranyi, T., Li, S., & Saupe, D. (2017). *The Konstanz natural video database (KoNViD-1k)*. In IEEE International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (pp. 1-6).

4. **LIVE-VQC**: Consists of 585 in-captured videos by 80 mobile cameras.
   - Citation: Sinno, Z., & Bovik, A. C. (2018). *Large-scale study of perceptual video quality*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(2), 612-627.

5. **YouTube-UGC**: A dataset of 1,500 videos selected from YouTube.
   - Citation: Wang, Y., Inguva, S., & Adsumilli, B. (2019). *Youtube UGC dataset for video compression research*. In IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (pp. 1-5).

6. **LBVD**: Gathers 1,013 live broadcasting videos based on HTTP adaptive streaming.
   - Citation: Chen, P., Li, L., Huang, Y., Tan, F., & Chen, W. (2019). *QoE evaluation for live broadcasting video*. In IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (pp. 454-458).

7. **LSVQ**: A large dataset with 38,811 videos sampled from the Internet Archive and YFCC100M.
   - Citation: Ying, Z., Mandal, M., Ghadiyaram, D., & Bovik, A. C. (2021). *Patch-VQ: ‘Patching Up’ the video quality problem*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 14 019-14 029).

8. **LIVE-YT-Gaming**: A dataset targeting streamed gaming videos with 600 gaming videos.
   - Citation: Yu, X., Tu, Z., Ying, Z., Bovik, A. C., Birkbeck, N., Wang, Y., & Adsumilli, B. (2022). *Subjective quality assessment of user-generated content gaming videos*. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (pp. 74-83).

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
