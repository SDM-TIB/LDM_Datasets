To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Permutationless many-jet event reconstruction with symmetry preserving attention networks" by Michael James Fenton et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel approach to reconstructing events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which suggests that datasets related to particle physics and jet events may be discussed. 

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe a sample of 50 million simulated events generated for top quark pair production. They specify that the events were generated using MADGRAPH_AMC@NLO and simulated with DELPHES, which indicates the datasets are based on simulated particle collision events.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Simulated pp → t¯t events
- **Description**: A sample of 50 million events generated at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, with specific requirements for jet reconstruction.
- **Details**: The dataset includes 5,926,407 events that meet preselection criteria of having at least 6 jets and 2 b-jets.

I will also note that the authors mention the availability of the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. They provide a link to the code release where the dataset can be accessed.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the tools and methods used to generate the dataset. The relevant citations include:
- For **MADGRAPH**:
  > J. Alwall, R. Frederix, S. Frixione, V. Hirschi, F. Maltoni, O. Mattelaer, H. S. Shao, T. Stelzer, P. Torrielli, and M. Zaro. *The automated computation of tree-level and next-to-leading order differential cross sections, and their matching to parton shower simulations*. J. High Energy Phys. 07 (2014) 079.
  
- For **DELPHES**:
  > J. de Favereau, C. Delaere, P. Demin, A. Giammanco, V. Lematre, A. Mertens, and M. Selvaggi (DELPHES 3 Collaboration). *DELPHES 3, A modular framework for fast simulation of a generic collider experiment*. J. High Energy Phys. 02 (2014) 057.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citations for both the simulation and the framework used.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and proper attribution.
