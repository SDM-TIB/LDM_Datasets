To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust and Fast Decoding of High-Capacity Color QR Codes for Mobile Applications" by Zhibo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a large-scale color QR code dataset, CUHK-CQRC, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the creation of the CUHK-CQRC dataset for benchmarking color QR code decoding algorithms. This section provides context for the dataset's purpose and significance.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the CUHK-CQRC dataset. The authors state that it consists of 5390 high-density color QR code samples captured under various lighting conditions. This confirms the dataset's size and the conditions under which it was collected.

I will also check the **results and evaluation sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the CUHK-CQRC dataset is referenced in the context of specific experiments or comparisons with other methods.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the CUHK-CQRC dataset. The authors mention that this dataset is publicly available, which is important for proper citation.

The full citation for the CUHK-CQRC dataset is:
> Zhibo Yang, Huanle Xu, Jianyuan Deng, Chen Change Loy, and Wing Cheong Lau. *CUHK-CQRC: A Large-Scale Color QR Code Dataset for Benchmarking Color QR Code Decoding Algorithms*. Available at http://www.authpaper.net/colorDatabase/index.html.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset, its purpose, and the citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have thoroughly reviewed the relevant sections of the paper, identified the dataset, and retrieved the full citation to maintain academic integrity and provide proper credit.
