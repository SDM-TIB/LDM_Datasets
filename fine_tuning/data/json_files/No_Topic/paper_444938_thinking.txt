To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REGMIX: Data Mixture as Regression for Language Model Pre-training" by Qian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract mentions the use of various datasets for training and evaluation, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluating on regression prediction)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used in their experiments. They specifically mention the **Pile dataset** and its components, which are crucial for understanding the data mixture they are working with.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide an overview of the Pile dataset, listing various components along with their effective sizes. The components include:

1. **Pile-CC**: A large dataset derived from CommonCrawl, which is significant for language model training.
2. **PubMed Central**: A dataset containing biomedical literature.
3. **Books3**: A collection of books for diverse textual data.
4. **OpenWebText2**: A dataset created from web pages.
5. **ArXiv**: A repository of research papers.
6. **GitHub**: A dataset containing code repositories.
7. **FreeLaw**: A dataset of legal documents.
8. **Stack Exchange**: A dataset from the Q&A platform.
9. **USPTO Backgrounds**: A dataset of patent documents.
10. **PubMed Abstracts**: A collection of abstracts from biomedical papers.
11. **Gutenberg (PG-19)**: A dataset of literary works from Project Gutenberg.
12. **OpenSubtitles**: A dataset of movie subtitles.
13. **Wikipedia (en)**: The English version of Wikipedia.
14. **DM Mathematics**: A dataset focused on mathematics-related content.
15. **Ubuntu IRC**: A dataset from the Ubuntu community chat logs.
16. **EuroParl**: A dataset of European Parliament proceedings.
17. **HackerNews**: A dataset from the Hacker News website.
18. **YoutubeSubtitles**: A dataset of subtitles from YouTube videos.
19. **PhilPapers**: A dataset of philosophical papers.
20. **NIH ExPorter**: A dataset related to NIH research.
21. **Enron Emails**: A dataset of emails from the Enron corporation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Pile dataset is cited as follows:

- For the **Pile dataset**:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., et al. (2021). *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. CoRR, abs/2101.00027. URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027.

For the other datasets, I will need to look for their respective citations, which may be found in the references or inferred from the context in which they are mentioned.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
