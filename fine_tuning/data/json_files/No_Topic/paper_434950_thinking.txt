To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Braced Fourier Continuation and Regression for Anomaly Detection" by Josef Sabuda, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets and experiments**. The abstract mentions the introduction of a novel algorithm and references "example data sets" available via GitHub, which suggests that datasets are included in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **subsequent sections**. In the introduction, the author discusses the BFCR algorithm but does not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **anomaly detection sections** to see if any datasets are referenced.

In **section 4 (Anomaly Detection with BFCR)**, the author discusses using BFCR for anomaly detection but does not name specific datasets. However, there are references to example data taken from other sources, which may indicate datasets used for demonstration purposes.

I will check the **figures and their captions** for any references to datasets. For instance, Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the BFCR algorithm's application on example data taken from [4] and [6]. This indicates that datasets from these references are used in the analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the dataset referenced in **Figure 5**, which is taken from:
   > NIC. Financial Data Download. URL: https://www.ffiec.gov/npw/FinancialReport/FinancialDataDownload.

2. For the dataset referenced in **Figure 6**, which is taken from:
   > Matt Wyrick. SOMA-Asset-Forecasting. 2022. URL: https://github.com/mattrwyrick/SOMA-Asset-Forecasting.

Since the paper does not provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, I will note that the datasets are available via the provided URLs.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further exploration of the datasets by others interested in the research.
