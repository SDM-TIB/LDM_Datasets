To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Video Game to Real Robot: The Transfer Between Action Spaces" by Janne Karttunen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments and mentions the use of video games for training, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these environments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **ViZDoom platform**, which is based on the Doom (1993) video game, as the source environment for their experiments. This indicates that the game itself serves as a dataset for training the reinforcement learning agent.

In **section 3.1.1 (Source environment)**, the authors specify that the action space consists of four actions: move forward, move backward, turn left, and turn right. While this does not constitute a traditional dataset, it is essential to note that the ViZDoom platform provides the simulation data used for training.

In **section 3.1.2 (Target environment)**, they mention transferring the agent to a Turtlebot 3 Waffle robot, which indicates that the experiments also involve real-world data collected from this robot. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the Turtlebot experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the ViZDoom platform, which is crucial for understanding the source of the training data. The relevant citation for ViZDoom is:

- For **ViZDoom**:
  > Michał Kempka, Marek Wydmuch, Grzegorz Runc, Jakub Toczek, and Wojciech Jaśkowski. *Vizdoom: A Doom-based AI research platform for visual reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence and Games (CIG), 2016, pp. 1–8.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention a dataset name for the Turtlebot experiments, I will note that the data collected from the Turtlebot is part of the experimental results but lacks a formal citation.

In summary, I will compile the relevant dataset information as follows:

1. **ViZDoom Platform**: Used as the source environment for training the agent.
   - Citation: Michał Kempka et al. (2016).

I will ensure that this information is structured clearly for any downstream processing or review.
