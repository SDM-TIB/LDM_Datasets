To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ABC-CDE: Towards Approximate Bayesian Computation with Complex High-Dimensional Data and Limited Simulations" by Rafael Izbicki, Ann B. Lee, and Taylor Pospisil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and hints at the use of simulated data, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or simulations used in their research. If they reference any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments. The authors may describe how they generated data or the specific datasets they utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any detailed descriptions of datasets used in the experiments. This section often provides insights into the datasets' characteristics, such as size, type, and how they were used in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If they refer to a simulation method, I will note that as well, but I will focus on datasets that are explicitly named.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, making sure to highlight the importance of proper citation for each dataset used in the research.
