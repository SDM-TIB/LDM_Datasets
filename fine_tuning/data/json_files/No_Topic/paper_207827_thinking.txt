To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Document Summarisation via Classification" by Umanga Bista et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on a newly curated collection of controversial news topics, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets on Controversial News Topics)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets they used. Here, they describe the process of curating news articles on three controversial topics over a 14-month period. The topics mentioned are:

1. **Beef Ban**: This dataset consists of 1,543 articles related to the controversy over the slaughter and sale of beef on religious grounds.
2. **Capital Punishment**: This dataset includes 7,905 articles discussing the use of the death penalty.
3. **Gun Control**: This dataset contains 6,494 articles focused on restrictions related to firearms.

The authors also provide statistics on the number of tweets and news articles collected for each topic, which further confirms the existence of these datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers or sources that describe the datasets or the methodology used to collect them. The paper cites the following relevant works:

- For the **Beef Ban** topic, the authors reference their own methodology for curating the dataset, which is based on Twitter data collection.
- The **Capital Punishment** and **Gun Control** datasets are similarly curated using Twitter posts, as described in the methodology section.

The citations for the datasets are not explicitly provided in the references, but the authors mention that the datasets and code are available on their GitHub repository. Therefore, I will note that the datasets can be accessed through the following link:

> GitHub Repository: https://github.com/computationalmedia/compsumm

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the link to the repository for full access.

In summary, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for future reference.
