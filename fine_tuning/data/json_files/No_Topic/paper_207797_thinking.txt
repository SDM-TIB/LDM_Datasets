To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segmentation-driven 6D Object Pose Estimation" by Yinlin Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors outperform state-of-the-art methods on the **Occluded-LINEMOD** and **YCB-Video** datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **Occluded-LINEMOD** and **YCB-Video** datasets. They provide details about the Occluded-LINEMOD dataset, noting that it contains 1214 images with pose annotations for 8 different objects. They also mention that the YCB-Video dataset consists of 21 objects with diverse sizes and textures, containing about 130K real images and additional synthetic images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Occluded-LINEMOD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alexander Krull, Eric Brachmann, Frank Michel, Michael Ying Yang, Stefan Gumhold, and Carsten Rother. *Learning Analysis-By-Synthesis for 6D Pose Estimation in RGB-D Images*. In International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015.

- For the **YCB-Video dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu Xiang, Tanner Schmidt, Venkatraman Narayanan, and Dieter Fox. *PoseCNN: A Convolutional Neural Network for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes*. In Robotics: Science and Systems, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **Occluded-LINEMOD Dataset**: Contains 1214 images with pose annotations for 8 different objects, designed to evaluate object pose estimation methods in the presence of occlusions.

2. **YCB-Video Dataset**: Comprises 21 objects with diverse sizes and textures, containing approximately 130K real images and additional synthetic images, used for evaluating 6D object pose estimation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
