To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design of Conformal Antenna for Aircraft Applications" by N.V. Laxminarayen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the design and analysis of the conformal antenna**. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and subsequent sections for any references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of antennas in wireless communication but do not mention any specific datasets. I will then examine the **design and analysis sections** to see if any experimental data or datasets are referenced.

Upon reviewing the **design section**, I notice that the authors describe the design process and parameters for the conformal antenna, including calculations for width, effective dielectric constant, and feeding techniques. However, there are no explicit datasets mentioned here either.

Next, I will check the **analysis section**, where the authors present results such as S-parameters, gain, and directivity. They provide simulated results but do not reference any external datasets or benchmarks used for comparison.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the literature. The references include various papers on antenna design and performance, but they do not specifically mention datasets that were used in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets provided or referenced in this research. The authors focus on the design and simulation results of their conformal antenna without utilizing external datasets for validation or comparison.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting the absence of datasets in the research paper.
