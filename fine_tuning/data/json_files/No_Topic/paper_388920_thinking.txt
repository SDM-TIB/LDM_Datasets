To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exact Count of Boundary Pieces of ReLU Classifiers: Towards the Proper Complexity Measure for Classification" by Paweł Piwek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses numerical experiments conducted on synthetic data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two synthetic datasets: 

1. **2D Gaussian Mixture Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3x3 mixing components, each being an isotropic Gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.1. The means are grid points from {−1, 0, 1} × {−1, 0, 1}.

2. **2D Spiral Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a two-dimensional distribution that creates a spiral shape, which is more complex than the Gaussian mixture.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and generated by the authors, they may not have formal citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note the descriptions provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

- For the **2D Gaussian Mixture Dataset**, I will note the details as follows:
  - Description: A dataset consisting of 3x3 mixing components, each being an isotropic Gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.1. The means are grid points from {−1, 0, 1} × {−1, 0, 1}.

- For the **2D Spiral Dataset**, I will note the details as follows:
  - Description: A dataset generated from a two-dimensional distribution that creates a spiral shape, with specific parameters outlined in the paper.

Since these datasets are synthetic and created for the purpose of the experiments, they do not have formal citations. I will document them as described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that I clearly present the dataset descriptions and any relevant details for future reference or analysis.
