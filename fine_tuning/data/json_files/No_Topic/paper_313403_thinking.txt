To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FFAVOD: Feature Fusion Architecture for Video Object Detection" by Hughes Perreault et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their method on two traffic surveillance datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.2) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they identify two datasets:

1. **UA-DETRAC**: This dataset is recorded with a fixed camera and is used for multi-object detection and tracking in traffic surveillance scenarios. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.

2. **UAVDT**: This dataset is recorded with a mobile camera and is also used for object detection and tracking in traffic scenarios. The authors again provide a citation for this dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **UA-DETRAC**, the citation is:
  > Wen, L., Du, D., Cai, Z., Lei, Z., Chang, M.C., Qi, H., Lim, J., Yang, M.H., Lyu, S. (2015). UA-DETRAC: A New Benchmark and Protocol for Multi-Object Detection and Tracking. arXiv CoRR abs/1511.04136.

- For **UAVDT**, the citation is:
  > Du, D., Qi, Y., Yu, H., Yang, Y., Duan, K., Li, G., Zhang, W., Huang, Q., Tian, Q. (2018). The unmanned aerial vehicle benchmark: Object detection and tracking. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 370â€“386.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as specified.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper, facilitating further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
