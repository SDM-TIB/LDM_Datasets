To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lynx: An Open Source Hallucination Evaluation Model" by Selvan Sunitha Ravi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of **HaluBench**, a hallucination evaluation benchmark consisting of 15k samples, which indicates that this is a dataset I need to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference several existing Question Answer (QA) datasets used to train their model, including **CovidQA, PubmedQA, DROP, and FinanceBench**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of how they constructed **HaluBench** and the datasets they sourced examples from. They mention:

1. **FinanceBench**: A dataset with 10k questions, contexts, and answers over financial documents.
2. **DROP**: An English reading comprehension benchmark assessing reasoning ability over paragraphs.
3. **CovidQA**: A dataset consisting of question-answer pairs related to COVID-19.
4. **PubMedQA**: A biomedical QA dataset collected from PubMed abstracts.
5. **HaluEval**: A dataset consisting of general user queries with ChatGPT responses.
6. **RAGTruth**: A corpus containing word-level hallucination annotations on LLM-generated text.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about their application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
