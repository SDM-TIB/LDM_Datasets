To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARCS: Accurate Rotation and Correspondence Search" by Liangzu Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will find mentions of datasets such as:

1. **3DMatch Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of the proposed methods. It contains over 1000 point clouds representing various scenes, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in the experiments.

2. **Synthetic Point Clouds**: The authors also mention generating synthetic datasets for testing their algorithms. While this may not be a traditional dataset with a citation, it is important to note that the authors created these datasets under specific conditions (e.g., noise levels, inlier ratios).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. For the **3DMatch Dataset**, the citation is:
> Andy Zeng, Shuran Song, Matthias Nie√üner, Matthew Fisher, Jianxiong Xiao, and T Funkhouser. *3DMatch: Learning the matching of local 3D geometry in range scans*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, page 4, 2017.

For the synthetic datasets, since they are generated by the authors, I will note that they do not have a formal citation but are described in the methodology.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
