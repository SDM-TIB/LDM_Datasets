To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing Finite Sums with the Stochastic Average Gradient" by Mark Schmidt, Nicolas Le Roux, and Francis Bach, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there is a section that lists the datasets used for evaluation, specifically in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a table (Table 2) that lists various datasets along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Quantum Dataset**: Contains 78 data points and 50,000 variables.
2. **Protein Dataset**: Contains 74 data points and 145,751 variables.
3. **Covertype Dataset**: Contains 54 data points and 581,012 variables.
4. **RCV1 Dataset**: Contains 47,236 data points and 20,242 variables.
5. **News Dataset**: Contains 1,355,191 data points and 19,996 variables.
6. **Spam Dataset**: Contains 823,470 data points and 92,189 variables.
7. **RCV1Full Dataset**: Contains 47,236 data points and 697,641 variables.
8. **Sido Dataset**: Contains 4,932 data points and 12,678 variables.
9. **Alpha Dataset**: Contains 500,000 data points and 500 variables.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the sources for the datasets, which are crucial for proper attribution. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
