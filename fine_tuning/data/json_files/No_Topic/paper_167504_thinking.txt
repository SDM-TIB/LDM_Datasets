To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Options and Covariance Testing for Long Horizon Off-Policy Policy Evaluation" by Zhaohan Daniel Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets that are utilized in the experiments, particularly in sections that detail the experimental setup or results.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a specific dataset called **NoisyTaxi**, which is a partially observable variant of the popular Taxi domain. This dataset is crucial for their simulations and experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NoisyTaxi dataset. However, since NoisyTaxi is a variant of an existing domain, I will also look for the original source of the Taxi domain to provide a complete citation.

The original Taxi domain is referenced as follows:
> Dietterich, T. G. (2000). Hierarchical reinforcement learning with the maxq value function decomposition. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 13, 227-303.

Since NoisyTaxi is based on the original Taxi domain, I will cite both the original source and mention that NoisyTaxi is a modified version used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for documentation.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Identify the NoisyTaxi dataset and its significance in the experiments.
4. Retrieve the full citation for the original Taxi domain from the references.
5. Document the dataset information clearly, including citations.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
