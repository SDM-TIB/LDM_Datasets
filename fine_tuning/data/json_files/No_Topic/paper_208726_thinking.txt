To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation with Enhanced Decoder Input" by Junliang Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three widely used public machine translation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **IWSLT14 De-En**: This dataset consists of 153K bilingual sentence pairs used for training. The authors specify that they use a 7K data split from the training set as the validation set and concatenate several test sets for evaluation.

2. **WMT14 En-De**: This dataset contains 4.5 million bilingual sentence pairs in the training set. The authors indicate that they use newstest2013 and newstest2014 as the validation and test sets, respectively.

3. **WMT16 En-Ro**: This dataset has 2.9 million bilingual sentence pairs in the training set. The validation set is newsdev2016, and the test set is newstest2016.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **IWSLT14**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2014). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT).

- For **WMT14**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

- For **WMT16**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2016). *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
