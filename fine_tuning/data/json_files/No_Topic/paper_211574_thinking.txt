To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STFNets: Learning Sensing Signals from the Time-Frequency Perspective with Short-Time Fourier Neural Networks" by Shuochao Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the evaluation section typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for effective feature extraction from IoT sensing signals, which suggests that they will likely use specific datasets to validate their approach. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that may include datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they detail the datasets used for various sensing modalities, including:

1. **Motion Sensor Dataset**: This dataset is collected by Allan et al. and includes readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes from 9 volunteers performing 6 activities. Each data sample is a 512 × 6 matrix.

2. **WiFi Dataset**: This dataset involves Channel State Information (CSI) collected from 11 volunteers across different rooms, capturing 6 activities. Each data sample is a 512 × 30 matrix.

3. **Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of data collected from 12 volunteers performing 6 activities using an ultrasound signal. Each sample is a 512 × 1 matrix.

4. **Visible Light Dataset**: This dataset captures human activities using photoreceptors under different lighting conditions, involving 6 volunteers performing 4 gestures. Each sample is a 128 × 6 matrix.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the Motion Sensor dataset is:

- Allan Stisen, Henrik Blunck, Sourav Bhattacharya, Thor Siiger Prentow, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard, Anind Dey, Tobias Sonne, and Mads Møller Jensen. *Smart devices are different: Assessing and mitigating mobile sensing heterogeneities for activity recognition*. In Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, pages 127–140, 2015.

For the WiFi dataset, the citation is:

- Daniel Halperin, Wenjun Hu, Anmol Sheth, and David Wetherall. *Tool release: Gathering 802.11n traces with channel state information*. ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, 41(1):53–53, 2011.

The citation for the Ultrasound dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, so I will note that it may require further investigation or may be part of the authors' own collection.

The citation for the Visible Light dataset is also not explicitly mentioned, so I will similarly note that it may require further investigation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
