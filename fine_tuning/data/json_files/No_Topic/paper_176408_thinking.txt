To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Diffusion on Region Manifolds: Recovering Small Objects with Compact CNN Representations" by Ahmet Iscen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction also mentions applications that benefit from image retrieval, hinting at the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using three datasets in the **Experiments section**:

1. **Oxford Buildings Dataset**: This is a well-known benchmark for image retrieval, consisting of images of various buildings in Oxford.
2. **Paris Dataset**: Another standard benchmark for image retrieval, containing images of various locations in Paris.
3. **INSTRE Dataset**: A newer dataset introduced for instance-level object retrieval, containing images of everyday objects with various variations.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Oxford Buildings Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philbin, J., Chum, O., Isard, M., Sivic, J., & Zisserman, A. (2007). Object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

- For the **Paris Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philbin, J., Chum, O., Isard, M., Sivic, J., & Zisserman, A. (2008). Lost in quantization: Improving particular object retrieval in large scale image databases. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

- For the **INSTRE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, S., & Jiang, S. (2015). INSTRE: A new benchmark for instance-level object retrieval and recognition. *ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications*, 11(3), 37.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
