To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HeadGAN: One-shot Neural Head Synthesis and Editing" by Michail Christos Doukas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various tasks, which may hint at the datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often outline the context of their research and may reference specific datasets. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have used in their experiments.

Moving on to the **methodology** section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss data preprocessing or dataset descriptions. The authors may detail how they utilized specific datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors typically describe their experimental setup, including the datasets they used, which is essential for my extraction process.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical, as providing complete citations is a key requirement.

From the paper, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **VoxCeleb Dataset**: The authors mention that they trained and evaluated HeadGAN on the VoxCeleb dataset, which contains over 100,000 videos of 1,251 identities.

The full citation for the VoxCeleb dataset is:
> J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In INTERSPEECH, 2017.

Now that I have extracted the relevant dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
