To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Monolithic Silicon-Photonics Linear-Algebra Accelerators Enabling Next-Gen Massive MIMO" by Tzu-Chien Hsueh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to gather the full citations for each dataset. This information is usually found in the **references section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, as these citations are crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions the "Penn Action Dataset" and "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will locate their respective citations in the references. The citations should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

After compiling the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's details, including any relevant characteristics or usage notes mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
