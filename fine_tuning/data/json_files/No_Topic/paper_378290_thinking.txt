To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assorted, Archetypal and Annotated Two Million (3A2M) Cooking Recipes Dataset based on Active Learning" by Nazmus Sakib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel dataset of two million culinary recipes categorized into nine genres, which indicates that a primary dataset is being discussed.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. Here, the authors explain the motivation behind creating the dataset and mention that it is built on top of the **RecipeNLG dataset**. This suggests that the RecipeNLG dataset is also relevant and should be included.

In **section 3 (RecipeNLG Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the RecipeNLG dataset, stating that it contains 2,231,142 culinary recipes. This section confirms that this dataset is foundational to their work and should be cited.

Then, I will look at **section 4 (3A2M Dataset Construction)**, where the authors describe the construction of the 3A2M dataset. They mention that they categorized 300,000 recipes into nine genres with the help of human annotators and used active learning to label the remaining recipes. This section provides specific details about the dataset's attributes and the methodology used for its creation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **3A2M Cooking Recipes Dataset**: This dataset is the primary focus of the paper, containing over two million culinary recipes categorized into nine genres. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Sakib, N., Shahariar, G. M., Kabir, M. M., Hasan, M. K., & Mahmud, H. (2023). Assorted, Archetypal and Annotated Two Million (3A2M) Cooking Recipes Dataset based on Active Learning. *[Journal Name]*, *[Volume]*, *[Pages]*. [Link to dataset if available].

2. **RecipeNLG Dataset**: This dataset serves as the basis for the 3A2M dataset. The citation for the RecipeNLG dataset is:
   > Bień, M., Gilski, M., Maciejewska, M., Taisner, W., Wisniewski, D., & A., L. (2020). RecipeNLG: A cooking recipes dataset for semi-structured text generation. In *Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Natural Language Generation* (pp. 22–28). 

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset, including their purposes and methodologies, before compiling them into a structured format for further use or analysis.
