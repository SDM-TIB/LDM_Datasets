To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Follow the Money: Exploring the Key Factors Influencing Investment in African Startups" by Khalil Liouane, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study analyzes **2,521 startup investment deals**, which suggests that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **data and methods section**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. The paper states that the dataset is sourced from **africathebigdeal.com** and includes **2,521 startup deals** with **34 attributes**. This is a clear identification of the primary dataset used in the analysis.

I will also look for any secondary datasets mentioned. The paper references **1,792 investors** who engaged in at least one investment in African startups, which could be considered a secondary dataset. However, the focus remains on the primary dataset of startup deals.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the primary dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from a website, I will note that down as follows:

- For the dataset from **africathebigdeal.com**, the citation is:
  > Liouane, K. (2023). *Follow the Money: Exploring the Key Factors Influencing Investment in African Startups*. Carnegie Mellon University. Retrieved from https://africathebigdeal.com

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset in the traditional sense (like a journal article), I will format it according to the context provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
