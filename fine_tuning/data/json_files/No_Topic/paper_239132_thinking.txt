To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TraLFM: Latent Factor Modeling of Traffic Trajectory Data" by Meng Chen, Xiaohui Yu, and Yang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical studies on **two real datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they specifically mention:

1. **Taxi Trajectory Data**: This dataset consists of the complete trips of 442 taxis operating in the city of Porto, Portugal, over a complete year (from July 1, 2013, to June 30, 2014). The data is processed to form trajectories based on GPS locations.

2. **VPR Data**: This dataset is derived from a traffic surveillance system in Jinan, China, and includes vehicle passage records generated by over 35,000 vehicles. The records contain vehicle IDs, location IDs (from surveillance cameras), and timestamps.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Taxi Trajectory Data**, the citation is:
  > "Taxi data is composed of all the complete trips of 442 taxis running in the city of Porto (Portugal) of 389 sq.km for a complete year (from 01/07/2013 to 30/06/2014)."

- For the **VPR Data**, the citation is:
  > "VPR data is collected from the traffic surveillance system in a major metropolitan area (Jinan, China) with an area of 2,119 sq.km."

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
