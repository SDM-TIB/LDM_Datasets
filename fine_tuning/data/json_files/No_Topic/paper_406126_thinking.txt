To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detrimental Contexts in Open-Domain Question Answering" by Philhoon Oh and James Thorne, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two popular QA datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets in the **experiments section**:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of their proposed methods. It is described as a benchmark for question answering research.

2. **TriviaQA (TQA)**: Similar to NQ, this dataset is also used for evaluation in the experiments. It is noted for its large-scale challenge in reading comprehension.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Natural Questions**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova, Llion Jones, Matthew Kelcey, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew M. Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:452–466, 2019.

- For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:
  > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
