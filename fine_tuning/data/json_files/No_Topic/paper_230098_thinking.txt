To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Parameterized Quantile Function for Distributional Reinforcement Learning" by Derek Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed algorithm was tested on **55 Atari Games**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically the Atari Learning Environment (ALE). This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors state that they conducted experiments on the **Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

In the **references section**, I will search for the full citation of the Atari Learning Environment. The relevant citation is:

- **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**:
  > Marc G Bellemare, Yavar Naddaf, Joel Veness, and Michael Bowling. *The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors primarily focus on the Atari games, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari Learning Environment as it is crucial for proper referencing.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examining the experiments section for detailed dataset usage.
3. Looking up the full citation in the references section.

The final dataset entry will include the Atari Learning Environment with its citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured.
