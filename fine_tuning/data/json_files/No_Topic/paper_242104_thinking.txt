To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Adaptation Improves Accuracy of Deep Learning Model for Automated X-Ray Thoracic Disease Detection: A Thai Study" by Isarun Chamveha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes **421,859 local chest radiographs**, which suggests a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **421,859 frontal chest X-ray images** collected from Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, along with corresponding radiologist reports. This dataset is referred to as the **Thai CXR dataset**.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the same section, the authors refer to a **Reference dataset** that includes **705,184 CXR images** gathered from medical centers worldwide, excluding Thailand. This dataset is used for comparison with the locally adapted model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the Thai CXR dataset is proprietary and specific to this study, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. The Reference dataset, on the other hand, is likely derived from multiple sources, and I will need to note that it is a compilation rather than a single dataset.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Thai CXR dataset**, since it is proprietary, I will note it as:
  > Chamveha, I., Tongdee, T., Saiviroonporn, P., & Chaisangmongkon, W. (2020). Local Adaptation Improves Accuracy of Deep Learning Model for Automated X-Ray Thoracic Disease Detection: A Thai Study. Preprint.

- For the **Reference dataset**, I will note it as:
  > This dataset is a compilation of CXR images from various medical centers worldwide, but specific citations for the individual datasets are not provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their citations.
