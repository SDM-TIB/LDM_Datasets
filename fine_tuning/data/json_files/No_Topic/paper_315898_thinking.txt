To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coarsening Optimization for Differentiable Programming" by Xipeng Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will need to look deeper into the main body of the text for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for evaluation, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors mention several applications and benchmarks, but I need to ensure that I identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. If the datasets are not named directly, I will look for descriptions of the data used in experiments or evaluations.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who wishes to access the datasets or understand their origins. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset like "BGDHyperOpt" mentioned in the experiments, I will document it as follows:

1. **BGDHyperOpt**: A dataset used for optimizing learning rates in batch gradient descent. It consists of various configurations with different input sizes.

Next, I will look for the citation for "BGDHyperOpt" in the references. If it is not a standalone dataset but rather part of a larger study, I will cite the original paper that introduced it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation.
