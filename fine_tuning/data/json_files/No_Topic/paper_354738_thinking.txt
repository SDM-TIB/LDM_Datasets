To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Learning with Graphs" by Yasha Ektefaie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of multimodal datasets and mentions that diverse datasets are combined using graphs, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** to look for explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. I will pay close attention to any sections that describe the data used for training or evaluation, as these are likely to contain the names of the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide details about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits used for training and testing. I will note down any datasets mentioned here.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Cora Dataset" or "ImageNet," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is well-known, I may also verify the citation from external sources to ensure accuracy.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
