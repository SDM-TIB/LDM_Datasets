To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Consistency of Partly Smooth Regularizers" by Samuel Vaiter, Gabriel Peyr√©, and Jalal Fadili, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on least-square regression with partly smooth convex regularizers, but it does not mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. If the paper includes a section specifically discussing datasets, I will carefully note the names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

If no specific section is dedicated to datasets, I will search for mentions of datasets throughout the paper, particularly in the **results or experiments sections**. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to identify any datasets utilized in the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset online to provide a proper citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for any further processing or review, maintaining clarity and accuracy throughout the extraction process.
