To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Deep Learning on Distributed Infrastructures: Challenges, Techniques and Tools" by Ruben Mayer and Hans-Arno Jacobsen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges and techniques for scalable deep learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the challenges and applications of deep learning without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss experiments or evaluations**, particularly looking for sections that might detail any datasets used in the research. In this paper, there are no specific sections dedicated to datasets, as it is more of a survey paper rather than an experimental one.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing frameworks, techniques, and challenges in deep learning, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses various aspects of scalable deep learning, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile for this paper.
