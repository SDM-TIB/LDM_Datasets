To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Continuous Co-Clustering" by Xiao He and Luis Moreira-Matias, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.1.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets, such as the number of samples, features, and clusters.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: Generated using the `make_biclusters` function from the SciKit-Learn package, which creates matrices with implanted co-clusters and varying noise levels.

2. **Text Mining Datasets**:
   - **Classic3**: Composed of abstracts from three domains.
   - **20news2** and **20news10**: Subsets of the 20-Newsgroup dataset.
   - **Reuters**: A dataset used for text classification.
   - **RCV1**: A dataset for news categorization.

3. **Biomedicine Datasets**:
   - **ALLAML**: A gene expression dataset.
   - **Carcinom**: Another gene expression dataset.
   - **GLIOMA**: A dataset related to glioma classification.
   - **Lung**: A dataset for lung cancer classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, the citation for the **20-Newsgroup dataset** is:
> Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), pages 331-339.

Similarly, I will look for citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I capture the full bibliographic details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and properly attributed.
