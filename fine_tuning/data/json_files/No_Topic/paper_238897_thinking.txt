To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ground Truth Evaluation of Neural Network Explanations with CLEVR-XAI" by Leila Arras et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new evaluation framework based on the CLEVR visual question answering task, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Ground Truth Evaluation of Heatmaps)**, where the authors describe their new benchmark dataset, **CLEVR-XAI**. They mention that this dataset is composed of two subsets: **CLEVR-XAI-simple** and **CLEVR-XAI-complex**. I will extract the details of these datasets:

1. **CLEVR-XAI-simple**: This subset contains 39,761 simple questions about object attributes, with ground truth masks for evaluation. The dataset is designed to provide a controlled environment for evaluating explanations.

2. **CLEVR-XAI-complex**: This subset consists of 100,000 complex questions that include spatial relationships and comparisons between objects. It also has corresponding ground truth masks for evaluation.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide additional details about the dataset statistics, including the number of questions and the complexity of the ground truth masks. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CLEVR dataset, which serves as the basis for the CLEVR-XAI dataset, is cited as follows:

- For the original **CLEVR dataset**:
  > Johnson, J., Hariharan, B., van der Maaten, L., Fei-Fei, L., Zitnick, C. L., & Girshick, R. (2017). CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning. In Proceedings of the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1988â€“1997.

Since the CLEVR-XAI dataset is built upon the CLEVR dataset, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **CLEVR-XAI dataset**:
  > Arras, L., Osman, A., & Samek, W. (2021). Ground Truth Evaluation of Neural Network Explanations with CLEVR-XAI. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.00001.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
