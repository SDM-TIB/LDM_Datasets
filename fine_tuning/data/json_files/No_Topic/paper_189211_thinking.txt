To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Automatic Segmentation Method for Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography Volume Data Using Boundary Surface Enhancement" by Yankui Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors performed automatic segmentation on **eight human OCT volume datasets** acquired from a commercial Spectralis OCT system. This suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors mention that each volume of data consists of **97 OCT images with a resolution of 496x512** and that these images are saved in **AVI video format**. This provides important information about the nature of the datasets.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors summarize their findings and reiterate the use of the eight OCT volume datasets, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. Therefore, I will need to refer to the **acknowledgments and references sections** to see if any prior works or datasets are cited that could be relevant.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets they used. However, they mention that their method is inspired by previous works, which may imply that the datasets could be similar to those used in those referenced studies.

Since the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **OCT Volume Datasets**: The paper mentions using eight human OCT volume datasets acquired from a commercial Spectralis OCT system. However, no specific citation is provided for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to note that while the datasets are described, specific citations are not available in this paper. This will be important for anyone reviewing the datasets to understand that they may need to look into the referenced works for more information.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: OCT Volume Datasets
- **Description**: Eight human OCT volume datasets acquired from a commercial Spectralis OCT system, each consisting of 97 OCT images with a resolution of 496x512, saved in AVI format.
- **Citation**: No specific citation provided in the paper.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for dataset information and documented it accurately, even in the absence of explicit citations.
