To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Symmetric and Asymmetric LSHs for Inner Product Search" by Behnam Neyshabur and Nathan Srebro, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or datasets**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are described). In this paper, I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical evaluations or comparisons. I will also check the **appendices** if they are present, as they sometimes contain additional details about datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using two collaborative filtering datasets: **Netflix** and **Movielens 10M**. These datasets are used for empirical evaluations of the proposed hashing methods.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. It is crucial to provide complete citations for proper attribution.

1. **Netflix Dataset**: The citation for the Netflix dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is widely known in the research community. A common reference is:
   > B. Bennett and S. Lanning. *The Netflix Prize. In Proceedings of KDD Cup and Workshop, 2007.*

2. **Movielens 10M Dataset**: The citation for the Movielens dataset is also commonly referenced:
   > J. Bennett and S. Lanning. *The Netflix Prize. In Proceedings of KDD Cup and Workshop, 2007.* (Note: The Movielens dataset is often cited in conjunction with the Netflix dataset, but it has its own references as well.)
   > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets.* Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

- **Netflix Dataset**: 
  > B. Bennett and S. Lanning. *The Netflix Prize. In Proceedings of KDD Cup and Workshop, 2007.*

- **Movielens 10M Dataset**: 
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets.* Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
