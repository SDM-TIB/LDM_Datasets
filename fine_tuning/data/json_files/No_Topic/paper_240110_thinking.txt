To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust quantum minimum finding with an application to hypothesis selection" by Yihui Quek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a quantum algorithm for noisy minimum finding and mentions its application to hypothesis selection, which may imply the use of datasets related to hypothesis testing.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, if the authors describe their experimental setup, I will pay close attention to any datasets they reference. For instance, if they mention using a specific dataset for hypothesis selection or testing their algorithm, I will note down the dataset's name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper references well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets. For example, if they use a dataset like the MNIST dataset, I will provide the citation for the original paper that introduced it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
