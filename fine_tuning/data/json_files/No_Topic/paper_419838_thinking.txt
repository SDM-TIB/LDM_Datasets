To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Transferability of Large-Scale Self-Supervision to Few-Shot Audio Classification" by Calum Heggan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates self-supervised models on few-shot audio classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.2 (Few-Shot Evaluation & SUPERB)**, where the authors explicitly mention that they conduct evaluations across ten datasets. This section is likely to contain the names and details of the datasets used in their experiments.

In **Table 2**, the authors summarize the few-shot datasets, which include:

1. **VoxCeleb1**: A dataset for speaker recognition with 1,251 classes and 153,516 samples.
2. **SpeechCommandsV2**: A dataset for keyword spotting with 35 classes and 105,829 samples.
3. **Crema-D**: A dataset for emotion recognition with 6 classes and 7,442 samples.
4. **Speech Accent Archive**: A dataset for accent recognition with 122 classes and 2,060 samples.
5. **Common Voice v12 Delta**: A language dataset with 88 classes and 256,243 samples.
6. **ESC-50**: An environmental sounds dataset with 50 classes and 2,000 samples.
7. **NSynth**: A dataset for musical instrument sounds with 41 classes and 305,978 samples.
8. **FDSKaggle18**: A mixed dataset with 32 classes and 11,073 samples.
9. **Watkins Marine Mammal**: A dataset for marine mammal sounds with 1,698 classes and 63,364 samples.
10. **BirdCLEF 2020 (Pruned)**: A dataset for bird song classification with 3 classes and 715 samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper references the following works that provide the necessary citations:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
