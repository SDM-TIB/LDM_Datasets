To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AIMS-EREA - A framework for AI-accelerated Innovation of Materials for Sustainability - for Environmental Remediation and Energy Applications," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it discusses the framework and its applications, it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, which discusses the need for novel materials and the role of AI in material discovery. It mentions the use of various databases and APIs but does not specify any datasets directly.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the tools and APIs used in their framework, such as the Materials Project API and the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD). This indicates that these databases are integral to their research, but I need to confirm if they are considered datasets in the context of this paper.

Moving to the **results and discussions section**, I will look for any specific datasets that were utilized in the experiments or analyses. The authors mention retrieving data from the Materials Project and OQMD, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used for their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the databases are as follows:

- For the **Materials Project**, the citation is:
  > A. Jain*, S.P. Ong*, G. Hautier, W. Chen, W.D. Richards, S. Dacek, S. Cholia, D. Gunter, D. Skinner, G. Ceder, K.A. Persson (*=equal contributions). The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation. *APL Materials*, 2013, 1(1), 011002.

- For the **Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)**, the citation is:
  > J. E. Saal, S. Kirklin, M. Aykol, B. Meredig, and C. Wolverton. Materials Design and Discovery with High-Throughput Density Functional Theory: The Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD). *JOM*, 65, 1501-1509 (2013). doi:10.1007/s11837-013-0755-4.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
