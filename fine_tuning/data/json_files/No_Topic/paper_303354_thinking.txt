To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Preserving Eye-tracking Using Deep Learning" by Salman Seyedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a deep learning model trained on images of individual faces, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the subsection titled **B. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used in their work, which consists of **610 video recordings from 493 participants** in the Emory Healthy Aging Study. This is a crucial piece of information as it directly relates to the dataset utilized in their experiments.

The authors also reference two other papers in this section, which may provide additional context or details about the dataset. I will note these references as they may contain important information about the dataset's origin or structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Emory Healthy Aging Study dataset. The authors cite two papers that are relevant to the dataset:

1. **Haque et al. (2019)**, which discusses a passive assessment of visuospatial memory in healthy aging and cognitive impairment. The citation is:
   > R. U. Haque, C. M. Manzanares, L. N. Brown, A. L. Pongos, J. J. Lah, G. D. Clifford, and A. I. Levey. *Vismet: a passive, efficient, and sensitive assessment of visuospatial memory in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease*. Learning & Memory, vol. 26, no. 3, pp. 93–100, 2019.

2. **Haque et al. (2020)**, which discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks for measuring cognitive impairment using eye-tracking. The citation is:
   > R. U. Haque, A. L. Pongos, C. M. Manzanares, J. J. Lah, A. I. Levey, and G. D. Clifford. *Deep convolutional neural networks and transfer learning for measuring cognitive impairment using eye-tracking in a distributed tablet-based environment*. IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, vol. 68, no. 1, pp. 11–18, 2020.

These citations will be important for providing proper attribution to the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
