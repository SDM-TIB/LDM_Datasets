To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel methods for estimating the instantaneous and overall COVID-19 case fatality risk among care home residents in England" by Christopher E. Overton et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from Public Health England and the Care Quality Commission to estimate the case fatality risk (CFR) among care home residents. This suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (section 2), which provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors mention two primary data sources:

1. **Public Health England (PHE) Data**: This dataset includes non-identifiable, time series data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections among care home residents, along with dates of death. It is crucial for estimating the CFR.

2. **Care Quality Commission (CQC) Data**: This dataset records the number of COVID-19 deaths in each English care home, categorized by type of death (e.g., confirmed COVID, suspected COVID). It is also essential for the analysis.

In the **Appendices**, particularly Appendix A, the authors provide further details about these datasets, including how they were collected and linked. This information is vital for understanding the context and reliability of the datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are government datasets. However, I can reference the organizations responsible for these datasets:

- For **Public Health England**, I will cite:
  > Public Health England. Public Health England data series on deaths in people with COVID-19, accessed on [insert access date].

- For **Care Quality Commission**, I will cite:
  > Care Quality Commission. Care home locations and deaths data, accessed on [insert access date].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
