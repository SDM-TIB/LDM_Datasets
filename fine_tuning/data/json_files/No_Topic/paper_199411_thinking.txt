To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Achieving Fairness through Adversarial Learning: an Application to Recidivism Prediction," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **public criminal records data from Broward County, Florida**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they explicitly state that they used **public criminal records data from Broward County, Florida**, which is compiled and published by ProPublica. This is a crucial dataset for their research, as it includes COMPAS scores for inmates, allowing for a comparison of their model's performance against COMPAS.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference ProPublica's work, which is essential for providing proper attribution.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., and Kirchner, L. Machine bias. ProPublica, 2016.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Broward County Criminal Records Dataset**: This dataset includes criminal records and COMPAS scores for inmates in Broward County, Florida. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed adversarial model in predicting recidivism.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary information is captured accurately and that proper credit is given to the original sources.
