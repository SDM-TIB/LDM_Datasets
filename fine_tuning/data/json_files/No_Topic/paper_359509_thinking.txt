To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pseudo AI Bias" by Xiaoming Zhai and Joseph Krajcik, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of Pseudo AI Bias (PAIB) and its implications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss examples or case studies related to AI bias. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used in the studies or analyses presented. For instance, the paper discusses various examples of AI bias, such as the Amazon AI recruiting tool and the COMPAS algorithm, but I need to determine if any specific datasets were used in these examples.

As I read through the paper, I will look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or provide additional context. For example, Table 1 presents definitions of bias but does not list datasets. However, I will keep an eye out for any references to datasets in the context of the studies cited.

In the **references section**, I will look for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the studies discussed. For example, the paper cites works by Cheuk (2021), Obermeyer et al. (2019), and Larrazabal et al. (2020), which may involve datasets relevant to the discussion of AI bias.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile a list of datasets mentioned or implied in the text, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. For instance, if I find that the Larrazabal et al. (2020) study used a specific medical imaging dataset, I will include that dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the following information:
- **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
- **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
- **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

By following this structured approach, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively from the paper on Pseudo AI Bias.
