To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early warning in egg production curves from commercial hens: A SVM approach" by Iván Ramírez Morales et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets or data sources. The abstract indicates that the study uses "farm's egg production data of 478,919 laying hens grouped in 24 flocks," which suggests that this data is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the data. The introduction discusses the importance of monitoring egg production and mentions that data has been collected over a period of seven years from a poultry company. This reinforces the significance of the dataset used in the study.

In the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically in **2.1 Data description**, the authors provide a detailed account of the dataset. They describe the dataset as consisting of egg production data from 24 flocks of ISA Brown, Lohmann Brown, and H&N layer lines, collected over seven years (January 2008 to December 2014). The data includes various indicators such as production time, housed birds, dead birds, total eggs produced, and average eggs per day.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the dataset. For instance, **Table 1** presents the main production indicators for each flock, which provides a comprehensive overview of the dataset's structure and contents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset appears to be original data collected by the authors from a specific poultry company, there may not be a formal citation for it in the same way that published datasets are typically referenced.

Given that the dataset is unique to this study, I will create a description for it, ensuring to include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset, along with the context of its use in the research.

The dataset entry will be structured as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Egg Production Data
2. **Description**: A dataset containing egg production data from 478,919 laying hens grouped in 24 flocks over a period of seven years (January 2008 to December 2014). The data includes production time, housed birds, dead birds, total eggs produced, and average eggs per day.
3. **Citation**: Iván Ramírez Morales, Daniel Rivero Cebrián, Enrique Fernández Blanco, Alejandro Pazos Sierra. *Early warning in egg production curves from commercial hens: A SVM approach*. 

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and provided the necessary citation for future reference.
