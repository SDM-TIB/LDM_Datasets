To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masader Plus: A New Interface for Exploring +500 Arabic NLP Datasets" by Yousef Altaher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract mentions the creation of a web interface for exploring Arabic NLP datasets, which suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets, which is likely to be found in the **methodology** or **system description** sections. In this paper, I will focus on **section 4 (Architecture and Features)**, where the authors describe the functionalities of Masader Plus. Here, they mention that the system allows users to explore over 500 Arabic NLP datasets, but I need to find specific names and details of these datasets.

I will also check **section 4.1 (Masader APIs)**, where the authors provide information about the API endpoints that return lists of available datasets. This section may contain specific dataset names and their features.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. The paper cites the original work on Masader by Alyafeai et al. (2021), which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

In the **References**, I will look for any additional papers or resources that provide detailed information about the datasets included in Masader. If the datasets are derived from other works, I will ensure to cite those original sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for further processing or review.
