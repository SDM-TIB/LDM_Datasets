To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Did You Think Would Happen? Explaining Agent Behaviour through Intended Outcomes" by Herman Yau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 5, where they evaluate their approach on three standard environments: **Blackjack, Cartpole, and Taxi**. I will carefully read through this section to identify any specific datasets or environments that are used for evaluation.

In the experiments section, the authors mention that they used **OpenAI Gym** for their experiments, which is a well-known toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This indicates that the datasets are likely derived from the environments provided by OpenAI Gym.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. Since the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for Blackjack, Cartpole, and Taxi, I will refer to the original sources or documentation for these environments:

1. **OpenAI Gym**: The citation for OpenAI Gym is:
   > Greg Brockman, Vicki Cheung, Ludwig Pettersson, Jonas Schneider, John Schulman, Jie Tang, and Wojciech Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. 2016. URL: https://gym.openai.com/

2. **Blackjack**: The Blackjack environment is part of OpenAI Gym, so it does not have a separate citation.

3. **Cartpole**: The Cartpole environment is also part of OpenAI Gym, so it does not have a separate citation.

4. **Taxi**: The Taxi environment is included in OpenAI Gym, so it does not have a separate citation.

Since the environments are part of OpenAI Gym, I will document the citation for OpenAI Gym as the authoritative source for these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for OpenAI Gym, which encompasses the datasets used in the experiments. This will provide a clear and concise reference for anyone reviewing the datasets utilized in this research.
