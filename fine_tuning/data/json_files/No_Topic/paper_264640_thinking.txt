To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shortfall Deviation Risk: An Alternative for Risk Measurement" by Marcelo Brutti Righi and Paulo Sergio Ceretta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of the Shortfall Deviation Risk (SDR) and its comparison with other risk measures, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **illustrations and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. In the **illustrations section**, the authors mention using "real and simulated data" to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SDR measure. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

In the **Monte Carlo simulations section**, the authors describe generating data using an auto-regressive (AR) process and a generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. They specify that the data is based on the daily returns of the North American market index Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P500). This is a significant dataset, and I will note it down.

The authors also mention using historical simulation (HS) for estimating risk measures, but they do not provide a specific dataset name for this method. However, since they are using the S&P500 index, I will focus on that as the primary dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The S&P500 index is a well-known dataset, and I can provide a standard citation for it:

- For the S&P500 index, the citation is:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/ (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets or specific citations for the simulated data, I will only include the S&P500 index in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the S&P500 index, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
