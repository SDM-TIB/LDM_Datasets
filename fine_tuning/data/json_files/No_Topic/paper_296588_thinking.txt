To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme Rotation Estimation using Dense Correlation Volumes" by Ruojin Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly list datasets, it can hint at their presence. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used, which can help in identifying them.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **StreetLearn**: This dataset contains approximately 143K panoramic views covering the cities of Manhattan and Pittsburgh, with a focus on a subset of roughly 56K images from Manhattan.

2. **SUN360**: An indoor dataset that includes 9,962 panoramic views of various scenes, grouped into 50 categories, with around 7,500 panoramas used for training and 830 for testing.

3. **InteriorNet**: A synthetic indoor dataset consisting of 10,050 panoramic views from 112 different houses, with a training set of 82 houses and a test set of 30 houses.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **StreetLearn**:
  > Piotr Mirowski, Andras Banki-Horvath, Keith Anderson, Denis Teplyashin, Karl Moritz Hermann, Mateusz Malinowski, Matthew Koichi Grimes, Karen Simonyan, Koray Kavukcuoglu, Andrew Zisserman, et al. *The StreetLearn environment and dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.01292, 2019.

- For **SUN360**:
  > Jianxiong Xiao, Krista A Ehinger, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *Recognizing scene viewpoint using panoramic place representation*. In CVPR, pages 2695â€“2702, 2012.

- For **InteriorNet**:
  > Wenbin Li, Sajad Saeedi, John McCormac, Ronald Clark, Dimos Tzoumanikas, Qing Ye, Yuzhong Huang, Rui Tang, and Stefan Leutenegger. *InteriorNet: Mega-scale multi-sensor photo-realistic indoor scenes dataset*. In BMVC, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
