To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Explain or Not to Explain: A Study on the Necessity of Explanations for Autonomous Vehicles" by Shanduojiao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a "self-driving explanation dataset" with first-person explanations and measures of necessity for 1103 video clips, which suggests a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, particularly the **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide comprehensive information. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset in the **Dataset** section, where they mention the "self-driving explanation necessity dataset" that augments the Berkeley Deep Drive Attention dataset. They specify that this dataset contains 1103 driving video clips, annotated with explanation content, explanation necessity scores, and other relevant metadata.

I will also check the **References** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following datasets:

1. **Berkeley Deep Drive Attention (BDD-A) dataset**: This dataset is used as the base for their self-driving explanation dataset. The citation is:
   > Xia, Y., Zhang, D., Kim, J., Nakayama, K., Zipser, K., & Whitney, D. (2019). Predicting Driver Attention in Critical Situations. In Computer Vision – ACCV 2018 (pp. 658–674). Springer International Publishing.

2. **Berkeley Deep Drive Explanation (BDD-X) dataset**: Although the authors primarily focus on their new dataset, they reference this dataset as well. The citation is:
   > Kim, J., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Canny, J., & Akata, Z. (2018). Textual Explanations for Self-Driving Vehicles. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Self-Driving Explanation Necessity Dataset**: Contains 1103 video clips with annotations for explanation necessity and first-person perspective explanations.
   - Citation: Jiang, S., Shen, Y., Chen, Y., Yang, E., Jin, X., Driggs-Campbell, K., & Fan, Y. (2020). To Explain or Not to Explain: A Study on the Necessity of Explanations for Autonomous Vehicles. In Proceedings of the UIST 2020 Conference.

2. **Berkeley Deep Drive Attention Dataset**: Used as the base for the self-driving explanation dataset.
   - Citation: Xia, Y., Zhang, D., Kim, J., Nakayama, K., Zipser, K., & Whitney, D. (2019). Predicting Driver Attention in Critical Situations. In Computer Vision – ACCV 2018 (pp. 658–674). Springer International Publishing.

3. **Berkeley Deep Drive Explanation Dataset**: Referenced for comparison and context.
   - Citation: Kim, J., Rohrbach, A., Darrell, T., Canny, J., & Akata, Z. (2018). Textual Explanations for Self-Driving Vehicles. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
