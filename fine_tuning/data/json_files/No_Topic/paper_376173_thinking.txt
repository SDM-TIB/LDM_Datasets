To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advanced Distributed Submarine Cable Monitoring and Environmental Sensing using Constant Power Probe Signals and Coherent Detection" by Mikael Mazur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, results, and conclusions sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of monitoring submarine cables and mention various techniques for environmental sensing. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup** section, where the authors describe their prototype system and its components. While this section provides technical details, it does not mention any datasets either.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any figures or tables that might reference datasets used in the experiments. The figures show measurements and comparisons but do not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will check the **conclusions section** to see if the authors summarize any datasets used in their research. They discuss the implications of their findings but do not mention specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will consult the **References section** to identify any external datasets that may have been referenced. The references include various studies related to submarine cable monitoring and environmental sensing, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

I will compile the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the references that are relevant to the study. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used in their experiments, I will ensure to include the citation in the appropriate format.

Once I have identified and cited all relevant datasets, I will prepare the information for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
