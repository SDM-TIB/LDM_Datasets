To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Discovery of Faster System Configurations with Spectral Learning" by Vivek Nair et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets or systems used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention six real-world configurable systems used for evaluation: **Berkeley DB, Apache Web server, SQLite, LLVM compiler, and x264 video encoder**. They also note that SQLite has a particularly large number of configurations, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's complexity.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or systems mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset or system.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of configurations, type of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset or system, as found in the references section.

Based on the information gathered, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
