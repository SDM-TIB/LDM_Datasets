To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Deep Learning Formalism for Processing Graph Signals" by Myriam Bontonou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the study's focus, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **results section**, as this is where the authors typically describe their experiments and the datasets utilized. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors discuss various deep learning models for processing graph signals, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments. Therefore, I will need to check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works referenced. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several foundational papers related to graph neural networks, which may imply the use of datasets associated with those works. I will extract the full citations for these references to ensure proper attribution.

The references include:

1. **Defferrard et al. (2016)**: 
   > M. Defferrard, X. Bresson, and P. Vandergheynst. *Convolutional neural networks on graphs with fast localized spectral filtering*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2016, pp. 3844–3852.

2. **Du et al. (2017)**: 
   > J. Du, S. Zhang, G. Wu, J. M. Moura, and S. Kar. *Topology adaptive graph convolutional networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10370, (2017).

3. **Kipf and Welling (2016)**: 
   > T. N. Kipf and M. Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907, (2016).

4. **Velickovic et al. (2017)**: 
   > P. Velickovic, G. Cucurull, A. Casanova, A. Romero, P. Liò, and Y. Bengio. *Graph attention networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10903, (2017).

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the datasets associated with these references may be relevant for understanding the context of the research. 

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned or implied in the paper.
