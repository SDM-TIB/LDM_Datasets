To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mapping molecular complexes with Super-Resolution Microscopy and Single-Particle Analysis" by Afonso Mendes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as **"Methods" or "Results"**. These sections typically contain information about the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to specific datasets related to super-resolution microscopy or single-particle analysis, I will highlight those.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several datasets related to specific biological structures and their analysis using super-resolution microscopy techniques. For example, they discuss datasets related to the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), HIV-1, and other viral structures.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to the Nuclear Pore Complex, I will look for the original research paper or resource that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, journal, volume, pages, and year of publication for each dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
