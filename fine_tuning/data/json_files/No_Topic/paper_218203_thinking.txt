To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persistent Homology Detects Curvature" by Peter Bubenik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of persistent homology and mentions a computational framework, but does not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention sampling points from disks of constant curvature and computing pairwise distances. They also refer to using average death vectors and average persistence landscapes, which suggests that they are working with generated datasets rather than publicly available ones.

I will look for any specific datasets or data generation methods mentioned in **subsections 4.1 (Sampling points)** and **4.2 (Average death vectors and average persistence landscapes)**. Here, the authors describe how they sample points uniformly from disks of constant curvature, but they do not cite any external datasets. Instead, they generate their own data based on theoretical models.

In **subsection 4.3 (Supervised learning)**, the authors mention using training data derived from their sampling methods, but again, these are not external datasets. They describe the process of estimating curvature using their generated data.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the datasets used in the experiments are generated by the authors based on their theoretical framework rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Now, I will compile the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **Generated Datasets**: The authors generated datasets by sampling points from disks of constant curvature (K = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2) using specific sampling methods described in the paper. These datasets are not publicly available and are created for the purpose of this research.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as they do not exist in this context. Instead, I will summarize the methodology used to generate the datasets.

In conclusion, the paper primarily discusses generated datasets based on theoretical models rather than utilizing existing datasets. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.
