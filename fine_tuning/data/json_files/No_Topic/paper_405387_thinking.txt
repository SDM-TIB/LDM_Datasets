To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Trained Language Models Augmented with Synthetic Scanpaths for Natural Language Understanding" by Shuwen Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the scarcity of gaze data and the development of a model that integrates synthetic scanpaths, which suggests that datasets related to gaze tracking and NLP tasks may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, specifically the **3.1 Data Sets** subsection, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CELER**: The authors state that they pre-train the scanpath generation model Eyettention on the L1 subset of CELER, which contains eye-tracking recordings from 69 native speakers of English during the reading of 5,456 sentences.

2. **ETSA**: This dataset contains task-specific gaze recordings for sentiment classification, involving 7 subjects who read 383 positive and 611 negative sentences.

3. **GLUE**: The authors mention that this benchmark includes various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, linguistic acceptability, and natural language inference, but note that no gaze data is available for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CELER**, the citation is:
  > Berzak, Y., Nakamura, C., Smith, A., Weng, E., Katz, B., Flynn, S., & Levy, R. (2022). CELER: A 365-participant corpus of eye movements in L1 and L2 English reading. *Open Mind*, 1–10.

- For **ETSA**, the citation is:
  > Mishra, A., Bhattacharyya, P., Mishra, A., & Bhattacharyya, P. (2016). Predicting readers’ sarcasm understandability by modeling gaze behavior. In *Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence* (Vol. 30). 

- For **GLUE**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. (2018). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. In *Proceedings of EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP*, 353–355.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
