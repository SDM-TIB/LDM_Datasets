To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information Spillover in Multiple Zero-Sum Games" by Lucas Pahl, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise summary of the research, and any datasets used for analysis or experiments may be highlighted there.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss the model, results, and experiments. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were used in the analysis.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will pay close attention to this part, as it often contains specific information about the datasets used to validate the research findings. I will note any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and how they contribute to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the details into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further use or analysis.
