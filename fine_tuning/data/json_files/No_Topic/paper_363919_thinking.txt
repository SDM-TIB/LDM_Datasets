To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proactive Resilient Transmission and Scheduling Mechanisms for mmWave Networks" by Mine Gokce Dogan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will look for mentions of datasets in the **results or evaluation sections**. Authors often describe the datasets they used to validate their findings in these sections.

Once I identify any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided in the text. For example, if the authors mention a specific dataset used for training or testing their algorithms, I will record that information.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a quick search to find the original source of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, complete with proper attribution.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
