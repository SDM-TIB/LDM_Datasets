To extract datasets from the research paper titled "iSPA-Net: Iterative Semantic Pose Alignment Network" by Jogendra Nath Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on various real image viewpoint estimation datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in the experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4). Here, the authors explicitly state that they achieve state-of-the-art results on two viewpoint estimation datasets: **PASCAL 3D+** and **ObjectNet3D**. I will note down these datasets and look for further details about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for both datasets, confirming their use in the evaluation of the proposed method. This reinforces that these datasets are critical to the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **PASCAL 3D+**, the citation is:
   > Yu Xiang, Roozbeh Mottaghi, and Silvio Savarese. *Beyond Pascal: A Benchmark for 3D Object Detection in the Wild*. In WACV, 2014.

2. For **ObjectNet3D**, the citation is:
   > Yu Xiang, Wonhui Kim, Wei Chen, Jingwei Ji, Christopher Choy, Hao Su, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Leonidas Guibas, and Silvio Savarese. *ObjectNet3D: A Large Scale Database for 3D Object Recognition*. In ECCV, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PASCAL 3D+**: A dataset that contains images from the PASCAL dataset and ImageNet, labeled with both detection and continuous pose annotations for 12 rigid object categories.
- **ObjectNet3D**: A large-scale dataset consisting of diverse categories and images, specifically designed for 3D object recognition tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
