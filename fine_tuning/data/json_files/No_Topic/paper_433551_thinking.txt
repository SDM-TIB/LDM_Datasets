To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facilitating Advanced Sentinel-2 Analysis Through a Simplified Computation of Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance" by David Montero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a Python package called **sen2nbar** for converting Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data to Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). This indicates that the Sentinel-2 data is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to the **Sentinel-2 (S2) mission** and its Level-2A products, which provide surface reflectance data. This suggests that the Sentinel-2 Level-2A data is a key dataset utilized in their analysis.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the use of Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs) derived from cloud-stored data and SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC). They mention that the sen2nbar package supports both individual Sentinel-2 images and ESDCs, indicating that these are also datasets of interest.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional datasets or specific applications of the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the use of ESDCs generated for specific case studies, such as the Hainich Natural National Park area, which indicates that this specific ESDC is another dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Sentinel-2 Level-2A Data**: The citation for the Sentinel-2 mission is:
   > Drusch, M., Del Bello, U., Carlier, S., Colin, O., Fernandez, V., Gascon, F., Hoersch, B., Isola, C., Laberinti, P., Martimort, P., Meygret, A., Spoto, F., Sy, O., Marchese, F., Bargellini, P. (2012). Sentinel-2: ESA’s optical high-resolution mission for GMES operational services. *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 120, 25-36. doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2011.11.026.

2. **Earth System Data Cubes (ESDCs)**: The citation for the concept of ESDCs is:
   > Mahecha, M. D., Gans, F., Brandt, G., Christiansen, R., Cornell, S. E., Fomferra, N., Kraemer, G., Peters, J., Bodesheim, P., Camps-Valls, G., Donges, J. F., Dorigo, W., Estupinan-Suarez, L. M., Gutierrez-Velez, V. H., Gutwin, M., Jung, M., Londoño, M. C., Miralles, D. G., Papastefanou, P., Reichstein, M. (2020). Earth system data cubes unravel global multivariate dynamics. *Earth System Dynamics*, 11(1), 201-234. doi: 10.5194/esd-11-201-2020.

3. **Hainich Natural National Park ESDC**: The specific ESDC case study is cited as:
   > Montero, D., Aybar, C., Mahecha, M. D., Martinuzzi, F., Söchting, M., Wieneke, S. (2023a). A standardized catalogue of spectral indices to advance the use of remote sensing in earth system research. *Scientific Data*, 10(1). doi: 10.1038/s41597-023-02096-0.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
