To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TeaForN: Teacher-Forcing with N-grams" by Sebastian Goodman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several benchmarks, specifically mentioning "one Machine Translation benchmark, WMT 2014 English-French," and "two News Summarization benchmarks, CNN/Dailymail and Gigaword." This suggests that these benchmarks are datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for Machine Translation:

1. **WMT 2014 English-French**: This dataset consists of a large collection of sentence pairs for training and testing machine translation models. The authors note that it includes 36 million sentence pairs for training and 3,003 for testing.

2. **CNN/Dailymail**: This dataset is described as containing 93,000 CNN articles and 220,000 Daily Mail articles, with bullet-style summaries provided for each article.

3. **Gigaword**: This dataset includes 4 million articles from various publishers, where the headlines serve as summaries.

In section 4.2, the authors confirm that they used the **CNN/Dailymail** and **Gigaword** datasets for their News Summarization experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WMT 2014**, the citation is:
  > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:1806.00187, 2018.

- For **CNN/Dailymail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching Machines to Read and Comprehend*. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:1506.03340, 2015.

- For **Gigaword**, the citation is:
  > Alexander M. Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization*. arXiv e-prints, page arXiv:1509.00685, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations for inclusion in the required format. Each dataset will be clearly identified along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
