To extract datasets from the research paper titled "District-scale surface temperatures generated from high-resolution longitudinal thermal infrared images" by Subin Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper describes a dataset collected using infrared thermography, which suggests that there are specific datasets related to thermal images.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including the number of thermal images collected and the locations from which they were captured. They mention that the dataset includes 1,365,921 thermal images collected over ten months from two locations: Kent Vale and S16.

I will then summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Kent Vale Dataset**: This dataset consists of 483,915 thermal images taken from the Kent Vale observatory between November 8, 2021, and March 8, 2022. The images are categorized based on different views of buildings and include a variety of urban elements.

2. **S16 Dataset**: This dataset includes 882,006 thermal images collected from the S16 observatory between August 3, 2022, and December 14, 2022. Similar to the Kent Vale dataset, it captures thermal images of various urban features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The paper mentions that the datasets are published in Zenodo, which is an important detail for citation.

The full citation for the datasets is:
> Lin, S., Ramani, V., Martin, M., Arjunan, P., Chong, A., Biljecki, F., Ignatius, M., Poolla, K., & Miller, C. (2022). *Infrared investigation in Singapore (IRIS) dataset*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7463995

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and includes the full citation. This will allow for proper referencing and usage in future research or applications.
