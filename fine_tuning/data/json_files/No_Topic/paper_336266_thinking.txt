To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Face Verification Bypass" by Sanjana Sarda, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction will likely provide more detail about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, which is specifically dedicated to datasets. Here, the author describes two datasets:

1. **Human User Dataset**: This dataset consists of 310 images of the author's face collected over four years, capturing various lighting conditions, angles, and age variations. The images are cropped to a uniform dimension after extraction using a Caffe-based face detector.

2. **FairFace**: This dataset contains 108,501 face images that are race-balanced. Each image represents a unique user in the verification system, and similar to the Human User Dataset, the images are cropped to the same dimension after extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **Human User Dataset**, since it is a custom dataset created by the author, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is based on the author's own images.

For the **FairFace dataset**, I will find the citation:
- The citation for FairFace is:
  > Kimmo Karkkainen and Jungseock Joo. *FairFace: Face attribute dataset for balanced race, gender, and age for bias measurement and mitigation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 1548â€“1558, 2021.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the FairFace dataset and note the custom nature of the Human User Dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
