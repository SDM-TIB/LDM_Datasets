To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Interconnectedness of Cryptocurrencies using Correlation Networks" by Andrew Burnie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions two datasets: one with fourteen cryptocurrencies starting from November 9, 2017, and a subset with nine cryptocurrencies starting from September 9, 2016. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.3 (Selecting the Dataset)**, where the author describes the data collection process. The paper states that daily pricing data (in USD) was gathered from **coingecko.com** on March 6, 2018, for the cryptocurrencies considered. This source is crucial as it provides the data for both datasets mentioned.

The two datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset 1**: A dataset containing daily price data for fourteen cryptocurrencies starting from November 9, 2017, until March 6, 2018. This dataset is used to analyze the correlations among a broader range of cryptocurrencies.

2. **Dataset 2**: A subset of the first dataset, which includes nine cryptocurrencies starting from September 9, 2016, until March 6, 2018. This subset is used to enhance robustness in the analysis by providing more data points.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the source of the datasets. The paper cites **CoinGecko** as the source of the cryptocurrency data. The citation for CoinGecko is as follows:

- **CoinGecko**: CoinGecko. (2018). Methodology. Retrieved March 8, 2018, from https://www.coingecko.com/en/methodology

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries. The datasets are derived from the same source, so I will ensure to note that both datasets are based on the data collected from CoinGecko.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset description and the full citation for the source. This will ensure clarity and proper attribution for the datasets used in the research.
