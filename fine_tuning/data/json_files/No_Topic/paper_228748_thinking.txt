To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversify Your Datasets: Analyzing Generalization via Controlled Variance in Adversarial Datasets" by Ohad Rozen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "adversarial datasets" for stress-testing models, which suggests that specific datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by neural models in recognizing various inference phenomena and hint at the use of challenge datasets. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced that are used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their approach to generating datasets for two inference types: **dative alternation** and **numerical reasoning**. Here, they mention using the **MultiNLI dataset** as a source for extracting premises, which is crucial for understanding the datasets they created.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their findings using the datasets they generated. They specifically mention the **dative alternation dataset** and the **numerical reasoning dataset**, which are derived from the templates they created based on the MultiNLI dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MultiNLI Dataset**: The citation for the MultiNLI dataset is:
   > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112â€“1122. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Dative Alternation Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the MultiNLI dataset, so it does not have a separate citation. However, it is important to note that it is based on the templates created from the MultiNLI premises.

3. **Numerical Reasoning Dataset**: Similar to the dative alternation dataset, this dataset is also derived from the MultiNLI dataset and does not have a separate citation.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I clearly document the details of each dataset, including their purpose and how they were generated, while emphasizing the importance of the MultiNLI dataset as the foundational source for the generated datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
