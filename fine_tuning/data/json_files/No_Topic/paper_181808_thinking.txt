To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Canny: Edge Detection and Recovery with Open Active Contour Models" by Muhammet BasÂ¸tan, S. Saqib Bukhari, and Thomas M. Breuel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework introduced, but it may not specify datasets directly. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of edge detection and recovery but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then move to the **methodology** and **experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of their experiments or evaluations.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset** for evaluating their edge detection algorithm. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision, particularly for segmentation tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Arbelaez, P., Fowlkes, C., Martin, D. (n.d.). *The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Benchmark*. Retrieved from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/segbench

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the edge detection and recovery framework proposed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
