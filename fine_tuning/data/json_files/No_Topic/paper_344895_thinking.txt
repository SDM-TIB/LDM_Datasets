To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bi-SimCut: A Simple Strategy for Boosting Neural Machine Translation" by Pengzhi Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves strong translation performance across five translation benchmarks. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Baseline Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **IWSLT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset contains 160K parallel bilingual sentence pairs. The authors note that they lowercase all words in the dataset and build a shared dictionary with 10K byte-pair-encoding (BPE) types.

2. **WMT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4.5M parallel sentence pairs. The authors specify that they combine newstest2012 and newstest2013 as the validation set and use newstest2014 as the test set.

3. **WMT17 Chinese-English Dataset**: This dataset includes 20.2M training sentence pairs, with newsdev2017 as the validation set and newstest2017 as the test set.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **IWSLT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2012). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012).

- For the **WMT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., & Povolny, J. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

- For the **WMT17 Chinese-English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2017). *Findings of the 2017 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
