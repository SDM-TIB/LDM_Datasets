To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian model selection consistency and oracle inequality with intractable marginal likelihood" by Yun Yang and Debdeep Pati, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their study. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on..." or "the experiments were conducted using...".

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental design or data collection. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results** section, where the authors may refer back to the datasets used in their experiments to present findings or comparisons. This will help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide additional context.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include details such as the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining accuracy and completeness in the documentation process.
