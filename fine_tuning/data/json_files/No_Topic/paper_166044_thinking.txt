To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Representation for High-Level Norms and Violation Inference in Logic Programming" by B.O. Akinkunmi and Moyin F. Babalola, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies or examples.

Next, I will examine the **related works section** (Section 2) and the **experiments section** (if available) for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss various norm representation formalisms and cite previous works, which may include datasets used in those studies. 

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or provide data points relevant to the research. If the paper includes a **methodology section**, I will check for descriptions of any datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed formalism.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that the focus is more on theoretical contributions rather than empirical validation with datasets.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the related works and experiments sections for explicit dataset references.
3. Look for tables or figures summarizing datasets.
4. Check the references for full citations of any identified datasets.
5. Compile the information clearly, noting any absence of datasets if applicable.
