To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RDF Knowledge Graph Visualization From a Knowledge Extraction System" by Fadhela Kerdjoudj and Olivier Cur√©, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the system and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of knowledge extraction systems and the technologies involved, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will continue to the **Knowledge Extraction System** section, where they describe the processes involved in extracting RDF knowledge graphs.

As I read through **section 2 (Knowledge Extraction System)**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe various processes like deep morphosyntactic analysis and named entity recognition, but they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will check the **Visualization Features** section, where they discuss the ontology and graph features. While this section provides insight into the system's functionality, it does not mention specific datasets either.

Finally, I will examine the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and tools related to semantic web technologies, but they do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will summarize my findings and note that the paper focuses on a system for visualizing RDF knowledge graphs without referencing specific datasets.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not contain any datasets for extraction, and I will prepare a brief note on the lack of dataset references in the context of the research presented.
