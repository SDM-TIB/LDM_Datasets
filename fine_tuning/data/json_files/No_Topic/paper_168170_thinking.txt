To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Populations of Parameters" by Kevin Tian, Weihao Kong, and Gregory Valiant, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often contextualizes the work, potentially mentioning datasets used for validation or examples.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention applying their algorithm to various datasets, including:

1. **A dataset of 1M people** tracking flu occurrences over five years. This dataset is used to illustrate the estimation problem discussed in the paper.
2. **A dataset of dog litters** from the Norwegian Kennel Club, which contains information on the sex composition of puppies. This dataset is used to analyze the distribution of probabilities related to offspring sex ratios.
3. **A dataset on political tendencies** across 3,116 counties in the US, used to estimate the likelihood of voting Republican in elections.
4. **NBA player shooting statistics**, which are used to analyze game-to-game scoring probabilities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. If the datasets are derived from other studies or sources, I will ensure to provide the original citations.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **dataset of 1M people** regarding flu occurrences, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is a hypothetical dataset used for illustration.
  
- For the **dog litter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaja Borge and Ane NÃ¸dtvedt. *Anonymized dataset on sex composition of dog litters*. Norwegian Kennel Club.

- For the **political tendencies dataset**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Census Bureau. *Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2004*. 

- For the **NBA player shooting statistics**, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it can be referenced from:
  > NBA Stats. *Player Shooting Statistics*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and citation to ensure proper attribution and facilitate further research.
