To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty in Natural Language Processing: Sources, Quantification, and Applications" by Mengting Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail datasets, such as **section 4 (Applications of Uncertainty in NLP)**, where the authors discuss various applications and may reference datasets used in their experiments or analyses. I will also check the **references** throughout the paper for any citations that indicate datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their use in the research. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training or evaluation, I will note that down.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the authors mention a dataset like the **GLUE benchmark**, I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wang, A., Pruksachatkun, Y., Nangia, N., et al. (2019). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
