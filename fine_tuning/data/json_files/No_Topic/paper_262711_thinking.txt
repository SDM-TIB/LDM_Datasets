To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recognition and standardization of cardiac MRI orientation" by Ke Zhang and Xiahai Zhuang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of recognizing and standardizing cardiac MRI orientations, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that may have utilized datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains the most information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention evaluating their proposed method on the **MyoPS dataset** and the **ACDC dataset**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset:

1. **MyoPS Dataset**: This dataset is described as being similar to previous challenge data, providing multi-sequence CMR images and anatomy masks for various cardiac structures. It includes data from 45 patients with pathology masks for myocardial infarct and edema.

2. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset consists of single modality short-axis cardiac cine-MRIs from 100 subjects, categorized into groups based on cardiac abnormalities. Annotations are provided for various cardiac structures at different phases.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will locate the full citations for both datasets:

- For the **MyoPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., Cervenansky, F., Yang, X., Heng, P.A., Cetin, I., Lekadir, K., Camara, O., Ballester, M.A.G., et al. "Deep learning techniques for automatic MRI cardiac multi-structures segmentation and diagnosis: is the problem solved?" *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(11), 2514–2525, 2018.

- For the **ACDC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X. "Multivariate mixture model for cardiac segmentation from multi-sequence MRI." In *International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention*, pp. 581–588, Springer, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper references.
