To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Corpus-Steered Query Expansion with Large Language Models" by Yibin Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments" and "two high-resource web search datasets and six low-resource BEIR datasets," indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention:

1. **TREC DL19**: This dataset is described as a high-resource web search dataset, and it is referenced in the context of the experiments conducted.
2. **TREC DL20**: Similar to DL19, this is another high-resource web search dataset used in their experiments.
3. **BEIR datasets**: The authors state that they evaluated their method on six low-resource retrieval datasets from BEIR, which cover various domains.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **dataset statistics section** (A.2) for more specific information about the datasets, including the number of test cases and corpus size.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **TREC DL19**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820, 2020.

- For **TREC DL20**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07662, 2021.

- For the **BEIR datasets**, the citation is:
  > Nandan Thakur, Nils Reimers, Andreas Rücklé, Abhishek Srivastava, and Iryna Gurevych. *BEIR: A Heterogeneous Benchmark for Zero-Shot Evaluation of Information Retrieval Models*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
