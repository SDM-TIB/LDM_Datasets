To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Approach to Inference-Driven Dialogue Management within a Social Chatbot" by Sarah E. Finch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the chatbot's functionality, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the challenges of human-computer dialogue and the approach taken by the authors, but it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets used in previous studies. This section discusses existing dialogue systems but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **NLP Models section**, the authors mention that the ELIT models are trained on a combination of several datasets. Here, I will note the datasets mentioned:

1. **OntoNotes 5**: This dataset is referenced as a source for training the models. 
2. **BOLT English Treebanks**: Another dataset used for training.
3. **THYME/SHARP/MiPACQ Treebank**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the training data.
4. **English Web Treebank**: Included in the training datasets.
5. **Questionbank**: This dataset is referenced as well.
6. **AMR 3.0**: The authors mention this dataset as part of their training data.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. I will compile the citations as follows:

- **OntoNotes 5**:
  > Weischedel, Ralph, et al. "Ontonotes release 5.0." Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, 2013.

- **BOLT English Treebanks**:
  > Song, Zhiyi, et al. "BOLT English SMS/Chat." Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, 2019.

- **THYME/SHARP/MiPACQ Treebank**:
  > Albright, Daniel, et al. "Towards comprehensive syntactic and semantic annotations of the clinical narrative." Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 20(5):922–930, 2013.

- **English Web Treebank**:
  > Bies, Ann, et al. "English web treebank." Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA.

- **Questionbank**:
  > Judge, John, et al. "Questionbank: Creating a corpus of parse-annotated questions." In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 44th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 497–504, 2006.

- **AMR 3.0**:
  > Knight, Kevin, et al. "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotation release 3.0." Technical Report LDC2020T02, Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia, PA, June 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
