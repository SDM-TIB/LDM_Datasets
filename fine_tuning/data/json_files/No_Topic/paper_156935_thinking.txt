To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Study of Semi-supervised Approaches to Improving English-Mandarin Code-Switching Speech Recognition" by Pengcheng Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **South East Asian Mandarin-English (SEAME) data**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research. 

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the SEAME corpus. They describe it as a microphone-based spontaneous conversational bilingual speech corpus, which includes utterances from 154 overseas Chinese speakers in Malaysia and Singapore. This section confirms that the SEAME corpus is a significant dataset used in their experiments.

In **subsection 2.2 (Test data definition)**, the authors define two evaluation datasets: **evalman** and **evalsge**. They provide statistics for these datasets, including the number of speakers and the duration of recordings, which further emphasizes their importance in the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The SEAME corpus is referenced in the paper, and I will ensure to extract the citation accurately.

The citation for the SEAME corpus is:
> D.-C. Lyu, T.-P. Tan, E.-S. Chng, and H. Li. *An analysis of a Mandarin-English code-switching speech corpus: SEAME*. Age, vol. 21, pp. 25â€“8, 2010.

The evaluation datasets, evalman and evalsge, are derived from the SEAME corpus, so they do not have separate citations. Instead, I will note that they are subsets of the SEAME corpus.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **SEAME Corpus**: A bilingual speech corpus used for code-switching speech recognition, containing spontaneous conversations in Mandarin and English.
2. **evalman**: An evaluation dataset dominated by Mandarin, derived from the SEAME corpus.
3. **evalsge**: An evaluation dataset dominated by English, also derived from the SEAME corpus.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
