To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Seismic wave propagation and inversion with Neural Operators" by Yan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a trained Neural Operator for seismic wave simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these simulations.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the computational costs associated with seismic wave simulations and the need for new simulations when properties change. This indicates that they likely used datasets generated from simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe how they constructed their training dataset. They mention generating a training dataset of simulations by creating 5,000 random velocity models and applying a Ricker wavelet source to each model. This is a clear indication of a dataset being created for their experiments.

The authors specify that the dataset consists of 5,000 data samples, each representing a different simulation of the acoustic wave equation. This dataset is crucial for training the Neural Operator model.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets used for validation or testing. They discuss the performance of the model on various velocity models, but they do not introduce new datasets here; rather, they validate the model using the training dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methods referenced in the paper. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves, there may not be an external citation for it. Instead, I will note the details of the dataset as described in the methods section.

The dataset I will document is:

1. **Training Dataset of Simulations**: This dataset consists of 5,000 simulations generated from random velocity models, each with a Ricker wavelet source applied. The details of the dataset creation process are outlined in the methods section.

Since this dataset is original to the authors and does not have an external citation, I will note it as follows:

- **Training Dataset of Simulations**: Yan Yang, Angela F. Gao, Jorge C. Castellanos, Zachary E. Ross, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, and Robert W. Clayton. *Seismic wave propagation and inversion with Neural Operators*. In Proceedings of the [Conference/Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year]. (Note: Replace placeholders with actual details if available).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
