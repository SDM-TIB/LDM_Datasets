To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Information More Valuable" by Mark Whitmeyer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a concise overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific mentions.

Next, I will focus on sections that typically contain empirical data or case studies, such as **section 6 (Two Applications)**, where the author discusses applications related to delegation and selling information. These sections often include references to datasets used for analysis or examples.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used. If the paper refers to datasets from other studies or sources, I will ensure to capture those references as well.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for any papers or sources cited that provide the datasets or describe them in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the corresponding citation, which might look something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
