To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segmentation of Soft Atherosclerotic Plaques Using Active Contour Models" by M Moazzam Jawaid, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it often details the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to the datasets in relation to the findings of the study. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that rely on specific datasets.

I will also review the **discussion section** to see if the authors reflect on the datasets used, their significance, or any limitations associated with them.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset from the **references section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the "Coronary Artery Disease Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for it in external databases or publications.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to any specific formatting or structuring guidelines as required.

By following these steps, I will systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, ensuring that I provide accurate and complete citations for each one.
