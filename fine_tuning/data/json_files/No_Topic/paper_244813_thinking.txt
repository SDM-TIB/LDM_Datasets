To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian-Deep Learning model for estimating Covid-19 evolution in Spain" by Stefano Cabras, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the data used.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of understanding and predicting the evolution of Covid-19 in Spain, which suggests that data is crucial for the analysis. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (Section 3.1)**, where the author explicitly mentions the source of the data. Here, the author states that the data comes from the **Instituto Carlos III de Madrid** and can be downloaded in CSV format from a specific URL. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

The paper specifies that the dataset includes the total number of reported Covid-19 cases, which is aggregated over a 14-day period for reliability. This dataset is crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

Now, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Instituto Carlos III de Madrid**. "COVID-19 Cases Data." Available at: https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/resources/casos_diag_ccaadecl.csv.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or documentation.
