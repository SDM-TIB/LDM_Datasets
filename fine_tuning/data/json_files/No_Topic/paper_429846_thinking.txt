To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAN with Skip Patch Discriminator for Biological Electron Microscopy Image Generation" by Nishith Ranjon Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the study. The introduction will likely provide more details about the datasets used, especially in the context of the challenges faced in generating electron microscopy images.

In **section 1.1 (Dataset)**, the authors specifically mention the **Drosophila dataset**. They describe it as consisting of 20 images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024, which includes mitochondria and cell membrane masks, as well as EM images. This section is crucial as it provides both the name and a brief description of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Drosophila dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- **Drosophila dataset**: 
  > S. Gerhard, J. Funke, J. Martel, A. Cardona, and R. Fetter. “Segmented anisotropic ssTEM dataset of neural tissue,” (2013), figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.856713

This citation includes the authors, title, year, and a link to the dataset, which is essential for proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Drosophila dataset**: Contains 20 images of mitochondria and cell membrane masks, with a resolution of 1024 × 1024.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
