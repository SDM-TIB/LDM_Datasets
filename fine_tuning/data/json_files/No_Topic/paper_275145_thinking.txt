To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attack-Resilient Pulse-Based Synchronization Strategy for General Connected Topologies" by Zhenqian Wang and Yongqiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used for numerical simulations or evaluations of the proposed synchronization mechanism. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper refers to existing datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe those datasets to ensure I have the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
