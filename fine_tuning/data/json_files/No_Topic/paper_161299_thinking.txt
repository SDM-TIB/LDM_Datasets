To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Non-Additive Path Learning under Full and Partial Information" by Corinna Cortes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may contain references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or the nature of the data.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **appendices** or **references** for any supplementary materials or citations that might provide additional information about the datasets.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This is usually the title or a commonly accepted name.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., images, text, etc.) and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full citation**: I will look for the original source or publication where the dataset was introduced or described. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if I find a dataset named "XYZ Dataset" in the experiments section, I will note down its description and then check the references section for its citation. If the citation is not directly available, I may need to search for it online to ensure I have the correct and complete reference.

After compiling all the necessary information, I will format the dataset entries according to the required structure, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset documentation.
