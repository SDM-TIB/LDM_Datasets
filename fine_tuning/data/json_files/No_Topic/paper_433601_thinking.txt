To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models" by Liexin Cheng, Xue Cheng, and Xianhua Peng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Joint Calibration)**, as it is likely to contain specific details about the datasets utilized for calibration. In this section, the authors mention that the data spans two years, containing the implied volatility surfaces of the S&P 500 and the VIX from January 3, 2023, to February 28, 2023. This indicates that there is a dataset related to SPX and VIX options.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or provide additional context. For example, the paper includes tables with calibration results, which may reference the datasets used.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets:

1. **SPX Options Dataset**: The authors mention that the final sample consists of 162,438 SPX options, with a daily average of 4,165 options. This dataset is crucial for the calibration process.

2. **VIX Options Dataset**: The paper states that there are 10,254 VIX options in the final sample, with a daily average of 263 options. This dataset is also essential for the calibration.

Next, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper. The authors reference the work of Bardgett et al. (2019) for the data cleaning procedure, which is important for understanding the dataset's context.

The full citation for the SPX options dataset is:
> Chris Bardgett, Elise Gourier, and Markus Leippold. *Inferring volatility dynamics and risk premia from the S&P 500 and VIX markets*. Journal of Financial Economics, 131(3):593â€“618, 2019.

The full citation for the VIX options dataset is also from the same source, as it discusses the implied volatility surfaces of both SPX and VIX options.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
