To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Radio Traffic Sequence Recognition with Deep Recurrent Neural Networks" by Timothy J. O’Shea et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses using deep recurrent neural networks for traffic type recognition, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Supervised Traffic Type Learning)**, where the authors describe their dataset generation process. They mention capturing network traffic from various applications, which indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments. I will look for a detailed list of the applications and protocols included in the dataset.

In the **Dataset Generation subsection**, the authors provide a list of applications from which they captured network traffic, including:

1. **Video Streaming (via ABC video)**
2. **Video Streaming (via YouTube)**
3. **Music Streaming (via Spotify)**
4. **Utilities** such as:
   - Apt-get
   - ICMP Response Test (Ping)
   - Version Control (git)
   - Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
5. **Downloading/Browsing** including:
   - BitTorrent
   - Web browsing
   - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
   - HTTP Download

This list indicates the types of traffic included in their dataset, but I need to confirm if they provide a specific name for the dataset.

In the **Discriminative Model Training subsection**, the authors mention that they publish their datasets on radioml.com. This suggests that there is a publicly available dataset that I can reference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they reference their previous work where they may have discussed the dataset in detail. The relevant citation is:

- O’Shea, T. J., Corgan, J., & Clancy, T. C. (2016). *Convolutional radio modulation recognition networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.04105.

This citation refers to their earlier work that likely includes information about the dataset they used for training and testing.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the paper, along with their proper citations for future reference.
