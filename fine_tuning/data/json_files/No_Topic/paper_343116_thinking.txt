To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Branch Prior-SegNet: CNN for Interventional CBCT using Planning Scan and Auxiliary Segmentation Loss" by Philipp Ernst et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific dataset names or descriptions in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference a previous work by Ghosh et al. (2022) that incorporates a planning scan for reconstruction. However, I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the training data. They mention that the training data was simulated by combining **LungCT-Diagnosis** volumes and in-house needle scans. This indicates that these two datasets are relevant for the study.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model but do not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will confirm that the two datasets identified in the methods section are indeed the only ones used.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets:

1. For the **LungCT-Diagnosis** dataset, the citation is:
   > Olya Grove, Anders E. Berglund, Matthew B. Schabath, et al. Data from: Quantitative computed tomographic descriptors associate tumor shape complexity and intratumor heterogeneity with prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma, 2015. URL: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/x/8IUiAQ.

2. The in-house needle scans do not have a formal citation since they are not published datasets, but I will note that they are part of the authors' own data collection.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the LungCT-Diagnosis dataset and a note regarding the in-house dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any downstream processing.
