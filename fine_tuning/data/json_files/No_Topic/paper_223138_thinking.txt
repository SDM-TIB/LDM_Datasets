To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hateful People or Hateful Bots? Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media" by Nuha Albadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for analysis. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in understanding their relevance.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or data collection methods, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used. In this paper, the authors mention a dataset consisting of **6,000 Arabic tweets** collected in November 2017, annotated for religious hate speech. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference any additional datasets or provide further details about the datasets used in their experiments. For instance, they mention a sample of **450 accounts** that were manually labeled for bot-like behavior, which is another important dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their previous work for the hate speech dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The full citation for the hate speech dataset is:
> Nuha Albadi, Maram Kurdi, and Shivakant Mishra. *Are they Our Brothers? Analysis and Detection of Religious Hate Speech in the Arabic Twittersphere*. In 2018 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM), pages 69â€“76, 2018. https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2018.8508247

For the dataset of manually labeled accounts, the citation is:
> Nuha Albadi, Maram Kurdi, and Shivakant Mishra. *Investigating the effect of combining GRU neural networks with handcrafted features for religious hatred detection on Arabic Twitter space*. Social Network Analysis and Mining 9, 1 (2019), 41. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13278-019-0587-5

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
