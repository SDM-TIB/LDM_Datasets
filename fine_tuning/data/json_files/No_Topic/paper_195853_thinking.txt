To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Case-Based Subgoaling in Real-Time Heuristic Search for Video Game Pathfinding" by Vadim Bulitko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 8) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **maps modeled after game levels from Counter-Strike: Source** and describe the characteristics of these maps in detail. They also mention that they developed a new set of maps with millions of vacant cells, which indicates that these maps serve as the datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. In this case, the datasets are not traditional datasets with authors and publication years but rather custom maps created for the study. Therefore, I will note the details provided in the paper about these maps.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Counter-Strike: Source Maps**: The authors developed a set of maps modeled after game levels from Counter-Strike: Source, which contain between nine and thirteen million vacant cells. This dataset is significant for evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm.

2. **Baldur's Gate and WarCraft III Maps**: The paper mentions that previous works commonly used maps from these games, but the focus of this research is on the new maps developed from Counter-Strike: Source.

Since the datasets are not formally published in the same way as traditional datasets, I will create a citation that reflects the context in which they were used in the research paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the context and any relevant details that would help in understanding the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the citations are clear and complete.
