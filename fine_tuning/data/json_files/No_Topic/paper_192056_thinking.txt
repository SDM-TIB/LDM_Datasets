To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved 8-point Approximate DCT for Image and Video Compression Requiring Only 14 Additions" by Uma Sadhvi Potluri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it may hint at their existence.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** closely. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check there as well, as authors often refer back to the datasets when discussing their findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "USC-SIPI Image Database," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references to ensure I have the complete information.

Once I have gathered all the necessary details, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
