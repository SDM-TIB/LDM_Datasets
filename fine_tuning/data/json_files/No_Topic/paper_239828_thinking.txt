To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novelty Search Employed into the Development of Cancer Treatment Simulations" by Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on optimizing a drug delivery system using the PhysiCell simulator, which suggests that there may be datasets related to simulations or experimental results.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the PhysiCell simulator and its applications, but I need to look for explicit references to datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the optimization process and mention the use of the PhysiCell simulator. I will look for any details about the data generated during the simulations, including parameters and configurations that may constitute a dataset.

I will also check the **results section** for any tables or figures that summarize data outputs from the simulations. If the authors present results in a structured format, this could indicate the presence of a dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned in the paper. The PhysiCell simulator is referenced multiple times, and I will ensure to include its citation as it is central to the study.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Now, I will proceed to extract the relevant datasets and their citations.
