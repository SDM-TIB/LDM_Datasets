To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paper2vec: Citation-Context Based Document Distributed Representation for Scholar Recommendation" by Han Tian and Hankz Hankui Zhuo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the context of citation analysis and mentions the need for datasets in evaluating recommender systems.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMCOS)**: This dataset consists of approximately 860,000 documents from biomedicine and life sciences, maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. It is used for extracting citation relations and constructing a database for the study.

2. **TREC Genomics Collection**: This dataset includes around 160,000 Open Access biomedical full-text articles, used in the Genomics track of the TREC conference 2006. It also serves as a source for citation relations.

The authors provide details about the number of documents and references collected from both datasets, confirming their significance in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PubMed Central Open Access Subset (PMCOS)**, the citation is:
  > U.S. National Library of Medicine. *PubMed Central Open Access Subset*. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/

- For **TREC Genomics Collection**, the citation is:
  > TREC. *TREC Genomics Track*. Available at: https://trec.nist.gov/data/genomics/

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
