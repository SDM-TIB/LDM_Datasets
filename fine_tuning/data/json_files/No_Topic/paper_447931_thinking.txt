To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Low Rank Matrix Learning under Partial Observations: Mixed-Projection ADMM" by Dimitris Bertsimas and Nicholas Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used for numerical experiments or evaluations. For example, if the authors mention using the Netflix Prize dataset or any synthetic datasets, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For instance, if the paper references the Netflix Prize dataset, I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset and include that citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
