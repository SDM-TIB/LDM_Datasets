To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Median regression with differential privacy" by E Chen, Ying Miao, and Yu Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses median regression and differential privacy but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of differential privacy without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and algorithms sections** (specifically sections 3 and 4) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments or simulations. In these sections, the authors describe three algorithms for median regression but do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are implied through the cited works. The references include various papers on differential privacy and regression techniques, but they do not directly mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets for their experiments or simulations. Instead, they focus on theoretical developments and algorithmic approaches without empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.

In summary, I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, but it seems that the authors did not include any specific datasets in their research.
