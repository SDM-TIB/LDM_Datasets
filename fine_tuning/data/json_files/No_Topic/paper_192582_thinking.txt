To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Impossibility of Convex Inference in Human Computation" by Nihar B. Shah and Dengyong Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract primarily discusses the theoretical aspects of convex inference in human computation, so I will pay close attention to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various algorithms and models related to crowdsourcing but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **problem setting and axiomatization sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of their examples or models.

As I progress through the paper, I will look for any **examples or case studies** that might involve datasets. The authors discuss existing models for crowdsourcing and provide examples, such as the Dawid-Skene model and others, but they do not specify datasets used in their experiments or analyses.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works include datasets that might be relevant to the discussion in this paper. The references include various studies on crowdsourcing and human computation, but I will need to verify if any of these studies provide datasets that can be cited.

After reviewing the references, I will compile the information I have gathered. If I find any datasets mentioned in the references, I will ensure to write down their full citations. If no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper or its references, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets identified, as this is crucial for proper documentation and future reference.
