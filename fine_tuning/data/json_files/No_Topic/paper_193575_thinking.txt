To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fastfood: Approximate Kernel Expansions in Loglinear Time" by Quoc Viet Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the Fastfood method and its advantages but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This indicates that CIFAR-10 is one of the datasets used in their experiments.

Then, I will look into the **experiments section** to find more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. They also mention that the dataset has images of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets mentioned.
2. Look into the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

The only dataset identified is:
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels.

The full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
