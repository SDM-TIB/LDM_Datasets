To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Remote Contextual Bandits" by Francesco Pase et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses a remote contextual multi-armed bandit problem but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The paper may describe experiments that utilize specific datasets, which could be crucial for understanding the context of the research.

I will also check the **numerical results section** for any datasets used in the experiments. This section often provides insights into the data used for testing the proposed methods.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will look for the original sources of the datasets mentioned in the text. This may involve searching for the datasets online or checking related literature.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
