To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Siamese Networks with Bayesian non-Parametrics for Video Object Tracking" by Anthony D. Rhodes and Manan Goel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a novel algorithm for video object tracking but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions that the algorithm was tested using a subset of the VOT14 and VOT16 datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they tested their algorithm using a subset of the **VOT14** and **VOT16** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Now, I need to gather full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. I will look for the entries that correspond to the VOT datasets. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

- For **VOT14 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, Matej et al. 2015. The Visual Object Tracking VOT2014 Challenge Results. In ECCV 2014 Workshops.

- For **VOT16 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matej Kristan et al. 2017. The Visual Object Tracking VOT2016 Challenge Results. In ECCV 2017 Workshops.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **VOT14 Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating visual object tracking algorithms, specifically designed for the VOT2014 challenge.
2. **VOT16 Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating visual object tracking algorithms, specifically designed for the VOT2016 challenge.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.
