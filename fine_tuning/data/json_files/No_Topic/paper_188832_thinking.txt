To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simultaneous Clustering and Model Selection for Multinomial Distribution: A Comparative Study" by Md. Abul Hasnat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussion)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two types of datasets:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors explain that they generated discrete count vectors from Multinomial Mixture models (MMs) with different configurations. They specify that they created 100 sets of data for each configuration, but they do not provide a formal citation since these datasets are synthetic.

2. **Real Datasets**: The authors list eight text datasets used in their experiments, which are crucial for my extraction. They provide a table (Table 1) that includes the names of the datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of features, samples, and clusters. The datasets mentioned are:
   - **NG20**: 20 Newsgroups
   - **Classic**: ACM/CISI/CRANFIELD/MEDLINE
   - **Ohscal**: OHSUMED
   - **K1b**: WebACE
   - **Hitech**: SJM-TREC
   - **Reviews**: SJM-TREC
   - **Sports**: SJM-TREC
   - **La12**: LAT-TREC

I will now look for the **References section** to find full citations for the real datasets. The authors refer to a previous work ([20]) for additional details about the construction of these datasets. Therefore, I will extract the citation for that reference:

- For the real datasets, the citation is:
  > Zhong, S., & Ghosh, J. (2005). Generative model-based document clustering: a comparative study. *Knowledge and Information Systems*, 8(3), 374â€“384.

Since the simulated datasets do not have a formal citation, I will note that they are generated by the authors and do not require a citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the real datasets and note the nature of the simulated datasets. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper.
