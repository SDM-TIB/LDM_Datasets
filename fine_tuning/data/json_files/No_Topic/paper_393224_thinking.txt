To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Constraint-based Recommender System via RDF Knowledge Graphs" by Ngoc Luyen Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of RDF knowledge graphs in the context of a recommender system for vehicle purchases/sales, which suggests that there may be datasets related to vehicles or user preferences.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. In this section, they mention using an RDF knowledge graph consisting of **5537 individuals of vehicle descriptions and 367 user preferences**, which indicates that these are the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The paper cites previous works that may have contributed to the datasets or methodologies used. However, it appears that the datasets themselves (the RDF knowledge graph of vehicle descriptions and user preferences) are not attributed to external sources but are rather constructed by the authors based on their own research.

Since the paper does not provide specific external citations for the datasets, I will note the datasets as follows:

1. **RDF Knowledge Graph of Vehicle Descriptions**: This dataset consists of 5537 individuals representing various vehicle descriptions, organized as RDF triples.

2. **User Preferences Dataset**: This dataset includes 367 user preferences related to vehicle purchases, also structured as RDF triples.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of these datasets:

- For the RDF Knowledge Graph of Vehicle Descriptions and User Preferences, the citation is:
  > Ngoc Luyen Le, Marie-Hélène Abel, and Philippe Gouspillou. *A Constraint-based Recommender System via RDF Knowledge Graphs*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, pages 126–136, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
