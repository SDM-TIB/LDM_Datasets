To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Multiple Dermoscopic Photographs of One Lesion Improves Melanoma Classification via Deep Learning: A Prognostic Diagnostic Accuracy Study" by Achim Hekler et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention a dataset referred to as **SCP2**, which consists of dermoscopic images collected from eight university hospitals in Germany. They specify that this dataset includes six images per lesion, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also refer to two publicly available datasets used for training their classifier: **HAM10000** and **BCN20000**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and the number of images they contain.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For **HAM10000**:
   > Tschandl P, Rosendahl C, Kittler H. *The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions*. Sci Data. 2018;5(1):180161. doi:10.1038/sdata.2018.161

2. For **BCN20000**:
   > Combalia M, Codella NCF, Rotemberg V, et al. *BCN20000: Dermoscopic Lesions in the Wild*. Published online August 30, 2019. doi:10.48550/arXiv.1908.02288

3. For **SCP2**: Since SCP2 is a dataset created for this study, it may not have a formal citation like the others. However, I will note its description and context as provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I provide complete and accurate references for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study and facilitate further research or validation by others.
