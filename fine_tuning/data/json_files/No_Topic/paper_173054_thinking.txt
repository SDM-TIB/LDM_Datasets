To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Top-Rank Enhanced Listwise Optimization for Statistical Machine Translation" by Huadong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors discuss the data and preparation. Here, they mention using a large-scale Chinese-English translation task and provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used, including their names, purposes, and statistics.

In Table 1, I find the following datasets:

1. **LDC Corpora**: This dataset consists of 8.2 million sentence pairs used for training the translation model.
2. **Gigaword Corpus**: This monolingual dataset contains 14,684,074 sentences used for training the language model.
3. **NIST MT03**: This dataset is used as the development set and contains 919 sentences.
4. **NIST MT02**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 878 sentences.
5. **NIST MT04**: This dataset is also used for testing and contains 1,788 sentences.
6. **NIST MT05**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 1,082 sentences.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The LDC corpora are typically referenced in a standard format, and I will ensure to include the correct citation format for each dataset.

For the **LDC Corpora**, the citation is:
> LDC2002E18, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T10, LDC2004E12, LDC2007T09. Linguistic Data Consortium.

For the **Gigaword Corpus**, the citation is:
> Graff, P. (2005). *The English Gigaword Corpus, LDC2003T05*. Linguistic Data Consortium.

For the **NIST MT03**, **MT02**, **MT04**, and **MT05**, the citations are:
> NIST. (2003). *NIST Machine Translation Evaluation, MT03*. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
> NIST. (2002). *NIST Machine Translation Evaluation, MT02*. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
> NIST. (2004). *NIST Machine Translation Evaluation, MT04*. National Institute of Standards and Technology.
> NIST. (2005). *NIST Machine Translation Evaluation, MT05*. National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
