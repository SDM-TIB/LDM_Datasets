To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TIVE: A Toolbox for Identifying Video Instance Segmentation Errors" by Wenhe Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the introduction of TIVE and its purpose but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions the Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) task and references existing benchmarks, which may lead to specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors discuss their experiments and the metrics used, but I need to confirm if they mention specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to the **YouTube-VIS** dataset as the primary benchmark for their experiments. They mention that their experiments are conducted on the YouTube-VIS 2021 mini-train and mini-val subsets, which are derived from the larger YouTube-VIS dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YouTube-VIS dataset. The citation for the YouTube-VIS dataset is as follows:
> Xu, N., Yang, L., Fan, Y., Yue, D., Liang, Y., Yang, J., & Huang, T. (2018). YouTube-VOS: A large-scale video object segmentation benchmark. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.03327*.

Since the authors also mention using a mini-train and mini-val subset of the YouTube-VIS dataset, I will note that these subsets are derived from the original dataset but do not require separate citations as they are part of the same dataset.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset from the paper:

1. **YouTube-VIS Dataset**: This dataset is used for video instance segmentation tasks and is referenced throughout the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with its full citation for further processing.
