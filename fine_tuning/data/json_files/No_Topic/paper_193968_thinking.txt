To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-Rater Agreement Study on Readability Assessment in Bengali" by Shanta Phani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a readability-annotated ground truth dataset in Bengali was obtained as a byproduct of the study, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the process of collecting a corpus of 30 Bengali text passages. This section provides details about the dataset, including the authors of the texts and the number of passages collected from each author. The authors are:

1. **Rabindranath Tagore**
2. **Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay**
3. **Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay**
4. **Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay**

The paper states that the dataset consists of 30 passages, which were annotated by seven independent annotators using a 1-7 readability rating scale. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors emphasize that this is the first inter-rater agreement study on readability assessment in Bengali and that they plan to release the dataset for future research. This confirms the significance of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The dataset is a human-annotated gold standard dataset for readability evaluation in Bengali, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it since it is a new dataset created by the authors. However, I can reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Shanta Phani, Shibamouli Lahiri, and Arindam Biswas. *Inter-Rater Agreement Study on Readability Assessment in Bengali*. International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC), Vol. 3, No. 3, June 2014.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

- **Dataset Name**: Bengali Readability Annotated Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 30 Bengali text passages annotated for readability by seven independent annotators using a 1-7 rating scale.
- **Authors of the Dataset**: Shanta Phani, Shibamouli Lahiri, Arindam Biswas
- **Full Citation**: Shanta Phani, Shibamouli Lahiri, and Arindam Biswas. *Inter-Rater Agreement Study on Readability Assessment in Bengali*. International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC), Vol. 3, No. 3, June 2014.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and future reference.
