To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coverage Analysis for 3D Terahertz Communication Systems with Blockage and Directional Antennas" by Akram Shafie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the data used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as a **Datasets** or **Data Collection** section. In this paper, there may not be a dedicated section for datasets, so I will need to identify any datasets mentioned throughout the text, particularly in the methodology and results sections.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced. For example, if the authors mention using simulation data or real-world data collected from experiments, I will document these references carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for simulations or comparisons, I will ensure to find the original source of that dataset. If they mention datasets from previous studies, I will look up those studies to get the correct citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents, and the citation formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, making it easy for others to understand the datasets used in the research and to locate them for further study or verification.
