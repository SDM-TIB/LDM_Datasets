To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BoxTeacher: Exploring High-Quality Pseudo Labels for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation" by Tianheng Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve significant results on the **COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention three datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 80 categories and 110,000 images for training, 5,000 images for validation, and 20,000 images for testing. This dataset is widely used for instance segmentation tasks.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is aimed at perception in driving scenes and consists of 5,000 high-resolution street-view images, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. The authors note that it has 8 classes with fine annotations.

3. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**: This dataset includes 20 categories and consists of 10,582 images for training and 1,449 images for validation. It is another well-known dataset in the field of object detection and segmentation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*.

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John M. Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
