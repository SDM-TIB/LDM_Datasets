To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Turning Flowchart into Dialog: Augmenting Flowchart-grounded Troubleshooting Dialogs via Synthetic Data Generation" by Haolan Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the **FloDial dataset**, which is a troubleshooting dialogue corpus, indicating that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **section 3.1 (Setup)**, they state that they use the **FloDial dataset** for their experiments, which contains 1,789 dialogues grounded on ten individual flowcharts from two main domains: vehicle and laptop. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's size and its purpose.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the dataset. In **A.2 (Details about FloDial Dataset)**, the authors provide further information about the dataset, including the number of dialogues and paths for each sub-problem within the vehicle and laptop domains. This reinforces the importance of the FloDial dataset in their research.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **FloDial dataset** in the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Raghu, D., Agarwal, S., Joshi, S., & Mausam. (2021). End-to-end learning of flowchart grounded task-oriented dialogs. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 4348â€“4366). Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information about the **FloDial dataset** into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for the FloDial dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
