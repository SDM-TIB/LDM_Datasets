To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-based Multi-agent Policy Optimization with Adaptive Opponent-wise Rollouts" by Weinan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical validation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using environments for their experiments, but they do not explicitly list any datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets). Instead, they refer to environments such as "Multi-Agent Particle Environment" and specific tasks like "Cooperative communication," "Cooperative navigation," and "Predator-prey." These environments are often used in reinforcement learning research but may not be datasets in the conventional sense.

Since the paper does not provide traditional datasets with citations, I will note the environments and tasks as they are described in the paper. For example:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment**: This is a common benchmark for multi-agent reinforcement learning, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it. However, it is widely recognized in the field.

2. **Cooperative communication**: This task is described in the context of the experiments but does not have a separate dataset citation.

3. **Cooperative navigation**: Similar to the above, this task is part of the experimental setup without a specific dataset citation.

4. **Predator-prey**: This is another task mentioned in the experiments, again without a specific dataset citation.

After identifying these environments and tasks, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the environments or tasks have associated papers that could serve as citations. For instance, the Multi-Agent Particle Environment is often associated with the work by Lowe et al. (2017), which I will include as a citation.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that I provide the relevant citations for the environments and tasks mentioned in the paper.

In summary, while the paper does not explicitly list traditional datasets, I will document the environments and tasks used in the experiments along with their relevant citations where applicable.
