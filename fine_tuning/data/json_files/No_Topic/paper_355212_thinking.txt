To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A challenge-based survey of e-recruitment recommendation systems" by Yoosof Mashayekhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention any datasets used or referenced. In this case, the abstract discusses the importance of e-recruitment recommendation systems but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology and literature review sections**. These sections typically detail the approaches taken by the authors and may reference datasets used in previous studies. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize datasets or studies, as they often contain valuable information.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any mentions of datasets. The authors may discuss the datasets used for their analysis or evaluation, which is crucial for understanding the context of their findings.

After reviewing these sections, I will specifically look for a **dedicated section on datasets**. If the paper includes a section that explicitly lists datasets, I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned. 

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:
1. **CareerBuilder 2012 dataset**: This dataset is available on Kaggle and is used for job recommendations.
2. **Zhilian dataset**: This dataset is from a Chinese e-recruitment platform and is also referenced in the context of job recommendations.

Next, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

The full citations I found are:
- For the **CareerBuilder 2012 dataset**:
  > CareerBuilder. (2012). *CareerBuilder 2012 dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/job-recommendation

- For the **Zhilian dataset**:
  > Zhilian. (n.d.). *Zhilian dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.zhaopin.com

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will ensure that the information is readily accessible for future reference or analysis.
