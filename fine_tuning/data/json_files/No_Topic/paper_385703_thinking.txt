To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Banana: Banach Fixed-Point Network for Pointcloud Segmentation with Inter-Part Equivariance" by Congyue Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on the **Shape2Motion dataset** for articulated-object part segmentation. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) and the **conclusion** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced or discussed. However, the primary dataset appears to be the Shape2Motion dataset.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Shape2Motion dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Shape2Motion dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaogang Wang, Bin Zhou, Yahao Shi, Xiaowu Chen, Qinping Zhao, and Kai Xu. *Shape2motion: Joint analysis of motion parts and attributes from 3D shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8876â€“8884, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Shape2Motion dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
