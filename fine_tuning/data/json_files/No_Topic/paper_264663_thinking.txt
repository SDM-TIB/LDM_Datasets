To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Whole-brain calcium imaging with cellular resolution in freely behaving C. elegans" by Jeffrey P. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or alluded to. The abstract discusses the development of a new instrument for recording neuronal activity in C. elegans, which suggests that there may be associated datasets related to neuronal activity and behavior.

Next, I will examine the **results** and **methods** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted and the datasets generated. In the results section, the authors describe the imaging of neuronal activity and behavior, indicating that they likely collected data on calcium transients from neurons and the corresponding behaviors of the worms.

I will also look for any specific mentions of datasets in the **discussion** section, where the authors might reference previous studies or datasets that their work builds upon or compares against.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the use of a specific strain of C. elegans that expresses the calcium indicator GCaMP6s and a nuclear-localized RFP. This suggests that the dataset includes recordings of neuronal activity from these genetically modified worms.

Next, I will check the **references** section to find full citations for any datasets or related studies mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to various studies that have utilized calcium imaging techniques and specific strains of C. elegans, which may provide context for the datasets they generated.

For example, the paper cites the following relevant studies:

1. **GCaMP6s strain**: 
   > Tsai-Wen Chen et al. "Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity." *Nature*, 499(7458):295–300, July 2013.

2. **WormBase Virtual Worm Project**: 
   > WormBase - virtual worm project dataset.

3. **Previous calcium imaging studies**: 
   > J. G. White et al. "The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans." *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences*, 314(1165):1–340, November 1986.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include details such as the type of data collected (e.g., calcium imaging data, behavioral data), the number of neurons recorded, and any relevant experimental conditions.

Finally, I will ensure that all citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
