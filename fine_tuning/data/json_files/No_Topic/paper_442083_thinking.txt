To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Context of Metrology" by Tameem Adel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine **Section 2.3 (Good practice in training set preparation for marine navigation systems)**, as it appears to discuss the preparation of datasets for machine learning applications in marine navigation. This section is likely to contain specific details about datasets used or recommended for training machine learning models.

In this section, the authors mention the need for datasets that include domain images, bounding boxes, and object segmentation. However, they do not specify any particular datasets by name. I will also check if there are any references to datasets in the **References section** that might provide additional context or specific datasets used in their research.

I will also look for any examples or case studies mentioned in the paper that might reference specific datasets. For instance, if the authors discuss the use of existing datasets for training machine learning models, I will note those down.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**. If a dataset is referenced in the context of a specific study or application, I will include that citation as well.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) dataset, I will find the appropriate citation for it:
- For the VOC dataset, the citation is:
  > PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2007 (VOC2007) Annotation Guidelines. http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/guidelines.html. Accessed: 30-06-2023.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets discussed in the paper and provide proper attribution.
