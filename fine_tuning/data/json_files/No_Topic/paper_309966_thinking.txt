To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jasmine: a New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime" by Jan Klein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the need for realistic evaluation datasets in cybersecurity, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **NSL-KDD Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the most commonly used for evaluating intrusion detection methods. It was developed by Tavallaee et al. in 2009 and consists of a train set and a test set with specific characteristics.

2. **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**: This dataset was constructed by Moustafa et al. in 2015 and is designed to address some limitations of the NSL-KDD dataset. It contains a mix of realistic benign network behaviors and synthetic malicious connections.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their method using these datasets, confirming their relevance and importance in the context of their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NSL-KDD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Tavallaee, E. Bagheri, W. Lu, A. A. Ghorbani. *A detailed analysis of the kdd cup 99 data set*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications, pages 1–6, 2009.

- For the **UNSW-NB15 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Moustafa, J. Slay. *UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems (UNSW-NB15 network data set)*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Military Communications and Information Systems Conference (MilCIS), pages 1–6, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
