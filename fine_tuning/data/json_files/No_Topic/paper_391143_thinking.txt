To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Principal Component Analysis and Hidden Markov Model for Forecasting Stock Returns" by Eugene W. Park, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses data for stock returns from companies listed in the S&P 500 index, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation section** where the author discusses the data used for training the model. Here, the author specifies that the dataset consists of weekly returns for companies listed in the S&P 500, starting from July 23, 2004, and spanning to July 8, 2016. This gives me a clear indication of the dataset's time frame and context.

In the **model training section**, the author mentions that they ensured the dataset included returns data for at least 400 companies listed in the S&P 500 index for each time period. This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's size and composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset is derived from publicly available stock prices and does not have a specific citation like a traditional dataset, I will note that the data was obtained from finance.yahoo.com and the list of S&P 500 companies from Wikipedia.

Based on this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **S&P 500 Weekly Returns Dataset**: This dataset includes weekly return data for companies listed in the S&P 500 index, covering the period from July 23, 2004, to July 8, 2016. The dataset consists of returns for at least 400 companies, ensuring a robust analysis.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note the sources from which the data was obtained:

- Data was obtained from finance.yahoo.com.
- List of S&P 500 companies obtained from Wikipedia.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its source, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
