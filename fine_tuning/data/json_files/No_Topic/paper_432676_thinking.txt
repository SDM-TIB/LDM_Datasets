To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Machine Learning-Based Error Mitigation Approach for Reliable Software Development on IBMâ€™s Quantum Computers" by Asmar Muqeet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on eight quantum computers and their corresponding noisy simulators, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, I will focus on identifying any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MQT benchmark** for their experiments. This benchmark consists of a diverse set of quantum circuits tailored for various quantum computers, categorized into learning-level and application-level circuits. The paper specifies that they selected circuits from both categories for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MQT benchmark. The citation is as follows:
> N. Quetschlich, L. Burgholzer, and R. Wille. *MQT Bench: Benchmarking software and design automation tools for quantum computing*. Quantum, 2023. MQT Bench is available at https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/mqtbench/.

Additionally, the paper mentions that they executed circuits on eight IBM quantum computers, which are publicly accessible through the IBM Quantum Cloud platform. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather platforms for executing quantum circuits.

In summary, the primary dataset extracted from the paper is the **MQT benchmark**, which is used for evaluating the proposed method. The full citation for this dataset is crucial for proper documentation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the MQT benchmark, ensuring to include the full citation as required.
