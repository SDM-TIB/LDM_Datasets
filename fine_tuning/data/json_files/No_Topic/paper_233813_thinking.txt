To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing Impurity Partition Under Constraints" by Thuan Nguyen and Thinh Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources that the authors may have used in their experiments or analyses.

Next, I will check the **methodology** or **problem formulation** sections, as these often detail the datasets used for the experiments. In this paper, the authors discuss the optimization problem and the methods they propose, but I need to identify if they reference any specific datasets or data sources.

I will also review the **experiments** section, if available, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets they used to validate their methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying any datasets mentioned in the paper, I will then consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to ensure that I provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset used in the research.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will verify the citations against existing literature to ensure accuracy. For example, if they mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look up the original paper that introduced it to provide the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Review the methodology/problem formulation and experiments sections for specific datasets.
3. Check the References section for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring accuracy in citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
