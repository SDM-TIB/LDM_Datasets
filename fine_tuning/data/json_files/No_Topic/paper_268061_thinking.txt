To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blood Vessel Tortuosity Selects against Evolution of Aggressive Tumor Cells in Confined Tissue Environments: a Modeling Approach" by András Szabó and Roeland M. H. Merks, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for simulations or experiments. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors reference, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will check for any figures or tables that summarize data derived from these datasets. This may provide additional context or confirm the datasets mentioned earlier.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

As I go through these sections, I will take note of the following datasets:

1. **CompuCell3D Simulation Data**: The authors mention that the simulations were run using the CompuCell3D framework. I will look for any specific datasets or parameters used in these simulations.

2. **Nutrient Concentration Data**: The paper discusses nutrient levels (glucose, oxygen, lactate) in the context of the simulations. I will check if there are specific datasets or sources for these concentrations.

3. **Cellular Parameters Data**: The authors describe various cellular parameters that were mutated during the simulations. I will look for any datasets that provide the initial values or ranges for these parameters.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **CompuCell3D**, I will cite the relevant documentation or publication that describes the framework.
- For **nutrient concentration data**, I will find the original studies or databases that provided this information.
- For **cellular parameters**, I will look for any references that detail the experimental or theoretical basis for these parameters.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is properly cited and described, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
