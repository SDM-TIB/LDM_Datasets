To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Summary of the ALQAC 2021 Competition" by Nguyen Ha Thanh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the competition involves processing legal documents in Vietnamese and Thai, which suggests that datasets related to these languages are used.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in the competition. Here, they mention that the legal data consists of Vietnamese and Thai legal documents, specifically formatted for the tasks of legal text information retrieval, entailment, and question answering. This section provides crucial details about the nature of the datasets.

The paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations directly in the dataset section. Therefore, I will look for any references to previous works or datasets in the **References section** that might be relevant to the datasets used in ALQAC 2021. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works that may relate to the datasets used:

1. **COLIEE 2021**: This reference discusses a competition on legal information extraction/entailment, which may provide context for the datasets used in ALQAC 2021. The citation is:
   > Rabelo Juliano, Goebel Randy, Kano Yoshinobu, Kim Mi-Young, Yoshioka Masaharu, and Satoh Ken. *Summary of the competition on legal information extraction/entailment (COLIEE) 2021*. Proceedings of the COLIEE Workshop in ICAIL, 2021.

2. **VNLawBERT**: This reference discusses a Vietnamese legal answer selection approach using a BERT language model, which may indicate the dataset used for training. The citation is:
   > Chieu-Nguyen Chau, Truong-Son Nguyen, and Le-Minh Nguyen. *Vn-lawbert: A vietnamese legal answer selection approach using bert language model*. In 2020 7th NAFOSTED Conference on Information and Computer Science (NICS), pages 298–301. IEEE, 2020.

3. **PhoBERT**: This reference discusses pre-trained language models for Vietnamese, which could be relevant to the datasets used in the competition. The citation is:
   > Dat Quoc Nguyen and Anh Tuan Nguyen. *PhoBERT: Pre-trained language models for Vietnamese*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 1037–1042. Association for Computational Linguistics, November 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the ALQAC 2021 competition, along with their relevant citations for further reference.
