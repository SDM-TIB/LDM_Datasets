To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Malware Analysis with Symbolic Execution and Graph Kernel" by Charles-Henry Bertrand Van Ouytsel and Axel Legay, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of symbolic execution and machine learning for malware classification, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention a dataset composed of **1874 malware samples divided into 15 families** and **150 cleanware samples**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **table provided in the experiments section** (Table 1) for the exact composition of the dataset, which lists the number of samples for each malware family. This detailed breakdown is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references several sources, including:

1. **MalwareBazaar**: This is a source from which some malware samples were obtained. The citation is:
   > MalwareBazaar by abuse.ch, fighting malware and botnets. https://bazaar.abuse.ch/, accessed: 2021-10-29.

2. **AVClass**: This tool was used for labeling malware samples. The citation is:
   > Sebasti´an, M., Rivera, R., Kotzias, P., Caballero, J.: AVClass: A tool for massive malware labeling. In: International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses. pp. 230–253. Springer (2016).

3. **VirusTotal**: The paper mentions using VirusTotal reports for labeling. The citation is:
   > VirusTotal. https://www.virustotal.com, accessed: 2021-10-29.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
