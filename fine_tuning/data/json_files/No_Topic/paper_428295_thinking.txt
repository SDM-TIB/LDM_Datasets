To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving cross-domain brain tissue segmentation in fetal MRI with synthetic data" by Vladyslav Zalevskyi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the study's objectives and the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions a "120-subject cross-domain dataset" and a "40 subjects acquired using low-field (0.55T) MRI," indicating that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three distinct datasets:

1. **FeTA dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MICCAI 2022 FETA challenge and consists of 80 subjects with various tissue labels annotated by experts. The ethical approval for this dataset is also noted.

2. **Clinical 1.5T dataset**: This proprietary dataset, referred to as CHUV, contains 40 subjects and follows the FeTA protocol for manual annotations. The authors provide details about the ethical approval for using this dataset.

3. **Clinical 0.55T dataset**: This dataset includes 40 neurotypical cases acquired on a low-field MRI scanner from Kings College London. The authors note that there are no available manual segmentations for this dataset, but it has been ethically approved for sharing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **FeTA dataset**, the citation is:
  > K. Payette et al., “An automatic multi-tissue human fetal brain segmentation benchmark using the fetal tissue annotation dataset,” *Scientific Data*, vol. 8, no. 1, 2021.

- For the **Clinical 1.5T dataset (CHUV)**, the citation is:
  > K. Payette et al., “Multi-center fetal brain tissue annotation (FeTA) challenge 2022 results,” *arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.09463*, 2024.

- For the **Clinical 0.55T dataset (KCL)**, while there is no specific citation provided in the references, I will note the ethical approval and the context of its use as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This will prepare me for creating structured entries for each dataset in the required format later on.
