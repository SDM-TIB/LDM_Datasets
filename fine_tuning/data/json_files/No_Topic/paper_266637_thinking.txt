To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pricing Variance Swaps in a Hybrid Model of Stochastic Volatility and Interest Rate with Regime-Switching" by Jiling Cao, Teh Raihana Nazirah Roslan, and Wenjun Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss the context and significance of their research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their methodology and numerical experiments in detail, which may include references to any datasets used for validation or testing. I will specifically check for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their parameters.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for simulations or comparisons. The authors might describe the parameters and settings for their numerical experiments, which could indicate the datasets they utilized.

After identifying any datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the "Heston-CIR model" or any specific financial datasets used for variance swaps, I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:

- For the Heston model, the citation might be:
  > S. L. Heston, "A closed-form solution for options with stochastic volatility with applications to bond and currency options," *Review of Financial Studies*, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 327-343, 1993.

- If they reference a dataset from a specific study or paper, I will extract that citation as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing clear pathways for further investigation.
