To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Network: An Efficient and Optimized Machine Learning Paradigm for Reducing Genome Sequencing Error" by Dr. Ferdinand Kartriku et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a deep learning approach to correct sequencing errors in a chosen dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various sequencing projects and the errors they introduce, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology section**, where they mention using the **NA12878 dataset** taken from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This is a crucial piece of information, as it identifies the dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the NA12878 dataset was indeed used for training and validation, which it is. The authors describe their approach and the performance metrics achieved using this dataset, reinforcing its significance in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the NA12878 dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset. I know from external knowledge that the NA12878 dataset is widely recognized in genomics, and I can provide a general citation for it:

- **NA12878 Dataset**: 
  > The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. "A map of human genome variation from population-scale sequencing." *Nature*, vol. 467, no. 7319, pp. 1061-1073, 2010.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **NA12878 Dataset**: This dataset is a well-known human genome sample used extensively in genomics research. It is part of the 1000 Genomes Project and serves as a reference for various sequencing studies.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
