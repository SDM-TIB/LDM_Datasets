To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Realistic 3D Non-Stationary Channel Model for UAV-to-Vehicle Communications Incorporating Fuselage Posture" by Boyu Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there may be a section that discusses the simulations or measurements conducted, which could include datasets used for validation or comparison.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference several previous studies and models, but they do not explicitly mention any new datasets they created or used. Instead, they refer to existing models and measurement campaigns. Therefore, I will focus on identifying these references to existing datasets.

I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or models mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to measurement campaigns or datasets from other studies, I will extract those citations.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. For the measurement campaign referenced in the paper:
   > M. Simunek, F. P. Fontán, and P. Pechac. "The UAV Low Elevation Propagation Channel in Urban Areas: Statistical Analysis and Time-Series Generator." *IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation*, vol. 61, no. 7, pp. 3850–3858, 2013.

2. For the 3GPP channel model:
   > 3GPP TR. 38.901, "Study on channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz," V16.1.0, Jan. 2020.

3. For the previous work on UAV communications:
   > Q. M. Zhu, Y. W. Wang, K. L. Jiang, X. M. Chen, W. Z. Zhong, and N. Ahmed. "3D Non-Stationary Geometry-Based Multi-Input Multi-Output Channel Model for UAV-Ground Communication Systems." *IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation*, vol. 13, no. 8, pp. 1104–1112, 2019.

Since the paper does not introduce new datasets but relies on existing ones, I will compile these references as the datasets used in the study.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
