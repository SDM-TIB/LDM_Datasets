To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning" by Yu Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on four benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Measure)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ShanghaiTech**: This dataset is described as a medium-scale dataset from fixed-angle street video surveillance, containing 437 videos, including 307 normal and 130 anomaly videos.

2. **UCF-Crime**: A large-scale anomaly detection dataset with 1,900 untrimmed videos from real-world street and indoor surveillance cameras, covering 13 classes of anomalies.

3. **XD-Violence**: A large-scale multi-scene anomaly detection dataset collected from various sources, including real-life movies and surveillance cameras, containing 4,754 untrimmed videos.

4. **UCSD-Peds**: A small-scale dataset combined from two sub-datasets, Ped1 and Ped2, with a total of 98 videos.

In the same section, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, such as the number of videos and the nature of the annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ShanghaiTech**, the citation is:

- For **XD-Violence**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into other systems.
