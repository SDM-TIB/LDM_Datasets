To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mixtures of Spherical Gaussians via Fourier Analysis" by Somnath Chakraborty and Hariharan Narayanan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically check for any references to datasets used for training or testing the algorithms discussed. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "MNIST dataset" for training their models, I would look for the full citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to use the same datasets in their research.
