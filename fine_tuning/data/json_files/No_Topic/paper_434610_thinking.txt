To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Switching in Reset-Free RL" by Darshan Patil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include key datasets.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **EARL benchmark** for their evaluations. I will look for details about this benchmark in the experiments section, as it likely contains multiple datasets relevant to their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **EARL benchmark**, I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Tabletop Manipulation**: This dataset involves tasks where a robot manipulates objects on a tabletop. The specific citation for this dataset is:
   > Archit Sharma, Abhishek Gupta, Sergey Levine, Karol Hausman, and Chelsea Finn. *Autonomous Reinforcement Learning via Subgoal Curricula*. arXiv:2107.12931, 2021.

2. **Sawyer Door**: This dataset involves a robot learning to close a door. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tianhe Yu, Deirdre Quillen, Zhanpeng He, Ryan Julian, Karol Hausman, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine. *Meta-World: A Benchmark and Evaluation for Multi-Task and Meta Reinforcement Learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2019.

3. **Sawyer Peg**: This dataset involves a robot learning to insert a peg into a goal location. The citation is the same as for the Sawyer Door dataset.

4. **Minitaur**: This dataset involves a locomotion task where a Minitaur robot learns to navigate to a set of goal locations. The citation is:
   > Erwin Coumans and Yunfei Bai. *PyBullet, a Python module for physics simulation for games, robotics and machine learning*. 2016.

5. **4 Rooms**: This dataset is based on a gridworld environment where the agent needs to navigate through rooms. The citation is:
   > Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Lucas Willems, and Suman Pal. *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for Gymnasium*. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets are documented with proper citations for future reference.
