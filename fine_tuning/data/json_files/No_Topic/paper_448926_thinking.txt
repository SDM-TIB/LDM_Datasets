To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PrevPredMap: Exploring Temporal Modeling with Previous Predictions for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction" by Nan Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on the **nuScenes** and **Argoverse2** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about both datasets:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset includes 2D vectorized maps and consists of 1000 scenes, with 700 for training and 150 for validation. Each scene contains 20 seconds of 2Hz RGB images captured by 6 cameras.

2. **Argoverse2 Dataset**: This dataset offers 3D vectorized maps and consists of 1000 logs, with 700 allocated for training and 150 for validation. Each log comprises 15 seconds of 20Hz RGB images from 7 ring cameras.

The authors also mention adjustments made to the camera frame rates for the Argoverse2 dataset to align with their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

- For the **Argoverse2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Wilson, William Qi, Tanmay Agarwal, John Lambert, Jagjeet Singh, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Bowen Pan, Ratnesh Kumar, Andrew Hartnett, Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes, et al. *Argoverse 2: Next generation datasets for self-driving perception and forecasting*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.00493, 2023.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for any further processing or review.
