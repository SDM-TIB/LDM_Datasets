To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vertex Feature Encoding and Hierarchical Temporal Modeling in a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Action Recognition" by Konstantinos Papadopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **NTU RGB+D 60** and **NTU RGB+D 120** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 56,880 videos featuring 60 actions performed by 40 subjects, recorded from three different angles. The authors mention that they follow specific protocols for evaluation.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**: This dataset extends the NTU RGB+D 60 dataset by adding 60 additional action classes and 66 more subjects, with the same recording angles but more setups considered.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, and their descriptions confirm their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NTU RGB+D 60 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A Large Scale Dataset for 3D Human Activity Analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2016.

- For the **NTU RGB+D 120 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A Large-Scale Benchmark for 3D Human Activity Understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
