To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Bias and Fairness in NLP: Investigating the Impact of Bias and Debiasing in Language Models on the Fairness of Toxicity Detection" by Fatma Elsafoury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it mentions the use of a dataset for toxicity detection, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 4 (Toxicity Detection)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the **Civil Community Dataset**, which contains almost 2 million comments labeled as toxic or not, along with identity labels for the target of the sentences.

I will also check the **background and related work sections** for any references to other datasets that may have been used in previous studies or comparisons. However, the primary dataset of interest appears to be the Civil Community Dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on this dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Civil Community Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Borkan, Daniel, Lucas Dixon, Jeffrey Sorensen, Nithum Thain, and Lucy Vasserman. *Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification*. In WWW ’19: Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference, pages 491–500.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention other datasets like ToxiGen, SocialFrame, and HateXplain, but they clarify that these datasets were not suitable for their investigation due to various reasons.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Civil Community Dataset, as it is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the Civil Community Dataset, and its citation is as follows:
- **Civil Community Dataset**: 
  > Borkan, Daniel, Lucas Dixon, Jeffrey Sorensen, Nithum Thain, and Lucy Vasserman. *Nuanced metrics for measuring unintended bias with real data for text classification*. In WWW ’19: Companion Proceedings of The 2019 World Wide Web Conference, pages 491–500.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
