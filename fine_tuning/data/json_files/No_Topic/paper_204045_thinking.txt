To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Music Composition" by Eunjeong Stella Koh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a model for music composition and mentions comparisons with other neural networks, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, particularly the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Nottingham Dataset** for training their model. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and content.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. They specifically mention that the Nottingham Dataset is a collection of 1200 British and American folk tunes, which is crucial information for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Nottingham Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> "Nottingham database," available at http://ifdo.ca/~seymour/nottingham/nottingham.html.

Since this is a web resource, I will ensure to format it correctly in the citation.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as those used for comparison, like the **MelodyRNN model**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the Nottingham Dataset for its experiments.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
