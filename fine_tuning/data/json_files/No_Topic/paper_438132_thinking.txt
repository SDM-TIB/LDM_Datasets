To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking Small Birds by Detection Candidate Region Filtering and Detection History-aware Association" by Tingwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **NUBird2022 dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the **NUBird2022 dataset** as consisting of approximately 8 minutes of video footage featuring five Zebra finches, with specific details about the number of frames and resolution. This section confirms that the NUBird2022 dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NUBird2022 dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- **NUBird2022 Dataset**:
  > Shinji Sumitani, Reiji Suzuki, Takaya Arita, Kazuhiro Nakadai, and Hiroshi G Okuno. *Non-invasive monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of vocalizations among songbirds in a semi free-flight environment using robot audition techniques*. Birds, 2(2):158–172, 2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **NUBird2022 Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 8 minutes of video footage of five Zebra finches, with a total of 14,459 frames and a resolution of 4,096 × 2,048 pixels. The dataset is specifically designed for tracking small birds in a closed environment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
