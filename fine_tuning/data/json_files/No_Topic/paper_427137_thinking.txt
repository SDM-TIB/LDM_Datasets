To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SQ-LLaVA: Self-Questioning for Large Vision-Language Assistant" by Guohao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the use of visual instruction datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets. This is often where authors detail the datasets they used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the open-source visual instruction dataset provided by LLaVA and ShareGPT4V. I will note these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several datasets, including:

1. **COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for image captioning and object detection.
   - Citation: Chen, X., et al. (2015). *Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server*. arXiv:1504.00325.

2. **GQA Dataset**: A dataset for visual reasoning and question answering.
   - Citation: Hudson, A., & Manning, C. (2019). *GQA: A New Dataset for Real-World Visual Reasoning and Compositional Question Answering*. CVPR.

3. **VizWiz Dataset**: A dataset for visual question answering from blind people.
   - Citation: Gurari, D., et al. (2018). *VizWiz Grand Challenge: Answering Visual Questions from Blind People*. CVPR.

4. **TextVQA Dataset**: A dataset that requires models to recognize text in images.
   - Citation: Singh, A., et al. (2019). *Towards VQA Models That Can Read*. CVPR.

5. **Nocaps Dataset**: A dataset for novel object captioning.
   - Citation: Agrawal, H., et al. (2019). *Nocaps: Novel Object Captioning at Scale*. ICCV.

6. **Flickr30K Dataset**: A dataset for image captioning with 30,000 images.
   - Citation: Young, P., et al. (2014). *From Image Descriptions to Visual Denotations: New Similarity Metrics for Semantic Inference over Event Descriptions*. TACL.

7. **Conceptual Captions Dataset**: A dataset for automatic image captioning.
   - Citation: Sharma, P., et al. (2018). *Conceptual Captions: A Cleaned, Hypernymed, Image Alt-Text Dataset for Automatic Image Captioning*. ACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
