To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analytic calibration in Andreasen-Huge SABR model" by Konstantin Feldman, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** and subsequent sections where the author might describe the datasets used for testing or validation.

In the **introduction**, the author references the SABR model and its applications in the interest rate futures option market. However, there are no specific datasets mentioned yet. I will continue to the **methodology and results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the author discusses the application of the SABR model to the Eurodollar options market, specifically mentioning the use of quoted ATM and OTM option prices. However, there are no specific datasets named; instead, the author refers to market data that is typically available.

Next, I will check the **conclusion and references sections** to see if the author cites any datasets or provides references to datasets used in the analysis. The references primarily cite other research papers and articles related to the SABR model and its calibration, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets. The author uses market data from Eurodollar options, which is publicly available, but does not provide a formal dataset citation.

In conclusion, while I cannot extract specific datasets with full citations from this paper, I can note that the author utilizes market data from Eurodollar options for the analysis. If I were to document this, I would mention that the datasets are derived from market prices but do not have formal citations as they are not explicitly listed in the paper.

Overall, I will compile my findings into a structured format, noting the absence of specific dataset citations while acknowledging the use of market data in the analysis.
