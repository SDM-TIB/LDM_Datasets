To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Protein Function Prediction with Tail-GNNs" by Stefan Spalević et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract discusses the use of graph neural networks for protein function prediction, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (section 3), particularly **subsection 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using training sequences and functional annotations from **CAFA3**, a protein function prediction challenge. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of proteins, the structure of the Gene Ontology (GO), and the filtering criteria applied to the dataset.

The authors specify that they used the **Molecular Function Ontology (MFO)** from GO, which contains 11,113 terms, and they describe how they reduced the ontology to 123 nodes and 145 edges. They also mention that the final dataset contains 31,243 proteins with an average sequence length of 431 amino acids and an average of 7 functions per protein.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CAFA3 dataset. The authors cite the CAFA challenge paper, which is crucial for providing the complete reference for the dataset.

The citation for the CAFA3 dataset is:
> Zhou, N., Jiang, Y., Bergquist, T. R., Lee, A. J., Kacsoh, B. Z., Crocker, A. W., Lewis, K. A., Georghiou, G., Nguyen, H. N., Hamid, M. N., et al. *The CAFA challenge reports improved protein function prediction and new functional annotations for hundreds of genes through experimental screens*. Genome Biology, 20(1):1–23, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
