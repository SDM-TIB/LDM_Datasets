To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesis-Guided Feature Learning for Cross-Spectral Periocular Recognition" by Domenick Poster and Nasser Nasrabadi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark their approach on specific datasets, which suggests that I should find their names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the Hong Kong PolyU and Cross-Eyed datasets as benchmarks for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for understanding their research.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (IV)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **Hong Kong PolyU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12,540 images with a resolution of 640×480, featuring images from 209 subjects (15 samples of each eye). The training set includes the first 104 subjects and part of the 105th subject, while the remaining subjects are used for testing.

2. **Cross-Eyed Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,840 images from 120 subjects, with eight samples from each subject. The first 60 subjects are assigned to the training set, and the remaining 60 to the test set.

Both datasets are used for cross-spectral periocular recognition, and the authors provide specific details about the number of images, subjects, and the training/testing split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Hong Kong PolyU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. R. Nalla and A. Kumar. *Toward more accurate iris recognition using cross-spectral matching*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 26(1):208–221, 2016.

- For the **Cross-Eyed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Sequeira, L. Chen, P. Wild, J. Ferryman, F. Alonso-Fernandez, K. B. Raja, R. Raghavendra, C. Busch, and J. Bigun. *Cross-eyed-cross-spectral iris/periocular recognition database and competition*. In 2016 International Conference of the Biometrics Special Interest Group (BIOSIG), pages 1–5. IEEE, 2016.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
