To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Approximations for Euclidean k-means and k-median, via Nested Quasi-Independent Sets" by Vincent Cohen-Addad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract typically summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: I will look for sections explicitly discussing datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections often provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any specific details provided by the authors. This includes the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics or benchmarks associated with the datasets.

4. **Check References for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any notable features.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Review and Finalize**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before compiling it into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
