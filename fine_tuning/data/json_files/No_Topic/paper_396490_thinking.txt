To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Control of Cross-Directional Systems Using the Generalised Singular Value Decomposition" by Idris Kempf, Paul J. Goulart, and Stephen Duncan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Results)**, where the authors discuss the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors describe the experiments conducted at the Diamond Light Source, which likely involves specific datasets related to synchrotron radiation and control systems. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for validation or testing purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

For example, if the authors mention datasets like "Diamond Light Source Data" or "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find their full citations. If the datasets are not explicitly cited in the references, I will note down any relevant papers or sources mentioned in the text that could lead to the original dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
