To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is the Cost of Adding a Constraint in Linear Least Squares?" by Ramakrishna Kakarala and Jun Wei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and example sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the theory of constrained least squares and mentions a practical problem in color calibration, which suggests that there may be datasets related to color calibration.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors describe the calibration of a color correction matrix (CCM) using a color checker chart. They mention using a specific chart to measure RGB values, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

In the **example section (Section 4)**, the authors provide details about the experimental setup, including the use of a color checker chart. They mention that they used an image of a measured chart and provide a link to the image. This suggests that the dataset consists of RGB values from the color checker chart.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets used. In Table 1, the authors present fitting errors and CRLB values for different constraints, which implies that they have conducted experiments using specific datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the color checker chart and provides a link to it, which I will include in the citation.

The relevant datasets I have identified are:

1. **Color Checker Chart Dataset**: This dataset consists of RGB values measured from the color checker chart used for calibration. The authors refer to it in the context of their experiments.

The citation for the color checker chart is:
> "Color Checker chart," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorChecker, [Online; accessed 29-June-2021].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
