To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Operational Adversarial Examples for Reliable Deep Learning" by Xingyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and future work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of detecting adversarial examples (AEs) in deep learning, but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **context and motivation section** to see if any datasets are referenced. This section discusses the concept of operational adversarial examples but does not mention specific datasets.

Moving on to the **research objectives and methodology sections**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing. The authors mention synthesizing an operational dataset in RQ1, but they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset.

In the **future work section**, the authors outline their plans for developing a new deep learning testing tool, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might be cited indirectly through the works referenced. I will look for papers that may describe datasets relevant to the topic of adversarial examples or operational profiles.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several papers that may contain datasets:

1. **DeepXplore**: This paper discusses automated testing of deep learning systems and may reference datasets used in their experiments. The citation is:
   > K. Pei, Y. Cao, J. Yang, and S. Jana, “DeepXplore: Automated whitebox testing of Deep Learning systems,” in Proc. of the 26th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, ser. SOSP ’17. ACM, 2017, pp. 1–18.

2. **Generating Natural Adversarial Examples**: This paper may also provide insights into datasets used for generating adversarial examples. The citation is:
   > Z. Zhao, D. Dua, and S. Singh, “Generating natural adversarial examples,” in International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

3. **A Safety Framework for Critical Systems Utilizing Deep Neural Networks**: This paper might reference datasets relevant to safety in deep learning. The citation is:
   > X. Zhao, A. Banks, J. Sharp, V. Robu, D. Flynn, M. Fisher, and X. Huang, “A safety framework for critical systems utilising deep neural networks,” in SafeComp’20, ser. LNCS, vol. 12234, 2020, pp. 244–259.

Since the original paper does not provide specific datasets, I will note that the authors may have synthesized their operational dataset based on existing datasets or methodologies discussed in the referenced works.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring that I include the full citations for any datasets or relevant papers that may inform the context of the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets related to the study of operational adversarial examples in deep learning.
