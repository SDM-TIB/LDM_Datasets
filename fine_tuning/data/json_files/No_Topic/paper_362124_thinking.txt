To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Block Attention Active Feedback Codes" by Emre Ozfatura et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed BAAF codes but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets used. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "GBAF code" or "DeepCode," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for presentation or further processing.
