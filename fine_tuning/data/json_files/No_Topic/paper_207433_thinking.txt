To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hierarchical Contextual Attention-based GRU Network for Sequential Recommendation" by Qiang Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on "two real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Analysis)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset is described as being used for a clothing matching competition on the TianChi platform. It includes user historical behavior data for sequential recommendations, specifically for users who have made at least 30 purchases.

2. **Outbrain Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for click prediction on Kaggle. It consists of a sample version of page views log data, focusing on users who have more than 10 views.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics about these datasets, such as the number of users, items, feedbacks, average sequence length, and sparsity, which further confirms their relevance and details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Taobao Dataset**, the citation is:
  > TianChi. *Taobao Dataset for Clothing Matching Competition*. Available at: https://tianchi.shuju.aliyun.com/datalab/dataSet.htm?id=13.

- For the **Outbrain Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Outbrain. *Click Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the experiments conducted.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
