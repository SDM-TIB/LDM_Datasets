To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Interaction Training for Segmentation Editing Networks" by Gustav Bredell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a unique training strategy for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for segmentation editing, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for editing segmentations and reference various studies. However, I need to look for specific datasets that were used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the materials used. Here, they explicitly mention the **prostate dataset of the NCI-ISBI 2013 challenge**. This dataset consists of T2-weighted MRIs of the prostate and includes 60 patient volumes, with specific details about the segmentation tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the NCI-ISBI 2013 challenge dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For the **NCI-ISBI 2013 challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bloch, N., Madabhushi, A., Huisman, H., et al. *NCI-ISBI 2013 challenge: automated segmentation of prostate structures*. The Cancer Imaging Archive, 2015.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured manner, ensuring that I include all necessary information for clarity and completeness. This will prepare me for the final output, which will include the dataset entry ready for review or further processing.
