To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Networked Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits with Combinatorial Strategies" by Shaojie Tang and Yaqin Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or simulations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that might include datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** or **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for sections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Data Collection," "Datasets," or similar headings. If the authors describe any datasets, I will take note of their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results** section, I will check for any references to datasets used in the analysis or evaluation of the proposed methods. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger study or paper, I will ensure to cite the original source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology and experiments sections for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Check the results section for any additional dataset references.
4. Look up full citations in the references section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
