To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMBench: Is Your Multi-modal Model an All-around Player?" by Yuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark called MMBench, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in its construction or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of evaluating large vision-language models (VLMs) and mention existing datasets like VQAv2 and COCO Caption. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsection discussing the construction of MMBench, the authors detail how they collected over 3,000 multiple-choice questions from various sources. They specify that 80% of the questions were sourced from the internet and 20% from public datasets. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets used in MMBench.

I will then look for specific mentions of datasets in the **data collection and quality control sections**. Here, the authors list several datasets that contributed to MMBench, including:

1. **COCO**: A well-known dataset for image captioning and object detection.
2. **GQA**: A dataset for visual question answering.
3. **VQAv2**: Another dataset for visual question answering.
4. **Nocaps**: A dataset for novel object captioning.
5. **TextVQA**: A dataset that involves questions about text in images.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **COCO**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Ma, Sergio Guadarrama, and Piotr DollÃ¡r. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **GQA**:
  > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). *GQA: A New Dataset for Real-World Visual Reasoning and Compositional Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **VQAv2**:
  > Antol, J., Huang, J., Mitchell, M., Paluri, M., & Batra, D. (2015). *VQA: Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **Nocaps**:
  > Agrawal, H., et al. (2019). *Nocaps: Novel Object Captioning at Scale*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **TextVQA**:
  > Gupta, A., et al. (2019). *TextVQA: Text-based Visual Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
