To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly-Supervised Learning-Based Feature Localization for Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy Glioma Images" by Mohammadhassan Izadyyazdanabadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a model for feature localization in CLE images of gliomas, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for training and validation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of manual annotation of histopathology images and mention that they constructed a dataset for their weakly-supervised learning model. This hints at the existence of a dataset but does not provide specific names or details.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where they describe the dataset creation. Here, they state that a "classification dataset" was created, which included **6,287 CLE images** (3,126 diagnostic and 3,161 nondiagnostic) from **20 patients with glioma brain tumors**. This dataset is crucial for their model training.

Additionally, in the **experimental setup**, they mention a **segmentation dataset** consisting of **310 CLE images** annotated by four neurosurgeons. This dataset is used to validate the model's performance in segmenting diagnostic features.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are constructed from images acquired during the study, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

1. **Classification Dataset**: 
   - Description: 6,287 CLE images (3,126 diagnostic and 3,161 nondiagnostic) from 20 patients with glioma brain tumors.
   - Citation: Not formally cited, but the dataset is derived from the authors' own data collection during the study.

2. **Segmentation Dataset**: 
   - Description: 310 CLE images annotated by four neurosurgeons, used for validating the model's segmentation performance.
   - Citation: Not formally cited, as it is also derived from the authors' own data collection.

Since these datasets are not publicly available or formally published, I will note that they are constructed from the authors' own research and do not have standard citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
