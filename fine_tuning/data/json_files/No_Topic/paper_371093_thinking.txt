To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Ridgelet Transform: Winning Lottery Ticket of Neural Networks with Quantum Computation" by Hayata Yamasaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "MNIST dataset," I will look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of proper citation as highlighted in the task.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
