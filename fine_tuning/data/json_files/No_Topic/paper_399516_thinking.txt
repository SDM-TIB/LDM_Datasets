To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Translation Models Stand Strong in the Face of Adversarial Attacks" by Pavel Burnyshev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but may not specify datasets. The introduction may mention datasets used for experiments or comparisons, so I will pay close attention to that section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as it often contains specific information about the datasets used in the research. In this case, the authors mention using the **wmt-14 dataset** for training and validation purposes. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **related work section** and the **references section** for any additional datasets that may have been used or referenced in the context of the research. However, it seems that the primary dataset mentioned is the wmt-14 dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **wmt-14 dataset**. The citation is typically found in the references section, where the authors would have cited the original source of the dataset. In this case, the wmt-14 dataset is commonly associated with the following citation:

> Bojar, O., et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1â€“30, 2014.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing.
