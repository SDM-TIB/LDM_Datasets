To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Mitosis Detection: Towards Diverse Data and Feature Representation" by Hao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several popular mitosis detection datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention five datasets used for evaluation: **MIDOG2021, AMIDA2013, MITOSIS2014, TUPAC2016, and MIDOG2022**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **MIDOG2021**: The citation is:
   > Aubreville, M., Stathonikos, N., Bertram, C. A., Klopfleisch, R., Ter Hoeve, N., Ciompi, F., ... & Maier, A. (2023). Mitosis domain generalization in histopathology images—the MIDOG challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 84, 102699.

2. **AMIDA2013**: The citation is:
   > Veta, M., van Diest, P. J., Willems, S. M., Wang, H., Madabhushi, A., Cruz-Roa, A., ... & Larsen, A. B. (2015). Assessment of algorithms for mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathology images. *Medical Image Analysis*, 20(1), 237-248.

3. **MITOSIS2014**: The citation is:

4. **TUPAC2016**: The citation is:
   > Wollmann, T., & Rohr, K. (2017). Deep residual Hough voting for mitotic cell detection in histopathology images. In *2017 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2017)* (pp. 341-344). IEEE.

5. **MIDOG2022**: The citation is:
   > Aubreville, M., Stathonikos, N., Bertram, C. A., Klopfleisch, R., Ter Hoeve, N., Ciompi, F., ... & Maier, A. (2023). Mitosis domain generalization in histopathology images—the MIDOG challenge. *Medical Image Analysis*, 84, 102699.

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference and use in related research.
