To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Reliable and Explainable AI Model for Solid Pulmonary Nodule Diagnosis" by Chenglong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved a test AUC on the **LIDC public dataset** and an **in-house dataset**. This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **Introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction does not provide new dataset names but reinforces the importance of the datasets used in the study.

Moving on to the **Materials** section, I will focus on the detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors explicitly describe two datasets:

1. **LIDC/IDRI Dataset**: This dataset is an open dataset collected from seven academic centers. It includes manually annotated nodule masks, diagnostic labels, and five relevant manifestations. The authors mention that they used the average scores of malignancy as the final diagnosis for nodules.

2. **In-house Dataset**: This dataset is collected from The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, containing 816 nodules from 816 participants. The authors describe the purpose of this dataset as differentiating invasive lung cancer with micropapillary or solid patterns.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LIDC/IDRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Armato, S. G., 3rd, et al. "The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Image Database Resource Initiative (IDRI): a completed reference database of lung nodules on CT scans." *Med Phys*, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 915-931, Feb 2011. doi: 10.1118/1.3528204.

- The **in-house dataset** does not have a formal citation as it is proprietary data collected by the authors. However, I will note that it is from The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
