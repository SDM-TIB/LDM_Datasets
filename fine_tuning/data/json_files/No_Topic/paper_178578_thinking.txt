To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Fusion via a Series of Transfers for Noise Removal" by Chang-Hwan Son and Xiao-Ping Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of near-infrared gray images (NGI) and visible color images (VCI), indicating that these are the primary datasets involved in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors describe the characteristics of NGI and VCI, but they do not provide specific dataset names or references at this point. 

I will then examine the **experimental results section** where the authors present their findings. They refer to the captured VCI and NGI images used in their experiments, but again, they do not provide formal dataset names or citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them, I will need to refer to the **References section** to find any relevant works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies. 

In the references, I will look for any papers that might have introduced or used the NGI and VCI datasets. However, it appears that the authors primarily discuss their own methodology without citing external datasets.

After reviewing the references, I will note that while the paper discusses the use of NGI and VCI, it does not provide full citations for these datasets as they are likely proprietary or specific to the authors' experiments.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
1. **Near-infrared Gray Image (NGI)**: A noise-free grayscale image captured under low-light conditions.
2. **Visible Color Image (VCI)**: A color image captured under the same conditions but contains noise.

Since no formal citations are provided for these datasets in the paper, I will acknowledge that they are not publicly available datasets and do not have associated citations.

Now, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing, but I will note the lack of formal dataset citations in my output.
