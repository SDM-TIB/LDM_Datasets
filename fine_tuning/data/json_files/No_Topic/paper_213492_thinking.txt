To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-driven Prognostics with Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Ensemble of Deep Ordinal Regression Models" by Vishnu TV et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their approach through empirical evaluation on **C-MAPSS turbofan engine benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 6 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **FD001 Dataset**: This dataset consists of time series readings for 24 sensors from 100 instances of a turbofan engine, capturing data from the beginning of usage until failure. The training set is specified as "train FD001.txt," and the actual RUL values are available in "RUL FD001.txt."

2. **FD004 Dataset**: Similar to FD001, this dataset contains time series readings for 24 sensors but from 249 instances of a turbofan engine. The training set is "train FD004.txt," and the actual RUL values are in "RUL FD004.txt."

The authors also describe how they simulate scenarios for censored instances by truncating the time series data prior to failure, which is important for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **C-MAPSS Dataset**, which includes both FD001 and FD004, the citation is:
  > Saxena, A., & Goebel, K. (2008). Turbofan engine degradation simulation data set. NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the specified format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
