To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parametric model-based 3D human shape and pose estimation from multiple views" by Zhongguo Li, Anders Heyden, and Magnus Oskarsson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and may hint at the datasets used. In this case, it mentions that results were demonstrated on both synthetic and real data, indicating that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 male and 50 female 3D human bodies created using the SMPL model. The authors specify that all bodies were set to an "A" pose, and the dataset includes ground truth for 2D joint points and silhouettes.

2. **Real Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being from a previous work (specifically cited as [25]). It consists of ten image sequences captured by eight cameras in an indoor scene, with specific sequences used for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **synthetic dataset**, since it is generated by the authors using the SMPL model, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is based on the SMPL model as described in the paper.

- For the **real dataset**, I will look up the citation for the work referenced as [25]:
  > Vlasic, D., Baran, I., Matusik, W., & Popović, J. (2008). Articulated mesh animation from multi-view silhouettes. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 27(3), 97:1–97:9.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
