To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Summarisation of Short-Term and Long-Term Videos using Texture and Colour" by Johanna Carvajal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **50 short-term videos from the Open Video Project** and a **new underwater surveillance dataset containing 33 long-term videos**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Open Video Project**: The authors specify that they used **50 short-term videos** from this project, which contain ground truth summaries provided by users. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their video summarisation methods.

2. **Underwater Surveillance Dataset**: This dataset consists of **14 hours of underwater video footage** from **33 videos**, specifically monitoring marine wildlife. The authors highlight its significance in detecting a rare species of fish, which adds context to its use.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the Open Video Project is a well-known dataset, and its citation can be derived from its official website. The underwater surveillance dataset is described as being obtained from the **NSW-DPI**, courtesy of David Harasti, which may not have a formal citation but can be referenced as such.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Open Video Project**, I will note:
  > Open Video Project. *Open Video Project: A Repository of Open Video Content*. Available at: http://www.open-video.org.

- For the **Underwater Surveillance Dataset**, I will note:
  > NSW Department of Primary Industries (NSW-DPI). *Underwater Surveillance Dataset*. Courtesy of David Harasti.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entries in the required format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and proper attribution.
