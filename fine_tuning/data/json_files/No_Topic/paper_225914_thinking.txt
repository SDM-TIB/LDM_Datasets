To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAMP: Cross-Modal Adaptive Message Passing for Text-Image Retrieval" by Zihao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on two widely used text-image retrieval datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.2), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate their approach on **Flickr30K** and **COCO** datasets. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the experiments.

1. **Flickr30K Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 31,783 images, each with 5 unique corresponding sentences. They also mention the validation and testing splits used in their experiments.

2. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 123,287 images, each with 5 annotated sentences. The authors refer to the widely used Karpathy split, which includes specific numbers for training, validation, and testing images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

- For **Flickr30K**, the citation is:
  > Peter Young, Alice Lai, Micah Hodosh, and Julia Hockenmaier. *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2:67–78, 2014.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
