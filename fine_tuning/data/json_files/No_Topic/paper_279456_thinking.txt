To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Covid-19 Pandemic Changes the Theory of Economics?" by Matti Estola, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are referenced or implied. The abstract discusses the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on economic behavior and mentions forecasting bankruptcies, which suggests that there may be relevant statistical data or datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss empirical evaluations or statistical analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, statistics, or references to data sources. For instance, in the introduction, the author cites Statistics Finland, which reports on bankruptcy processes during the pandemic. This indicates that there may be a dataset related to bankruptcy statistics.

I will also check the **references section** for any studies or datasets that the author might have used to support their arguments. The references may include datasets or sources that provide empirical data relevant to the paper's claims.

After identifying potential datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, if the paper refers to the bankruptcy statistics from Statistics Finland, I will note the following citation:

- **Statistics Finland**: Statistics Finland. "Bankruptcy Statistics." Available at: https://www.stat.fi/index_en.html.

If the paper references any other datasets or studies, I will extract their citations in a similar manner, ensuring that I capture all necessary details such as authors, titles, publication years, and any relevant URLs.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used or referenced in the paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or research.
