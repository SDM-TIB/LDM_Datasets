To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeeperBind: Enhancing Prediction of Sequence Specificities of DNA Binding Proteins" by Hamid Reza Hassanzadeh and May D. Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors apply their method to datasets derived from protein binding microarrays (PBMs), which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **materials and methods** section. In this paper, the authors mention using data from PBM experiments to evaluate their proposed method. They specifically refer to datasets retrieved from the **UniProbe database**, which is a key detail.

In the **results section**, the authors describe their experiments using two independent assays (array #1 and array #2) for two transcription factors, CEH-22 and Oct-1. Each assay contains between 40,000 and 42,000 probes with their measured intensities. This information is critical as it provides context about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant sources:

1. For the **UniProbe database**, the citation is:
   > Daniel E Newburger and Martha L Bulyk. *Uniprobe: an online database of protein binding microarray data on protein–dna interactions*. Nucleic acids research, 37(suppl 1):D77–D82, 2009.

2. For the **PBM technology**, the citation is:
   > Michael F. Berger and Martha L. Bulyk. *Universal protein-binding microarrays for the comprehensive characterization of the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors*. Nature protocols, 4(3):393–411, 2009.

3. The authors also reference the original DeepBind paper, which is relevant for understanding the context of their datasets:
   > Babak Alipanahi, Andrew Delong, Matthew T Weirauch, and Brendan J Frey. *Predicting the sequence specificities of dna-and rna-binding proteins by deep learning*. Nature biotechnology, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
