To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEAVERTAILS: Towards Improved Safety Alignment of LLM via a Human-Preference Dataset" by Jiaming Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the **BEAVERTAILS dataset**, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset discussed in the paper. It also highlights the dataset's purpose and the number of question-answer pairs it contains.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will find two iterations of the BEAVERTAILS dataset:

1. **BEAVERTAILS-30k**: This dataset contains 30,207 QA pairs across 14 potential harm categories, derived from 7,774 unique prompts. It includes annotations for helpfulness and harmlessness metrics.

2. **BEAVERTAILS-330k**: This expanded dataset includes 333,963 QA pairs across the same 14 harm categories, derived from 16,851 unique prompts. It also features a more extensive collection of human-preference annotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss the applications of the BEAVERTAILS dataset in various tasks, confirming its significance in their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The BEAVERTAILS dataset is the primary focus of the paper, and it is essential to provide its citation accurately.

The citation for the BEAVERTAILS dataset is:
> Ji, J., Liu, M., Dai, J., Pan, X., Zhang, C., Bian, C., Chen, B., Sun, R., Wang, Y., & Yang, Y. (2023). BEAVERTAILS: Towards Improved Safety Alignment of LLM via a Human-Preference Dataset. In Proceedings of the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
