To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Temporal Interpolation of Radar-Based Precipitation" by Michiaki Tatsubori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions an experiment with the **Meteonet radar precipitation dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the study.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss their experiments. They specifically mention using the **Meteonet dataset** for validating their proposed interpolation method. This section provides context on how the dataset was used, confirming its significance in the research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments section** or elsewhere in the paper. The authors reference the **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)** dataset, which is used for topographical elevation data. This dataset is crucial for understanding the geographical context of the precipitation data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **Meteonet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Meteonet. "Meteonet Radar Precipitation Dataset." Available at: https://meteonet.umr-cnrm.fr

2. For the **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)** dataset, the citation is:
   > J. J. van Zyl. "The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM): A Breakthrough in Remote Sensing of Topography." *Acta Astronautica*, vol. 48, no. 5, pp. 559â€“565, 2001.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
