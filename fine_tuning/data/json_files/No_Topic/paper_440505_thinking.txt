To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensembling Portfolio Strategies for Long-Term Investments: A Distribution-Free Preference Framework for Decision-Making and Algorithms" by Duy Khanh Lam, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments and that the dataset was provided by The Center for Research in Security Prices, LLC. This indicates that there is a dataset used for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author describes the dataset in detail. In this section, it is stated that the dataset spans a comprehensive range of **27 years**, covering significant market events and includes **six blue-chip stock symbols**. The specific stocks mentioned are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), The Boeing Company (BA), Honeywell International Inc. (HON), The Coca-Cola Company (KO), 3M Company (MMM), and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). This information is crucial for documenting the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper states that the data was sourced from The Center for Research in Security Prices, LLC (CRSP), but it does not provide a specific citation format for this dataset. However, I can note that the dataset is from CRSP and spans from **December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2019**.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format:

1. **Dataset Name**: CRSP Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing daily adjusted closing prices of six blue-chip stocks over a 27-year period, covering significant market events.
   - **Stock Symbols**: AMD, BA, HON, KO, MMM, XOM
   - **Time Span**: December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2019
   - **Source**: The Center for Research in Security Prices, LLC (CRSP)

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note the source as it is mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its name, description, stock symbols, time span, and source, to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
