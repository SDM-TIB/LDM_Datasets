To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BRIDGENETS: STUDENT-TEACHER TRANSFER LEARNING BASED ON RECURSIVE NEURAL NETWORKS AND ITS APPLICATION TO DISTANT SPEECH RECOGNITION" by Jaeyoung Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions significant improvements in distant speech recognition using the AMI corpus, which suggests that this corpus is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. They specifically mention the **AMI corpus** as a dataset used for training and evaluation. The AMI corpus is described as containing 100 hours of meeting conversations recorded with both individual headset microphones (IHM) and single distant microphones (SDM). This section provides valuable details about the dataset's characteristics.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors refer to the **SDM and MDM** data, which are derived from the AMI corpus. The SDM data is noted to have high noise and interference, while the MDM data is formed by beamforming multiple SDM channels.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **AMI corpus**, the citation is:
   > Jean Carletta, Simone Ashby, Sebastien Bourban, Mike Flynn, Mael Guillemot, Thomas Hain, Jaroslav Kadlec, Vasilis Karaiskos, Wessel Kraaij, Melissa Kronenthal, et al. "The AMI meeting corpus: A pre-announcement." In International Workshop on Machine Learning for Multimodal Interaction. Springer, 2005, pp. 28â€“39.

2. The **Kaldi toolkit** is also mentioned as a tool used for training and decoding, but it is not a dataset itself. The same goes for the **Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)**.

3. The **SDM and MDM data** are derived from the AMI corpus, so they do not require separate citations.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
