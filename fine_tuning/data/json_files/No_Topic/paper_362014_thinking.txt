To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POLICE: Provably Optimal Linear Constraint Enforcement for Deep Neural Networks" by Randall Balestriero and Yann LeCun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the proposed method but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **subsequent sections** for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of enforcing constraints in deep neural networks but do not specify any datasets. I will then look into the **methodology and empirical validation sections** to see if any datasets are used for validation or experimentation.

Upon reviewing the **empirical validation section**, I find that the authors mention applying the POLICE method to various tasks, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. This suggests that the paper may not focus on specific datasets but rather on the methodology itself.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and do not point to specific datasets used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or details, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are mentioned.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "POLICE: Provably Optimal Linear Constraint Enforcement for Deep Neural Networks" by Randall Balestriero and Yann LeCun, and thus no citations can be provided.
