To extract datasets from the research paper titled "L3U-net: Low-Latency Lightweight U-net Based Image Segmentation Model for Parallel CNN Processors" by Osman Erman Okman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two different segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 5.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid)**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and includes 601 images with ground truth labels for 32 semantic classes. The authors specify that they used three classes for their application and provide details about the training and testing splits.

2. **AISegment**: This dataset consists of 34,427 human portrait images with corresponding masks. The authors describe the dataset's resolution and the training-test split ratio.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gabriel J. Brostow, Jamie Shotton, Julien Fauqueur, and Roberto Cipolla. *Segmentation and Recognition Using Structure from Motion Point Clouds*. In ECCV (1), 44â€“57, 2008.

- For the **AISegment dataset**, the citation is:
  > Laurent H. 2018. *AISegment.com - Matting Human Datasets*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/laurentmih/aisegmentcom-matting-human-datasets. Accessed: 2021-12-10.

Now that I have the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
