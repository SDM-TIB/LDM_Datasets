To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Refining Event Extraction as Type-oriented Binary Decoding" by Sijia Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **ACE and ERE**, which suggests that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they performed experiments on two public benchmark datasets: **ACE05-E+** and **ERE-EN**. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided in the paper. In section 3.1, the authors provide data statistics for both datasets:

1. **ACE05-E+**: This dataset includes 4419 events in the training set, 468 in the development set, and 424 in the test set. It defines 33 event types.

2. **ERE-EN**: This dataset contains 7394 events in the training set, 632 in the development set, and 669 in the test set. It includes 38 event types, with 31 of them overlapping with ACE.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ACE**:
  > Chinchor, N., & Marsh, E. (1998). MUC-7 Information Extraction Task Definition. In Proceedings of the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC-7), Appendices, pages 359–367.

- For **ERE**:
  > Song, Z., Bies, A., Strassel, S., Riese, T., Mott, J., Ellis, J., Wright, J., Kulick, S., Ryant, N., & Ma, X. (2015). From Light to Rich ERE: Annotation of Entities, Relations, and Events. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on EVENTS: Definition, Detection, Coreference, and Representation, pages 89–98.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
