To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OSRE: Object-to-Spot Rotation Estimation for Bike Parking Assessment" by Saghir Alfasly et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a **Synthetic Bike Rotation Dataset (SynthBRSet)**, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Synthetic Bike Parking Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain how the dataset was generated using 3D graphics and highlight its features, such as variations in bike models, rotations, and camera angles. This section confirms the existence of the **SynthBRSet** dataset and provides essential details about its composition.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they collected and annotated a real-world subset of bike images, which includes 175 bike objects with varying parking poses. This indicates another dataset, albeit smaller, that is used for evaluation purposes.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Synthetic Bike Rotation Dataset (SynthBRSet)**: This dataset is generated using Blender and contains a large number of bike images with accurate rotation annotations. The authors emphasize its diversity and balance, making it suitable for training deep learning models.

2. **Real-world Bike Dataset**: This dataset consists of 175 images of bikes collected in real-world scenarios, annotated with their respective parking poses. It serves as a validation set for the proposed model.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the **SynthBRSet** is a novel dataset created by the authors, it may not have a traditional citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available at the provided GitHub link in the paper.

For the real-world dataset, the authors do not provide a specific citation since it is a collection of images they gathered. Therefore, I will mention it as a dataset created for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations:

- **Synthetic Bike Rotation Dataset (SynthBRSet)**: 
  - Description: A synthetic dataset generated using Blender, containing a diverse set of bike images with accurate rotation annotations.
  - Citation: Available at [GitHub link](https://github.com/saghiralfasly/OSRE-Project).

- **Real-world Bike Dataset**: 
  - Description: A dataset consisting of 175 annotated images of bikes in various parking poses, collected from real-world scenarios.
  - Citation: Not formally cited; created for this study.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
