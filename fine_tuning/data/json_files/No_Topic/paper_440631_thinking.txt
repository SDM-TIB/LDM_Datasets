To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Primitive Agentic First-Order Optimization" by R. Sala, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, it is crucial to identify if the author explicitly mentions any datasets used for training or testing the optimization methods discussed.

As I read through the paper, I will pay close attention to any **case studies or results sections** where datasets might be referenced. For example, if the author discusses specific optimization problems or experiments, they may mention the datasets used to derive their results.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. It is important to ensure that I capture the correct and complete citation format as provided by the author.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to optimization problems, as the focus is on reinforcement learning and optimization techniques. If the author refers to standard datasets or benchmarks, I will note those down as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is critical for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in this research paper effectively.
