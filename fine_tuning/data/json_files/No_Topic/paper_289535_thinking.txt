To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlated evolution: models and methods" by G. Achaz and J.Y. Dutheil, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The introduction often provides context and may highlight key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for analysis, including any specific datasets that were collected or analyzed by the authors. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they often summarize data and may include references to specific datasets. If any datasets are presented in a figure or table, I will note them down.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For each dataset identified, I will ensure to document:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references section of the paper.

Once I have compiled this information, I will organize it clearly to ensure that each dataset is well-documented and easily accessible for future reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets mentioned in the paper.
