To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Innovative Speech-Based Deep Learning Approaches for Parkinson’s Disease Classification: A Systematic Review" by Lisanne van Gelderen and Cristian Tejedor-García, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the review discusses publicly accessible speech-based datasets for Parkinson's disease (PD), which suggests that specific datasets will be listed.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention the limited availability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets. This section may provide context for the datasets discussed later in the paper.

I will then examine **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is likely where the authors present the specific datasets used in the studies they reviewed. I will look for tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of speakers, language, and types of speech tasks.

In **Appendix A**, the authors provide a detailed table (Table A1) listing publicly available speech-based datasets for PD research. This table includes crucial information such as the dataset name, source, number of speakers, transcripts, disease severity, language, overall speech time, data quality, and speech tasks. I will extract the relevant datasets from this table.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are essential for proper referencing. Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further use or analysis.
