To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiview Detection with Shadow Transformer" by Yunzhong Hou and Liang Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two multiview detection benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Wildtrack**: This is described as a real-world dataset focusing on a specific area with multiple synchronized cameras. The authors provide details about the number of frames and the training/testing split.

2. **MultiviewX**: This is a synthetic dataset created using the Unity engine, and the authors provide similar details about its structure and purpose.

I will also check the **related work** and **method** sections to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced that might be relevant to the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Wildtrack**, the citation is:
  > Tatjana Chavdarova, Pierre Baqué, Stéphane Bouquet, Andrii Maksai, Cijo Jose, Timur Bagautdinov, Louis Lettry, Pascal Fua, Luc Van Gool, and François Fleuret. *Wildtrack: A multi-camera hd dataset for dense unscripted pedestrian detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5030–5039, 2018.

- For **MultiviewX**, the citation is:
  > Yunzhong Hou, Liang Zheng, and Stephen Gould. *Multiview detection with feature perspective transformation*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1–18, 2020.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the datasets used in the research.
