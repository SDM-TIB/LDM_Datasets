To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subspace Segmentation by Successive Approximations" by João Carvalho, Manuel Marques, and João P. Costeira, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's application to "synthetic and real data," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using both synthetic data and real datasets for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are named or described in detail.

In **subsection 4.1 (Synthetic Data)**, the authors describe how they generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. Instead, they outline the parameters used to create these datasets, which is useful for understanding the experimental setup but does not constitute a formal dataset citation.

In **subsection 4.2 (Applications)**, the authors mention two specific datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Hopkins 155 Dataset**: This dataset contains 155 sequences with 2 or 3 objects each, used for motion segmentation. The authors mention that they added missing data to this dataset for their experiments.

2. **CMU Mocap Dataset**: This dataset is used for motion capture problems, where several sensors capture the motion of a human performing various activities. The authors also mention generating missing data for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Hopkins 155 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Y. Ng, M. I. Jordan, Y. Weiss, et al. *On spectral clustering: Analysis and an algorithm*. In NIPS, volume 14, pages 849–856, 2001.

- For the **CMU Mocap Dataset**, the citation is:
  > CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database. *CMU Motion Capture Database*. Available at: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Hopkins 155 Dataset**: Used for motion segmentation experiments, with added missing data for evaluation.
2. **CMU Mocap Dataset**: Used for motion capture experiments, also with added missing data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
