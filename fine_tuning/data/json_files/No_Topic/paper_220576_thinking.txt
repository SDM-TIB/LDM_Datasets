To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating User-friendly Explanations for Loan Denials using GANs" by Ramya Srinivasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset that is representative of loan-applicant friendly explanations, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the need for explanations in AI-based loan decisions, hinting at the significance of the dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they collected. They refer to this dataset as **X-Net**, which was built through a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). The section details how the dataset consists of 2432 sentences that provide reasons for loan denials, along with annotations for broad and specific reasons.

Additionally, the authors mention a second dataset called **Extended X-Net**, which includes pairs of explanations serving different purposes (education and action). This dataset was also curated in collaboration with a linguist and consists of 2432 sentence pairs.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are original contributions of the authors, they may not have external citations. However, I will note that the authors have created these datasets themselves, and I will document this appropriately.

1. **X-Net**: A dataset of 2432 sentences with reasons for loan denials, collected via a survey on AMT.
   - Citation: Ramya Srinivasan, Ajay Chander, Pouya Pezeshkpour. *Generating User-friendly Explanations for Loan Denials using GANs*. NIPS 2018 Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities for AI in Financial Services.

2. **Extended X-Net**: A dataset consisting of 2432 sentence pairs corresponding to educational and action-oriented explanations.
   - Citation: Ramya Srinivasan, Ajay Chander, Pouya Pezeshkpour. *Generating User-friendly Explanations for Loan Denials using GANs*. NIPS 2018 Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities for AI in Financial Services.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
