To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A HVS-inspired Attention to Improve Loss Metrics for CNN-based Perception-Oriented Super-Resolution" by Taimoor Tariq et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses perceptual quality metrics and CNN-based super-resolution but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to dig deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Super-Resolution Experiments)**, where the authors mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for their x4 image super-resolution experiments. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In **subsection 4.2 (Objective Quality Test)**, the authors refer to the **LIVE subjective image quality database** for human subjective assessment of perceptual quality. This is another dataset that needs to be included.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DIV2K dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lim, B., Son, S., Kim, H., Nah, S., & Lee, K. M. (2017). Enhanced deep residual networks for single image super-resolution. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 136–144.

2. For the **LIVE subjective image quality database**, the citation is:
   > Sheikh, H. R., Sabir, M. F., & Bovik, A. C. (2006). A statistical evaluation of recent full reference image quality assessment algorithms. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 15(11), 3440–3451.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
