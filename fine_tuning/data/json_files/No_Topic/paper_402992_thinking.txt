To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Reliable Are AI-Generated-Text Detectors? An Assessment Framework Using Evasive Soft Prompts" by Tharindu Kumarage et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of various high-performing detectors and the development of a novel approach, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the proliferation of AI-generated text and the emergence of detectors, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **experiment setup** and **writing tasks** subsections. In the experiment setup, the authors describe the AI text generators (PLMs) used, but I need to focus on the writing tasks to identify datasets. 

In **section 4.2 (Writing Tasks)**, the authors specify the datasets used for different writing tasks:

1. **TuringBench Dataset**: This dataset is used for news writing and includes human-written news articles from reputable sources such as CNN and The Washington Post.
   - Citation: Uchendu, A., Ma, Z., Le, T., Zhang, R., & Lee, D. (2021). *Turingbench: A benchmark environment for turing test in the age of neural text generation*. In 2021 Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Findings of ACL: EMNLP 2021, pages 2001–2016. Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

2. **Xsum Dataset**: This dataset is also used for news writing and contains BBC articles.
   - Citation: Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807.

3. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is used for academic writing and consists of questions for machine comprehension of text.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). *SQUAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392.

4. **Reddit Writing Prompts Dataset**: This dataset is used for creative writing tasks and includes various writing prompts from Reddit.
   - Citation: Fan, A., Lewis, M., & Dauphin, Y. (2018). *Hierarchical neural story generation*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 889–898.

After identifying these datasets, I will cross-reference the **References section** to ensure that I have the correct citations for each dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
