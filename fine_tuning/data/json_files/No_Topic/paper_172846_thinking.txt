To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatchShuffle Regularization" by Guoliang Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four representative classification datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to identify their names.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The authors describe it as containing 50,000 training and 10,000 test images across 10 object classes.
2. **SVHN**: This dataset consists of 73,257 training and 26,032 test images of street view house numbers.
3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes 5,000 training and 8,000 test images across 10 categories.
4. **MNIST**: This dataset comprises 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

I will confirm that these datasets are indeed used in the experiments by checking the context in which they are mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the **experiments section**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Citeseer, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, page 5, 2011.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223, 2011.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. volume 86, pages 2278–2324. IEEE, 1998.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
