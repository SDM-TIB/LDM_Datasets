To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Query Focused Summaries from Query-Free Resources" by Yumo Xu and Mirella Lapata, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of query-focused summarization (QFS) and hints at the use of large-scale datasets for training models, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **DUC 2005-2007 QFS benchmarks** and the **TD-QFS dataset**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and any relevant statistics.

In the **table provided in the experiments section**, I will find the statistics for the datasets, which include the number of clusters, queries per cluster, documents per cluster, and summaries per query. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and usage.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following datasets:

1. **DUC 2005-2007 QFS benchmarks**: These datasets are used for evaluating query-focused summarization systems. The citation for the DUC datasets is:
   > Dang, H. T. (2005). Overview of DUC 2005. In Proceedings of the 2005 Document Understanding Conference, pages 1-12, Vancouver, Canada.

2. **TD-QFS dataset**: This dataset focuses on medical texts with short keyword queries. The citation for the TD-QFS dataset is:
   > Baumel, T., Cohen, T., & Elhadad, M. (2016). Topic concentration in query focused summarization datasets. In Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 2573-2579, Phoenix, Arizona.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
