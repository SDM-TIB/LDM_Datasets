To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Poisoning Attacks on Neighborhood-based Recommender Systems" by Liang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments are conducted on three real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: **FilmTrust**, **Movielens**, and **Amazons**. I will note down these names and any relevant details provided about each dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the datasets, including the number of users, items, ratings, and sparsity. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically formatted in a standard way, and I will ensure to capture the complete reference for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **FilmTrust**: The citation is:
   > Guo G, Zhang J, Yorke-Smith N. *A novel bayesian similarity measure for recommender systems*. In: ; 2013.

2. **Movielens**: The citation is:
   > Harper F, Konstan J. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 2015.

3. **Amazons**: The citation is:
   > McAuley J, Leskovec J. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Growth of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In: Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its relevant details and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
