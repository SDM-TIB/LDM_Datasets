To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatial Population Genetics: Itâ€™s About Time" by Gideon S. Bradburd and Peter L. Ralph, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the geographical component of organisms' histories and dynamics, which suggests that there may be datasets related to genetic variation and population dynamics.

Next, I will examine the **sections that discuss methods and experiments**, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. I will look for sections that detail the methodologies used for analysis, as these often include references to specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of genomic and geospatial data, which indicates that they likely used specific datasets to support their claims. I will pay close attention to any references to empirical studies or datasets that may have been utilized.

As I progress through the paper, I will specifically look for sections that might be titled **"Datasets," "Data Sources,"** or similar. If such sections exist, they will likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will note down their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the geographical scope of the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the original sources.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset from a specific study, I will ensure to include the full citation as follows:

- For a dataset from a specific paper, I will format it like this:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page Range, Year.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a clear and organized approach throughout the process.
