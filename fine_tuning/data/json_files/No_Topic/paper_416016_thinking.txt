To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RIS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication for 6G Systems" by Dexin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a new target localization system but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Simulation Results)**, as this section often contains details about the datasets used for simulations. Here, the authors describe their simulation environment, including the dimensions of the rectangular cell (1000 m Ã— 1000 m) and the number of targets (K). However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets used for validation.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include various papers discussing ISAC, RIS, and related technologies, but they do not seem to point to specific datasets.

Since the paper focuses on simulations rather than empirical data from existing datasets, it appears that there are no named datasets to extract. The authors rely on their simulation results rather than external datasets for validation.

In conclusion, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will note that there are no specific datasets mentioned or cited in the work. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none exist in this context.

Overall, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial clues about datasets.
2. Analyzing the methodology and results sections for any references to datasets.
3. Reviewing the references for any indirect mentions of datasets.
4. Concluding that no datasets were explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper.

This systematic approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched for any potential datasets before concluding their absence.
