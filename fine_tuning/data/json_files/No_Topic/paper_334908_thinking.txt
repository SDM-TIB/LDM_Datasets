To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Smells: Categories, Causes and Consequences, and Detection of Suspicious Data in AI-based Systems" by Harald Foidl, Michael Felderer, and Rudolf Ramler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors present a catalogue of 36 data smells and discuss their detection on more than 240 real-world datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their research method. They mention conducting a multivocal literature review and analyzing over 400 hits to extract latent data issues. However, they do not specify the names of the datasets used in this analysis.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they applied their detection methods on **246 Kaggle datasets**. This is a significant detail, as it indicates the specific source of the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the Kaggle datasets, as they are likely publicly available datasets hosted on the Kaggle platform.

To summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Kaggle Datasets**: The authors analyzed 246 datasets from Kaggle to evaluate their data smell detection methods. While specific dataset names are not provided, Kaggle is a well-known platform for hosting a variety of datasets across different domains.

Since the paper does not provide individual citations for the Kaggle datasets, I will note that the datasets can be accessed through the Kaggle website, and I will include a general citation for Kaggle:

- Kaggle. (n.d.). *Kaggle Datasets*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
