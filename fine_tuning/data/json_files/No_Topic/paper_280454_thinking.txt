To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Helping Reduce Environmental Impact of Aviation with Machine Learning" by Ashish Kapoor, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions improving wind forecasts and aircraft routing methods, which suggests that there may be datasets related to wind data or flight data.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author discusses logging data from aircraft flying over specific states. Here, the paper states that they logged data from **1653 observations from 496 unique aircraft** using FlightAware. This indicates that there is a dataset related to aircraft observations.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The paper mentions using a pre-computed library of trajectories from a previous work, which could imply the existence of another dataset. The reference to the work by C. Green and A. Kelly (2007) is particularly relevant as it discusses optimal sampling in the space of paths, which may relate to the dataset used for trajectory planning.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Aircraft Flight Data**: This dataset consists of 1653 observations from 496 unique aircraft, which were logged using FlightAware. This dataset is crucial for improving wind forecasts and routing policies.

2. **Trajectory Library**: The paper references a pre-computed library of trajectories from the work of C. Green and A. Kelly. This dataset is used for simulating aircraft routing and optimizing flight paths.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FlightAware dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I will note that it is based on publicly available flight data.

- For the **trajectory library**, the citation is:
  > C. Green and A. Kelly. *Toward optimal sampling in the space of paths*. In 13th International Symposium of Robotics Research, 2007.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, preparing them for any structured output or further analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their sources effectively.
