To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why does deep and cheap learning work so well?" by Henry W. Lin, Max Tegmark, and David Rolnick, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there may not be a clearly labeled section, but I will pay attention to any subsections or paragraphs that describe the data used for analysis or experiments. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named or described, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

As I identify datasets, I will also check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

If the paper discusses datasets from other studies or sources, I will ensure to capture those citations as well.

After gathering all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and easily accessible for further use or analysis.

Finally, I will review the entire extraction process to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all citations are accurate and complete.
