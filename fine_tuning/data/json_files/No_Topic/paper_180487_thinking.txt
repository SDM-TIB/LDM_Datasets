To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Deep Metric for Person Re-identification: A Study Against Large Variations" by Hailin Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on several benchmarks for person re-identification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify any specific datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention that their method is tested on three common benchmarks for person re-identification: **CUHK03**, **CUHK01**, and **VIPeR**. I will take note of these datasets and look for detailed descriptions.

In **Section 4.5**, the authors provide a performance analysis on the **CUHK03 dataset**, which contains 1,369 subjects, each with around 10 images. They also mention that the dataset has two versions: one with manually labeled images and another with detected images.

In **Section 4.6**, the authors discuss the **CUHK01 dataset**, which consists of 971 subjects, each having 4 images captured from two camera views. 

In **Section 4.7**, the authors describe the **VIPeR dataset**, which includes 632 subjects, each with 2 images from different cameras. This dataset is noted for being small and challenging for training CNNs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CUHK03**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Wang, X. (2014). *DeepReid: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 152–159.

- For **CUHK01**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Zhao, R., Xiao, T., Wang, X. (2014). *DeepReid: Deep Filter Pairing Neural Network for Person Re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 152–159.

- For **VIPeR**, the citation is:
  > Gray, D., Brennan, S., Tao, H. (2007). *Evaluating Appearance Models for Recognition, Reacquisition, and Tracking*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation for Tracking and Surveillance (PETS), vol. 3.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
