To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal valuation of American callable credit default swaps under drawdown of Lévy insurance risk process" by Z. Palmowski and B.A. Surya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies or the current research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there may be a section that explicitly lists the datasets used for numerical examples or empirical analysis. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets.

If the paper includes numerical examples, I will examine those sections closely, as they often reference specific datasets used for simulations or analyses. I will note any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will ensure that I capture all relevant details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Lévy process dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly mentioned, I will search for the original source of the dataset if it is commonly known or referenced in the literature.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description of its contents, and the citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and concise manner, ready for presentation or further processing.
