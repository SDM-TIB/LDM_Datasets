To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Neural Networks for Physical-Layer Security in Multi-User Flexible-Duplex Networks" by Tharaka Perera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive details about each dataset, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets related to physical-layer security, flexible duplex networks, or any other relevant areas mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to datasets from previous works, I will make sure to cite those original sources.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the complete citation.
