To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Automated labeling of bugs and tickets using attention-based mechanisms in recurrent neural networks" by Volodymyr Lyubinets et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their methods on two datasets: the **Arch Linux bug tracker** and the **Chromium bug tracker**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Comparative Benchmark)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Arch Linux bug tracker dataset**: This dataset contains bugs from the open Arch Linux bug tracker, with a total of 16,456 entries. The authors mention that they wrote a web scraper to acquire this data, and they aim to predict fields such as priority (with 9 classes) and product area (with 16 classes).

2. **Chromium bug tracker dataset**: This dataset is adapted from the Chromium dataset used by the DeepTriage paper, containing 58,871 entries. The authors aim to predict the "Type" field, which can be one of Bug, Feature, or Compatibility issue.

In the **results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for benchmarking various methods, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from existing bug trackers and the authors created them through web scraping, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note the sources from which the datasets were derived:

- For the **Arch Linux bug tracker dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arch Linux Bug Tracker. Available at: https://bugs.archlinux.org.

- For the **Chromium bug tracker dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chromium Bug Tracker. Available at: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
