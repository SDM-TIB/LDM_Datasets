To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ERM++: An Improved Baseline for Domain Generalization" by Piotr Teterwak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on a standard benchmark of **5 datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (DomainBed Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **OfficeHome**: A dataset for 65-way classification with 15,588 samples across 4 domains: art, clipart, product, and real.
2. **DomainNet**: A larger dataset with 345 classes and 586,575 samples across 6 domains: clipart, infograph, painting, quickdraw, real, and sketch.
3. **PACS**: A smaller dataset with 7 classes and 9,991 samples across 4 domains: art, cartoon, photo, and sketch.
4. **VLCS**: A dataset for 5-way classification with 10,729 samples from 4 domains: Caltech101, LabelMe, SUN09, and VOC2007.
5. **TerraIncognita**: A dataset with 10 classes and 24,788 samples, focusing on animals captured in wildlife cameras across different locations.

In addition, the authors mention two out-of-domain datasets in **section 5**:

6. **WILDS-FMoW**: A land-use classification problem with 141,696 samples from 5 regions.
7. **WILDS-PCAM**: A binary classification problem with 455,954 samples from different hospitals.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **OfficeHome**, the citation is:
  > Venkateswara, H., Eusebio, J., Chakraborty, S., & Panchanathan, S. (2017). *Deep hashing network for unsupervised domain adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:

- For **PACS**, the citation is:

- For **VLCS**, the citation is:

- For **TerraIncognita**, the citation is:
  > Beery, S., Van Horn, G., & Perona, P. (2018). *Recognition in terra incognita*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **WILDS-FMoW**, the citation is:
  > Koh, P.W., Sagawa, S., Marklund, H., et al. (2021). *WILDS: A benchmark of in-the-wild distribution shifts*. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

- For **WILDS-PCAM**, the citation is:
  > Bandi, P., et al. (2018). *From detection of individual metastases to classification of lymph node status at the patient level: the camelyon17 challenge*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and accurate, providing a clear reference for each dataset used in the research.
