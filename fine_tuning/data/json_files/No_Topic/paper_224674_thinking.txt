To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Neural Sequence Labeling with Position-Aware Self-Attention" by Wei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three classical tasks in sequence labeling, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They list three benchmark datasets:

1. **CoNLL 2003 NER dataset**: This dataset consists of news wire articles from the Reuters corpus and includes four types of named entities: PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC. The authors mention using the standard dataset split and following the BIOES tagging scheme.

2. **WSJ (Wall Street Journal) portion of the Penn Treebank dataset**: This dataset contains 25 sections and classifies each word into 45 different types of POS tags. The authors specify the standard data split method used for training, development, and testing.

3. **CoNLL 2000 chunking dataset**: This dataset uses sections from the Wall Street Journal corpus for training and testing, defining 11 syntactic chunk types. The authors also mention a random sampling of sentences for development data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CoNLL 2003 NER dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. S. M. A. Ratinov and D. Roth. "Design challenges and misconceptions in named entity recognition." In CoNLL, 2009.

- For the **WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Collins. "Discriminative training methods for hidden markov models: Theory and experiments with perceptron algorithms." In Proceedings of the ACL-02 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing, 2002.

- For the **CoNLL 2000 chunking dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Kudoh and Y. Matsumoto. "Use of support vector learning for chunk identification." In Fourth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, 2000.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
