To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Instance Optimal Bounds for Best Arm Identification" by Lijie Chen, Jian Li, and Mingda Qiao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the work and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections often detail the datasets used in the research, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for experiments, I will record its name and any details provided about its structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
