To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Is It Like to Be a Brain Simulation?" by Eray Ã–zkural, I will follow a systematic approach to identify any datasets mentioned throughout the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract does not mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses philosophical questions regarding brain simulations and subjective experiences but does not reference any datasets. I will continue to the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that might discuss empirical studies or experiments that could involve datasets. I will look for any references to experiments or surveys that might have utilized datasets.

As I read through the sections, I will pay close attention to any citations or references that might indicate the use of datasets. For instance, the author mentions a survey of large-scale brain simulation projects in Garis et al. (2010). I will check if this paper includes any datasets.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations of any datasets mentioned or implied in the text. If the paper by Garis et al. (2010) includes datasets, I will extract that information and provide the full citation.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile a list of any identified datasets along with their full citations. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the necessary details, such as the dataset name, description, and the full citation, formatted correctly for clarity and accuracy.
