To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From phonemes to images: levels of representation in a recurrent neural model of visually-grounded language learning" by Lieke Gelderloos and Grzegorz Chrupała, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model is trained on a phonetically transcribed version of MS-COCO, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the use of larger-scale inputs and mention the MS-COCO dataset explicitly. This confirms its significance in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, the authors detail their methodology and confirm that they trained their model on the MS-COCO dataset. They describe the dataset as containing over 163,000 images with at least five captions each, which is essential for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014, pages 740–755. Springer.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MS-COCO dataset, I will create an entry for it. There are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, so I will finalize my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
