To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Echoes of Multilinguality: Tracing Cultural Value Shifts during LM Fine-tuning" by Rochelle Choenni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experimental setup sections typically detail the specific datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the influence of multilingual language models (MLMs) on cultural values and mention the use of various data sources for fine-tuning. This suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to pinpoint their names.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data sources)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for fine-tuning. They mention three key datasets:

1. **Flores-101**: A dataset containing multilingual parallel data for machine translation, which is likely used for fine-tuning the language models.
2. **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**: A dataset consisting of human-translated sentences from Bible texts, used to study the influence of religious texts on cultural values.
3. **Tanzil dataset**: A dataset containing translations of Quran texts, also used for examining cultural influences.

In addition, the authors mention using articles from various news sources to further investigate the impact of political bias on cultural values.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **Flores-101**, the citation is:
  > Goyal, N., Gao, C., Chaudhary, V., Chen, P.-J., Wenzek, G., Ju, D., Krishnan, S., Ranzato, M., Guzmán, F., & Fan, A. (2022). The flores-101 evaluation benchmark for low-resource and multilingual machine translation. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 10, 522–538.

- For **Parallel Bible Corpus (PBC)**, the citation is:
  > Christodouloupoulos, C., & Steedman, M. (2015). A massively parallel corpus: the bible in 100 languages. *Language Resources and Evaluation*, 49, 375–395.

- For **Tanzil dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tiedemann, J. (2012). Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS. In *Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12)*, pages 2214–2218.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
