To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Representation Training in Sequential Tasks with Shared Structure" by Aldo Pacchiano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to reinforcement learning or multi-task learning, as the title suggests a focus on these areas.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to document the following for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would document it as follows:
- **Name**: OpenAI Gym
- **Description**: A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, providing a variety of environments.
- **Full citation**: Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. et al. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549 (2016).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is clearly structured and ready for further processing or review. This methodical approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
