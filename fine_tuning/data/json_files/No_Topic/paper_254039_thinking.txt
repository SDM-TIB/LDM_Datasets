To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matching Guided Distillation" by Kaiyu Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4 in this case) closely, as this section typically details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on several popular datasets. I will look for specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset composed of 50,000 images across 100 classes, with a fixed input size of 32x32 pixels.
2. **ImageNet (IN-1K)**: A large-scale dataset containing 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 object categories.
3. **Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)**: A fine-grained dataset for categorizing birds, containing 11,788 images of 200 bird classes.
4. **COCO**: A standard benchmark for object detection and instance segmentation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. rep., Citeseer (2009).

- For **ImageNet (IN-1K)**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In: CVPR (2009).

- For **Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200)**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology (2011).

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In: ECCV (2014).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
