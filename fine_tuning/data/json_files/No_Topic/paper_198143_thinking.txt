To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combinaison d’information visuelle, conceptuelle, et contextuelle pour la construction automatique de hiérarchies sémantiques adaptées à l’annotation d’images" by Hichem Bannour and Céline Hudelot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized or compared against.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any experimental setup described by the authors. This section typically outlines the datasets used for training and testing their proposed methods. If the authors describe their experiments in detail, they may provide specific names and characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their method on these datasets. This can provide additional confirmation that the datasets are indeed relevant to the research.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and the corresponding citations. For example, if the authors mention using the **Pascal VOC dataset**, I would look for the citation:

- For **Pascal VOC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
