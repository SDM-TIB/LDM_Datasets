To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parkinson’s Disease Detection via Resting-State Electroencephalography Using Signal Processing and Machine Learning Techniques" by Krish Desai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that EEG data was collected from 15 PD patients and 16 healthy controls, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Materials and Methods)**, where the author provides a detailed overview of the dataset. The paper states that the data was collected from UC San Diego’s Resting State EEG Data for healthy control and Parkinson’s patients. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides some demographic details about the participants.

In this section, the author mentions that the dataset comprises resting state EEG recordings from 15 PD patients and 16 healthy controls, along with their mean ages. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites multiple sources related to the EEG data, specifically references [16], [17], [18], and [19]. I will need to extract the relevant citations for these references to provide complete information about the dataset.

The citations for the EEG dataset are as follows:

1. **UC San Diego’s Resting State EEG Data**:
   - Nicko Jackson, Scott R. Cole, Bradley Voytek, Nicole C. Swann. *Characteristics of Waveform Shape in Parkinson’s Disease Detected with Scalp Electroencephalography*. eNeuro 20 May 2019, 6 (3) ENEURO.0151-19.2019; DOI: 10.1523/ENEURO.0151-19.2019.

2. **Additional EEG Data References**:

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
