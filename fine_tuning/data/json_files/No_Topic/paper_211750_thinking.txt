To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting Neural Machine Translation with Knowledge Graphs" by Diego Moussallem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of knowledge graphs to enhance neural machine translation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of data sparsity in neural machine translation but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup** section, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using a parallel training corpus consisting of a merge of the initial one-third of the **JRC-Acquis 3.0**, **Europarl**, and **OpenSubtitles2013**. This indicates that these three datasets are used for training their models.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the **results** or **discussion** sections. The results section provides insights into the performance of the models on various test datasets, specifically the **WMT newstest datasets** from 2014 to 2018. These datasets are crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **JRC-Acquis 3.0**: 
   > Ralf Steinberger, Bruno Pouliquen, Anna Widiger, Camelia Ignat, Tomaz Erjavec, Dan Tufis, and Dániel Varga. *The JRC-Acquis: A multilingual aligned parallel corpus with 20+ languages*. In Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2006.

2. **Europarl**: 
   > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In MT summit, volume 5, pages 79–86, 2005.

3. **OpenSubtitles2013**: 
   > Jürgen Tiedemann. *Parallel data, tools and interfaces in opus*. In Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), Istanbul, Turkey. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2012.

4. **WMT newstest datasets**: 
   > Various authors. *WMT newstest datasets 2014-2018*. Available at: [WMT website](http://www.statmt.org/wmt/).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
