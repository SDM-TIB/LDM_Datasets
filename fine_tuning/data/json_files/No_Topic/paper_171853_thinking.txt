To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actively Learning what makes a Discrete Sequence Valid" by David Janz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions a synthetic dataset used to demonstrate the model's ability to distinguish valid and invalid sequences. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)** for any additional details about datasets. The introduction discusses generative models and their applications but does not specify any datasets beyond the mention of a synthetic dataset.

Moving on to **section 4 (Results)**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors describe training three recurrent neural networks on different types of data, including sequences of mathematical expressions generated from an alphabet of integers and mathematical symbols. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name or citation for this synthetic dataset.

Since the paper primarily discusses a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments, I will note that the dataset is not a publicly available or formally cited dataset but rather a constructed dataset for the study.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered. The only dataset mentioned is the synthetic dataset used for training the models, which does not have a formal citation. Therefore, I will document this as follows:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences of mathematical expressions generated from an alphabet of integers and mathematical symbols allowable in the Python programming language. It is used to test the validity of sequences as Python code.

Since there are no formal citations for this synthetic dataset, I will note that it is a constructed dataset specific to the experiments in this paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the synthetic dataset.
