To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strategy-Proof Aggregation Rules in Median Semilattices with Applications to Preference Aggregation" by Ernesto Savaglio and Stefano Vannucci, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, applications, or case studies. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

I will also look for a **dedicated section on datasets** if it exists, as this is a common practice in research papers. This section typically outlines the datasets used, their sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or commonly used name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and systematic extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the information presented.
