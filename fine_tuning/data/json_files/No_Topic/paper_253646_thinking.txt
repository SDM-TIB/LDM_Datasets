To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BabelEnconding at SemEval-2020 Task 3: Contextual Similarity as a Combination of Multilingualism and Language Models" by Lucas R. C. Pessutto et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and hints at the datasets used, while the introduction elaborates on the context of the task and its significance.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that the task involves datasets built and annotated in four languages: English, Croatian, Finnish, and Slovenian. This indicates that there are specific datasets relevant to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that they utilized **CoSimLex**, which consists of 340 sentence pairs in English, 112 in Croatian, 111 in Slovene, and 24 in Finnish. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CoSimLex dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Carlos S. Armendariz, Matthew Purver, Senja Pollak, Nikola Ljubeˇsi´c, Matej Ulˇcar, Marko Robnik-ˇSikonja, Ivan Vuli´c, and Mohammad Taher Pilehvar. *CoSimLex: A resource for evaluating graded word similarity in context*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 5878–5886, Marseille, France, May. European Language Resources Association, 2020.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for CoSimLex as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
