To extract datasets from the research paper titled "With Shared Microexponents, A Little Shifting Goes a Long Way" by Bita Rouhani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **WMT-17 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating language translation models. It is referenced in the context of training and testing the models.

2. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training BERT models, specifically mentioned in the context of language understanding tasks.

3. **ImageNet ILSVRC12 Dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks, referenced in the evaluation of various computer vision models.

4. **Librispeech Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of speech recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
