To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trends in the E-commerce and in the Traditional Retail Sectors During the Covid-19 Pandemic: an Evolutionary Game Approach" by Andr√© Barreira da Silva Rocha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Discussion)**, where the authors analyze the traditional retail sector and the e-commerce sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. This section may contain references to datasets used for empirical analysis or simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss numerical simulations and their implications for the e-commerce and traditional retail sectors. I will look for any datasets that were used to support their findings or that are referenced in the context of their simulations.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

As I analyze the paper, I will note any datasets mentioned, along with their descriptions and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to specific datasets or studies, I will ensure to capture the full citation for each.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset related to e-commerce growth rates during the pandemic, I will look for the original source of that data and provide the citation.

Once I have identified all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research and providing valuable resources for future studies.
