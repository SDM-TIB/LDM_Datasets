To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Least-squares registration of point sets over SE(d) using closed-form projections" by Sk. Miraj Ahmed, Niladri Ranjan Das, and Kunal Narayan Chaudhury, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and methods, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments sections** for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss applications of their method in 2D shape matching and 3D multiview registration, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any references to datasets or specific experiments that involve data.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors describe their empirical analysis and mention using scans from the **Stanford repository** for their experiments. This indicates that they utilized specific datasets for their evaluations.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of the experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets used for comparisons with other methods, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the Stanford repository is a well-known dataset, and I will ensure to provide its proper citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections to identify datasets.
2. Note any datasets explicitly mentioned, particularly in the context of experiments.
3. Look for full citations in the References section for each dataset.
4. Compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, for clarity and completeness.
