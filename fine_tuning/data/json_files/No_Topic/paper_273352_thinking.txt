To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-lineage evolution in viral populations driven by host immune systems" by Jacopo Marchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used for analysis or comparison. In this case, the abstract discusses the interaction between viral evolution and host immune systems, which may imply the use of empirical data, but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that might detail the data collection or datasets used in the simulations or analyses. The methods section often contains crucial information about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study. 

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This section may provide insights into the specific datasets used to validate the findings of the research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will ensure to note down their names, descriptions, and the full citations as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
   - **Citation**: Full citation of the dataset as it appears in the references section.

2. **Additional Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
   - **Citation**: Full citation of the dataset as it appears in the references section.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the information is accurate and complete for future reference.
