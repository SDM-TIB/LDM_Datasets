To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainability Tools Enabling Deep Learning in Future In-Situ Real-Time Planetary Explorations" by Daniel Lundstrom et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental results, and analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning for Mars rover tasks, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Mars images.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The introduction provides background on deep learning but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **experimental results section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training the neural network. Here, the authors mention that they trained their model on a dataset of images from the Mars Rover, which consisted of five main categories: close-up rock, distant landscape, drill hole, other rover part, and sun. They specify that there were 1132 training images, 164 validation images, and 153 testing images, which gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's structure.

In the **analysis and discussion section**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's distribution and its relevance to the tasks of the rover. They provide a breakdown of the classes in the training set, which further confirms the details about the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references a dataset related to Mars image classification:

- For the Mars Rover dataset, the citation is:
  > K. Wagstaff, S. Lu, E. Dunkel, K. Grimes, B. Zhao, J. Cai, S. B. Cole, G. Doran, R. Francis, J. H. Lee, and L. Mandrake. *Mars image content classification: Three years of NASA deployment and recent advances*. CoRR, vol. abs/2102.05011, 2021. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05011

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Mars Rover Dataset**: This dataset consists of images categorized into five classes relevant to Mars exploration tasks. The total number of images includes 1132 training images, 164 validation images, and 153 testing images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
