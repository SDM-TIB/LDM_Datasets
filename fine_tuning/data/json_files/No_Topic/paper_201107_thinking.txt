To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Triplet Network with Attention for Speaker Diarization" by Huan Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **CALLHOME conversational speech corpus**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In Section 4.1, the authors discuss the training process and mention that the model was trained on the **TEDLIUM corpus**, which consists of 1495 audio recordings. They also specify that the **CALLHOME corpus** is used for testing the diarization performance.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **CALLHOME Corpus**: This dataset is used for testing the proposed approach. It consists of telephone conversations in six languages and includes 780 transcribed conversations containing 2 to 7 speakers.

2. **TEDLIUM Corpus**: This dataset is used for training the model. It consists of 1495 audio recordings and includes a set of 1211 speakers with an average recording length of 10.2 minutes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **CALLHOME corpus**, the citation is:
  > "CALLHOME: A Corpus of Conversational Speech in English." TalkBank. Available at: https://ca.talkbank.org/access/CallHome/

- For the **TEDLIUM corpus**, the citation is:
  > "TEDLIUM: A Large-Scale Dataset for Speech Recognition." Available at: http://www.openslr.org/19/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will allow me to create structured entries for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
