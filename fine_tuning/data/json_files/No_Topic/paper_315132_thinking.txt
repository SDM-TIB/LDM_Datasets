To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Arabic Diacritization by Learning to Diacritize and Translate" by Brian Thompson and Ali Alshehri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to the **Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors detail their training data, which includes the **Penn Arabic Treebank** and various bitext datasets. They mention using the PATB training subset, which consists of 15,789 lines, and they also refer to additional datasets used for translation tasks.

In the **experiments section**, they list the following datasets:

1. **Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB)**: This dataset is crucial for their diacritization task and is explicitly mentioned as the primary dataset used for evaluation.

2. **Bitext Datasets**: The authors utilize several bitext datasets for training, including:
   - **Wikimatrix**: A massive collection of parallel sentences.
   - **Global Voices**: Another parallel corpus.
   - **United Nations**: A dataset containing multilingual documents.
   - **News Commentary**: A collection of news articles in multiple languages.
   - **CCAligned**: A dataset of cross-lingual web-document pairs.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **Penn Arabic Treebank**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
