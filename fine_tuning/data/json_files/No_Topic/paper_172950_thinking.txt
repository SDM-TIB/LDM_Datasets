To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast, Simple Calcium Imaging Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks" by Aleksander Klibisz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on the Neurofinder competition datasets, which suggests that this is a key dataset to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention the **Neurofinder datasets**, which consist of 60K images with labeled neurons, and they also introduce their own datasets referred to as the **St. Jude datasets**. 

In this section, the authors describe the Neurofinder datasets as containing training and testing data, with specific characteristics such as the number of images and neurons labeled. They also mention that the St. Jude datasets contain GCaMP6f-expressing neurons from the auditory cortex, which is not represented in the Neurofinder datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Neurofinder dataset is referenced as follows:

- **Neurofinder Dataset**: 
  > CodeNeuro.org: The neurofinder challenge. http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org/ (2016).

For the **St. Jude datasets**, since they are introduced by the authors and do not have a separate citation, I will note that they are proprietary datasets created by the authors and do not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Neurofinder Dataset**: A large dataset containing 60K images with 7K labeled neurons, used for training and testing in the Neurofinder competition.
   - Citation: CodeNeuro.org: The neurofinder challenge. http://neurofinder.codeneuro.org/ (2016).

2. **St. Jude Datasets**: Proprietary datasets containing GCaMP6f-expressing neurons from the auditory cortex, used to complement the Neurofinder datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations.
