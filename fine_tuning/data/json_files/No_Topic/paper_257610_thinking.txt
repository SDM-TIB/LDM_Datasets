To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RODE: Learning Roles to Decompose Multi-Agent Tasks" by Tonghan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method is tested on the **StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset or benchmark used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their testing methodology and the environments used. They specifically mention using the **StarCraft II micromanagement (SMAC) benchmark** for their experiments. This benchmark is crucial as it provides the scenarios in which their proposed method is evaluated.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the SMAC benchmark, which is essential for providing a complete citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **StarCraft II Micromanagement Benchmark**: This benchmark is used extensively in the paper for evaluating the proposed method. It consists of various scenarios that test multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

Next, I will find the full citation for the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark. The relevant reference in the paper is:

- For the **StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.04043, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the dataset name and its full citation, ready for any structured output or further processing.
