To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CF-GODE: Continuous-Time Causal Inference for Multi-Agent Dynamical Systems" by Song Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions experiments on "two semi-synthetic datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section 5, where they mention using two real graphs: **Flickr** and **BlogCatalog**. They also refer to a simulation process that generates treatment and potential outcomes based on these graphs.

I will then gather specific details about each dataset:

1. **Flickr Dataset**: This dataset is used as a social network graph for simulating treatment and potential outcomes in the context of multi-agent dynamical systems.

2. **BlogCatalog Dataset**: Similar to the Flickr dataset, this is another social network graph utilized for the same purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following works:

- For the **Flickr dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Lang, K. J., & Mahoney, M. W. (2010). *Empirical comparison of algorithms for network community detection*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 631-640.

- For the **BlogCatalog dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, J., & Leskovec, J. (2012). *Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-truth*. In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Web Science, pages 1-8.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
