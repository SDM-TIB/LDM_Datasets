To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Course of the first month of the COVID-19 outbreak in the New York State counties" by Anca RÄƒdulescu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which includes the evolution of reported infections in New York State. This suggests that there may be datasets related to COVID-19 infections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the differences in infection patterns across various states, hinting at the use of specific datasets for analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the author describes the data sources used for the analysis. The paper mentions using data from the **COVID Tracking Project** and the **Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering**. I will note these sources as they are likely to be key datasets.

In the **results section**, the author presents findings based on the data analyzed. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, particularly those that provide numerical data on infections, testing, and hospitalizations. The paper refers to various counties and their reported infection counts, which indicates that there may be a dataset detailing these figures.

The **discussion section** may also provide insights into the datasets used, especially if the author references any specific data trends or comparisons. I will ensure to capture any additional datasets mentioned here.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the data sources used in the study are crucial for proper attribution.

3. The paper also references population estimates and density data from the **New York State Department of Health**:
   > New York State Department of Health. *Vital Statistics*. Available at: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/vital_statistics/2010/table02.htm. Accessed 04/02/2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
