To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistream Neural Architectures for Cued Speech Recognition Using a Pre-Trained Visual Feature Extractor and Constrained CTC Decoding" by Sanjana Sankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed system is evaluated on an updated version of the French Cued Speech dataset, referred to as **CSF18**. This suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in continuous Automatic Cued Speech Recognition (ACSR) and mention the **CSF18 corpus** as the largest available corpus of Cued Speech data. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about how they extracted visual features from the CSF18 dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. They also mention that the dataset consists of 238 French sentences, which were recorded and processed for their study.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the CSF18 dataset in detail, noting that it has been updated to correct phonetic transcriptions, leading to a new version called **CSF18V2**. They provide specifics about the dataset, including the number of phonetic classes and the nature of the recordings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CSF18 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CSF18**:
  > Li Liu, Thomas Hueber, Gang Feng, and Denis Beautemps. *Visual Recognition of Continuous Cued Speech Using a Tandem CNN-HMM Approach*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2018, pp. 2643â€“2647.

Additionally, the updated version **CSF18V2** is made available with the DOI:
  > DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1206000.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will prepare the dataset information for structured output or further processing.
