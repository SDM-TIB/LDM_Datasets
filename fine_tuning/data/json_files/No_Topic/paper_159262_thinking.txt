To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Limited Solving for Imperfect-Information Games" by Noam Brown et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the context of imperfect-information games and mentions previous work but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section**, particularly **section 6**, which details the experiments conducted. Here, the authors mention two specific games: **heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em (HUNL)** and **heads-up no-limit flop hold’em (NLFH)**. While these are not datasets in the traditional sense, they are benchmarks used for evaluating the performance of the proposed methods.

To ensure I have captured all relevant datasets, I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information regarding datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments. The appendix does not provide any new datasets but reiterates the rules of the poker games used in the experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will note that the primary benchmarks used for evaluation are the games themselves, which are widely recognized in the field of AI and game theory.

Now, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the games mentioned:

1. **Heads-up No-Limit Texas Hold’em (HUNL)**: This is a well-known benchmark in the field of AI for evaluating poker-playing agents. The game rules and structure are standard and widely referenced in literature.
   - Citation: Brown, N., Ganzfried, S., & Sandholm, T. (2017). Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals. *Science*, page eaao1733.

2. **Heads-up No-Limit Flop Hold’em (NLFH)**: Similar to HUNL, this variant is also used as a benchmark for evaluating AI performance in poker.
   - Citation: Brown, N., Ganzfried, S., & Sandholm, T. (2017). Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals. *Science*, page eaao1733.

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide traditional datasets, it utilizes established game formats as benchmarks for evaluation. I will ensure to document these findings clearly, including the citations for the games referenced in the paper.
