To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Behavior Gated Language Models" by Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections**. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on behavior-rich datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 3.1 (Data)**, they explicitly mention two behavior-related datasets:

1. **Couples Therapy Corpus (CoupTher)**: This dataset consists of dyadic conversations between couples seeking marital counseling, including audio, video recordings, and transcriptions. It contains approximately 0.83 million words and is annotated for 33 behaviors.

2. **Cancer Couples Interaction Dataset**: This dataset is derived from an observational study of couples coping with advanced cancer, featuring audio-recorded interactions during structured discussions. It contains approximately 230,000 word tokens.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Penn Tree Bank Corpus** in **subsection 3.1.2** as a more generic language modeling task dataset. This corpus is primarily composed of articles from the Wall Street Journal.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Couples Therapy Corpus**, the citation is:
  > A. Christensen, D.C. Atkins, S. Berns, J. Wheeler, D.H. Baucom, and L.E. Simpson. *Traditional versus integrative behavioral couple therapy for significantly and chronically distressed married couples*. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 72, 2004.

- For the **Cancer Couples Interaction Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maija Reblin, Steven K. Sutton, Susan Vadaparampil, Richard E. Heyman, and Lee Ellington. *Behind closed doors: How advanced cancer couples communicate at home*. Journal of Psychosocial Oncology, 37, 2018.

- For the **Penn Tree Bank Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Mitchell Marcus, Grace Kim, Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz, Robert MacIntyre, Ann Bies, Mark Ferguson, Karen Katz, and Britta Schasberger. *The Penn Treebank: Annotating predicate argument structure*. In Proceedings of the workshop on Human Language Technology, Association for Computational Linguistics, 1994.

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
