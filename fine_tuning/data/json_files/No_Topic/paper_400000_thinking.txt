To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEPAL: Spatial Gene Expression Prediction from Local Graphs" by Gabriel Mejia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on two different human breast cancer datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **10x Genomics breast cancer spatial transcriptomic dataset (Visium)**: This dataset consists of two slide images from a breast tissue sample with invasive ductal carcinoma, containing 3798 and 3987 spots detected under the tissue.

2. **STNet dataset**: This dataset includes 68 slide images of H&E-stained tissue from 23 patients with breast cancer, with a total of 30,612 gene expression data points.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation, which they are.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

For the **10x Genomics breast cancer spatial transcriptomic dataset**, the citation is:
> Patrik L. St˚ahl, Fredrik Salm´en, Sanja Vickovic, Anna Lundmark, Jos´e Fern´andez Navarro, Jens Magnusson, Stefania Giacomello, Michaela Asp, Jakub O. Westholm, Mikael Huss, Annelie Mollbrink, Sten Linnarsson, Simone Codeluppi, Pelin Sahl´en, Jan Mulder, Olaf Bergmann, Joakim Lundeberg, and Jonas Fris´en. *Visualization and analysis of gene expression in tissue sections by spatial transcriptomics*. Science, 353:78–82, 7 2016.

For the **STNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Linnea Stenbeck, Ludvig Bergenstr˚ahle, Joakim Lundeberg, and ˚Ake Borg. *Human breast cancer in situ capturing transcriptomics*. 5, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **10x Genomics breast cancer spatial transcriptomic dataset (Visium)**: Contains two slide images from a breast tissue sample with invasive ductal carcinoma, with 3798 and 3987 spots.
   - Citation: Patrik L. St˚ahl et al. (2016).

2. **STNet dataset**: Comprises 68 slide images of H&E-stained tissue from 23 patients with breast cancer, totaling 30,612 gene expression data points.
   - Citation: Linnea Stenbeck et al. (2021).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are correctly formatted for future use.
