To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Runtime analysis of the (Âµ + 1)-EA on the Dynamic BinVal function" by Johannes Lengler and Simone Riedi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of instances, types of data, or any specific configurations used in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it will likely contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant metrics or statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Dynamic BinVal," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I will also verify if there are any standard citations associated with it.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a clear and organized summary of the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
