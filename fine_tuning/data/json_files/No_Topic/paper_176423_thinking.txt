To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mining Object Parts from CNNs via Active Question-Answering" by Quanshi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors used "three benchmark datasets" for testing their method, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section 5.2 (Datasets)**. Here, they list the datasets used for testing their method:

1. **PASCAL VOC Part Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for part localization studies. 

2. **CUB200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset contains images of 200 bird species and is used for part localization performance evaluation.

3. **ILSVRC 2013 DET Animal-Part Dataset**: This dataset consists of 30 animal categories and is also used for part localization tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PASCAL VOC Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Chen, R. Mottaghi, X. Liu, S. Fidler, R. Urtasun, and A. Yuille. *Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts*. In CVPR, 2014.

- For the **CUB200-2011 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

- For the **ILSVRC 2013 DET Animal-Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. In IJCV, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations, which is crucial for any downstream processing or documentation.
