To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Optimal Decision-Making in Ant Colonies" by Mahnush Movahedi and Mahdi Zamani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets referenced in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the decision-making behavior of ant colonies but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it references laboratory results from Pratt et al., which may indicate the use of experimental data.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets or experiments. The introduction discusses models of collective decision-making and references previous studies, particularly the work of Marshall et al. and Pratt et al. I will note that Pratt et al. is mentioned multiple times, suggesting that their work may involve datasets relevant to the study of ant decision-making.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments or simulations. The paper describes a model based on the work of Pratt et al. and discusses the transition behaviors of ants, but it does not provide explicit details about datasets. I will need to check the **references** section to find the original studies cited, particularly those by Pratt et al. and Marshall et al., as they may contain the datasets used in this research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the relevant studies mentioned in the paper:

1. For the study by Pratt et al. that discusses the house-hunting behavior of ants, the citation is:
   > S. C. Pratt, E. B. Mallon, D. J. Sumpter, and N. R. Franks. *Quorum sensing, recruitment, and collective decision-making during colony emigration by the ant Leptothorax albipennis*. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 52(2):117–127, 2002.

2. For the study by Marshall et al. that the authors critique, the citation is:
   > J. Marshall, R. Bogacz, A. Dornhaus, R. Planqué, T. Kovacs, and N. Franks. *On optimal decision-making in brains and social insect colonies*. Journal of the Royal Society, Interface / the Royal Society, 6(40):1065–1074, 2009.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets but relies on the findings of these referenced studies, I will note that the datasets are likely contained within the original papers by Pratt et al. and Marshall et al. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to document the datasets based on the citations from the references section. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary information for any datasets referenced in the context of the research paper.
