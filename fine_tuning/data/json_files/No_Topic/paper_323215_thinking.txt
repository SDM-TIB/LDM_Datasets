To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-modal application: Image Memes Generation" by Zhiyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper, as these sections typically contain information about datasets used in the research. In the introduction, the authors discuss the context of meme generation but do not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection **3.1 (Meme Template Selection Model)**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ISEAR Dataset**: This dataset is produced by The International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions, which is referenced as a balanced dataset. However, the authors do not provide a detailed description or citation in this section.

2. **DailyDialog Dataset**: This dataset is described as a manually labeled multi-turn dialogue dataset provided by Yanran Li. The authors mention that they chose this dataset for their project due to its relevance to meme generation.

In order to provide full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **ISEAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klaus R. Scherer and Harald G. Wallbott. 1994. Evidence for universality and cultural variation of differential emotion response patterning. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 66(2):310.

- For the **DailyDialog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yanran Li, Hui Su, Xiaoyu Shen, Wenjie Li, Ziqiang Cao, and Shuzi Niu. 2017. DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ISEAR Dataset**: A balanced dataset produced by The International Survey on Emotion Antecedents and Reactions.
   - Citation: Scherer, K. R., & Wallbott, H. G. (1994). Evidence for universality and cultural variation of differential emotion response patterning. *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 66(2), 310.

2. **DailyDialog Dataset**: A manually labeled multi-turn dialogue dataset relevant to meme generation.
   - Citation: Li, Y., Su, H., Shen, X., Li, W., Cao, Z., & Niu, S. (2017). DailyDialog: A manually labelled multi-turn dialogue dataset. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.03957*.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
