To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Self-supervised and Weight-preserving Neural Architecture Search" by Zhuowei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, which are both well-known datasets for image classification tasks. They also mention **ImageNet** in section 4.2, confirming its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. rep., 2009. [Link to CIFAR-10/100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. [DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
