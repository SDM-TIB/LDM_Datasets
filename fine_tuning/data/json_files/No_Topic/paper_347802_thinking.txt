To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaNi: Maximizing Mutual Information for Nuclei Cross-Domain Unsupervised Segmentation" by Yash Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple datasets comprising over 20 cancer-type domain shifts, indicating that there are several datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the TCIA repository and contains 486 images of size 400 × 400 pixels.

2. **Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cell (TNBC) dataset**: Also from the TCIA repository, this dataset includes 50 images of size 512 × 512 pixels.

3. **Stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) dataset**: This dataset consists of 99 images of size 256 × 256 pixels, also sourced from the TCIA repository.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **CoNSep dataset** for nuclei instance segmentation and the **PanNuke dataset**, which comprises 19 cancer types, for their experiments. The CoNSep dataset is referenced in the context of nuclei instance segmentation tasks, while the PanNuke dataset is used as the target domain for UDA.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **KIRC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hou, L., Gupta, R., Van Arnam, J.S., Zhang, Y., Sivalenka, K., Samaras, D., Kurc, T.M., Saltz, J.H. "Dataset of segmented nuclei in hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology images of ten cancer types." *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 1–12, 2020.

- For the **TNBC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irshad, H., Montaser-Kouhsari, L., Waltz, G., Bucur, O., Nowak, J., Dong, F., Knoblauch, N.W., Beck, A.H. "Crowdsourcing image annotation for nucleus detection and segmentation in computational pathology." In: *Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing*, pp. 294–305, World Scientific, 2014.

- For the **STAD dataset**, the citation is the same as for the KIRC dataset, as they are both part of the TCIA repository.

- For the **CoNSep dataset**, the citation is:
  > Graham, S., Vu, Q.D., Raza, S.E.A., Azam, A., Tsang, Y.W., Kwak, J.T., Rajpoot, N. "Hover-net: Simultaneous segmentation and classification of nuclei in multi-tissue histology images." *Medical Image Analysis*, 58, 101563, 2019.

- For the **PanNuke dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gamper, J., Koohbanani, N.A., Benet, K., Khuram, A., Rajpoot, N. "PanNuke: an open pan-cancer histology dataset for nuclei instance segmentation and classification." In: *European Congress on Digital Pathology*, pp. 11–19, Springer, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
