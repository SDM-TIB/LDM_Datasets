To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Adversarial Examples Based on Spatial Consistency Information for Semantic Segmentation" by Chaowei Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention conducting experiments on two datasets: **Cityscapes** and **BDD100K**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and likely contain relevant information for my extraction.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they applied both **Cityscapes** and **BDD100K** datasets in their evaluation, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I find are:

- For **Cityscapes**:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) (pp. 3213â€“3223).

- For **BDD100K**:
  > Yu, F., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Liao, M., Madhavan, V., & Darrell, T. (2018). BDD100K: A diverse driving video database with scalable annotation tooling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Cityscapes**: A dataset designed for semantic urban scene understanding, containing high-resolution images with instance-level annotations.
2. **BDD100K**: A diverse driving video dataset that includes a wide range of driving scenarios and is annotated for various tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
