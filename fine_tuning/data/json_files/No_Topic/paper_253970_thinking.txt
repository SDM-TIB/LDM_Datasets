To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FOCAL: A Forgery Localization Framework based on Video Coding Self-Consistency" by Sebastiano Verde et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the framework was validated in two typical forgery scenarios: temporal and spatial splicing. This indicates that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments and results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they detail the generation of the testing dataset, which is split into two parts: one for temporal splicing and one for spatial splicing.

1. **Dataset D**: This dataset consists of encoded videos generated from five uncompressed videos. The authors mention that each video was encoded with different codecs and qualities, resulting in a total of 60 encoded videos or 12,600 frames.

2. **Dataset Dtemp**: This dataset is specifically for temporal splicing localization. It was created by splicing the first 100 frames of each video in Dataset D with the second 100 frames of any other video in the same set. This results in 330 temporally-spliced videos, corresponding to 66,000 frames.

3. **Dataset Dspat**: This dataset is for spatial splicing localization. It was generated by substituting a CIF window of each video in Dataset D with the same window from another video in the same set. This also results in 330 spatially-spliced videos, corresponding to 66,000 frames and 1,452,000 patches.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned in the **References section**. The authors reference the REWIND dataset, which is used for testing the algorithm on realistic scenarios involving photo-realistic forgeries.

- For **REWIND dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bestagini, P., Milani, S., & Tubaro, S. (2013). Local tampering detection in video sequences. In 2013 IEEE 15th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) (pp. 488-493). doi:10.1109/MMSP.2013.6290214.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
