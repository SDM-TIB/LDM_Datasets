To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring the Measuring Tools: An Automatic Evaluation of Semantic Metrics for Text Corpora" by George Kour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating semantic similarity metrics, which may hint at the datasets used for this evaluation.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Known Similarity Corpora)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset contains utterances to a flight booking system, with a total of 4,978 samples.
2. **Yahoo Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20,000 Yahoo non-factoid questions.
3. **clinc150 Dataset**: This dataset includes 22,500 utterances classified into 150 classes across 10 domains.
4. **Banking77 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 10,000 online banking queries.

In this section, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset, which is essential for understanding their context and relevance to the study.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Charles T. Hemphill, John J. Godfrey, and George R. Doddington. *The ATIS Spoken Language Systems Pilot Corpus*. In Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hid-den Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For the **Yahoo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yinuo Guo, Chong Ruan, and Junfeng Hu. *Meteor++: Incorporating Copy Knowledge into Machine Translation Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Shared Task Papers, pages 740–745, 2018.

- For the **clinc150 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stefan Larson, Anish Mahendran, Joseph J Peper, Christopher Clarke, Andrew Lee, Parker Hill, Jonathan K Kummerfeld, Kevin Leach, Michael A Laurenzano, Lingjia Tang, et al. *An Evaluation Dataset for Intent Classification and Out-of-Scope Prediction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.02027, 2019.

- For the **Banking77 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iñigo Casanueva, Tadas Temcinas, and Matthew Henderson. *Efficient Sentence Encoders*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.04807, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
