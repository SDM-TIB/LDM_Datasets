To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Comparison of Machine Learning Packages on the Edges" by Xingzhou Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses evaluating machine learning packages but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on the performance of various machine learning frameworks without naming datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experimental methods section** closely, particularly the parts that describe the machine learning models used for evaluation. The authors mention using **AlexNet** and **SqueezeNet** as the models for their experiments. However, I need to check if these models are associated with specific datasets for training or evaluation.

In the **results and discussions section**, the authors discuss the performance of these models on various edge devices but do not specify the datasets used for training these models. They mention that the models were downloaded from official websites, which implies that they are using pre-trained models rather than datasets they created or collected themselves.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets used for training or evaluation, I will look into the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. However, the references primarily cite papers related to the machine learning frameworks and models rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. They focused on the performance of machine learning packages rather than on specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that there are no datasets extracted from this paper, as the authors did not provide any specific dataset names or details. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since none were identified in the text.
