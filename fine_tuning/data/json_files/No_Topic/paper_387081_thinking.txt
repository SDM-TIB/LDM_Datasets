To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigating Fairness in AI Radiology: Concepts, Consequences, and Crucial Considerations" by Vasantha Kumar Venugopal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing the Aequitas toolkit** and its application in radiology. The abstract mentions the use of the Aequitas toolkit for bias auditing, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **section discussing the Aequitas toolkit** (section 4). Here, the authors describe the toolkit's functionality and its application in auditing AI models. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors reference as being used with the Aequitas toolkit.

In the **hypothetical scenarios section (section 7)**, the authors present two scenarios related to tuberculosis screening and lung cancer screening. I will check if they mention any specific datasets or sources of data used to illustrate the impact of bias in these scenarios.

After reviewing these sections, I will compile a list of any datasets mentioned, ensuring to note their context and relevance to the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies referenced in the paper. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for each dataset.

If the authors refer to specific datasets or studies, I will extract the relevant citations. For example, if they mention a dataset related to tuberculosis screening, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset identified in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the context of fairness in AI radiology.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations as presented in the research paper.
