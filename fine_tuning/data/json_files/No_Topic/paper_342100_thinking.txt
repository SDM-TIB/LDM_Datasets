To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework to Map VMAF with the Probability of Just Noticeable Difference between Video Encoding Recipes" by Jingwen Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for large-scale JND ground truth data, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to several subjective studies and datasets related to Just Noticeable Difference (JND), indicating that multiple datasets may be discussed. I will note any dataset names or references provided.

Next, I will focus on the **methodologies section**, particularly the subsection on subjective studies. Here, the authors describe a two-direction JND search and mention that they collected a JND dataset using this method. I will look for specific details about this dataset, including its size, characteristics, and how it was collected.

The authors also mention the use of the **JND VideoSet** in their experiments. I will gather details about this dataset, including its size and the types of videos it contains.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results based on the datasets mentioned earlier. This section may contain additional insights or confirmations about the datasets used.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The references will provide the necessary details to accurately cite the datasets.

Based on my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **JND Dataset**: This dataset was collected using a novel two-direction JND search subjective protocol. It includes various video stimuli and is annotated with subjective DCR ratings.

2. **JND VideoSet**: A large-scale dataset containing 220 5-second source reference clips in 4 resolutions, labeled with the first, second, and third JND.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references:

- For the **JND VideoSet**, the citation is:
  > H. Wang, I. Katsavounidis, J. Zhou, J. Park, S. Lei, X. Zhou, M.-O. Pun, X. Jin, R. Wang, X. Wang et al., “Videoset: A large-scale compressed video quality dataset based on jnd measurement,” Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation, vol. 46, pp. 292–302, 2017.

The JND dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, as it is a novel dataset created by the authors of this paper. Therefore, I will note it as an internal dataset created for the study.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
