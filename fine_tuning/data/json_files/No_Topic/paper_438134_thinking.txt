To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Feature Gaussian Processes for Single-Scene Aerosol Optical Depth Reconstruction" by Shengjie Liu and Lu Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two AOD datasets** with real-world cloud patterns, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or names of the datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of aerosol optical depth (AOD) reconstruction and mentions the use of satellite data, but it does not specify the datasets yet.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **MODIS AOD Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD products (MCD19A2) over Los Angeles. It includes 65,793 valid samples from an almost cloud-free scene on September 13, 2018, and a cloudy date from August 24, 2018, with 53,540 training and 12,253 testing pixels.

2. **EMIT AOD Dataset**: This dataset comes from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) instrument onboard the International Space Station (ISS). It has a spatial resolution of 60 m and includes a cloud-free scene from August 19, 2023, over Beijing, with a size of 570×1,040 pixels, containing 367,189 training pixels and 225,611 testing pixels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The MODIS AOD dataset is referenced in the context of previous studies, and I will look for the original source of the MODIS AOD products. The EMIT dataset is also mentioned in the references, and I will find the appropriate citation for it.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **MODIS AOD Dataset**:
  > C. Li et al., “Retrieval, validation, and application of the 1-km aerosol optical depth from MODIS measurements over Hong Kong,” IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., vol. 43, no. 11, pp. 2650–2658, 2005.

- For the **EMIT AOD Dataset**:
  > R. O. Green et al., “Performance and early results from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) imaging spectroscopy mission,” in 2023 IEEE Aerospace Conference, IEEE, 2023, pp. 1–10.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
