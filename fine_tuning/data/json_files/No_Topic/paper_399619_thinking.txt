To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Warm-Start Fixed-Point Optimization Algorithms" by Rajiv Sambharya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a machine-learning framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments conducted. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention applying their framework to various applications, including control, statistics, and signal processing. I will look for specific datasets used in these applications. If they provide any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, I will pay special attention to those as they often contain concise information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **EMNIST dataset** for image deblurring, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation for the EMNIST dataset is:
> Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373*.

If they mention datasets related to optimization problems, I would similarly find the relevant citations for those datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets referenced in the paper.
