To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Neural Decompilation" by Omer Katz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a framework for decompilation, which suggests that datasets might be involved in training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using randomly generated C snippets as a dataset for training their decompiler. They also refer to a specific grammar for generating these snippets, which indicates a structured dataset.

I will also check the **evaluation section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide details about the training and validation datasets. The paper states that they generated 10,000 training samples and 1,000 validation samples, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves, there may not be external citations for them. Instead, I will note the methodology used to create these datasets.

The key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **Training Dataset**: Composed of 10,000 random C code snippets generated from a defined grammar.
2. **Validation Dataset**: Composed of 1,000 random C code snippets, also generated from the same grammar.
3. **Test Dataset**: Composed of 2,000 random C code snippets used for evaluating the decompiler's performance.

Since these datasets are generated by the authors and do not have external citations, I will document them as follows:

- For the **Training Dataset**:
  > Katz, O., Goldberg, Y., Olshaker, Y., & Yahav, E. (2023). *Towards Neural Decompilation*. Training dataset of 10,000 random C code snippets generated from a defined grammar.

- For the **Validation Dataset**:
  > Katz, O., Goldberg, Y., Olshaker, Y., & Yahav, E. (2023). *Towards Neural Decompilation*. Validation dataset of 1,000 random C code snippets generated from a defined grammar.

- For the **Test Dataset**:
  > Katz, O., Goldberg, Y., Olshaker, Y., & Yahav, E. (2023). *Towards Neural Decompilation*. Test dataset of 2,000 random C code snippets generated from a defined grammar.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation.
