To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalizable Referring Image Segmentation via Target Prompt and Visual Coherence" by Yajie Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention four widely-used datasets for referring image segmentation:

1. **RefCOCO**: This dataset is collected using the ReferitGame and focuses on referring expressions with no restrictions on the language used.
2. **RefCOCO+**: Similar to RefCOCO, but it restricts the use of location words in the expressions.
3. **RefCOCOg**: This dataset contains longer and more complex descriptions collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk.
4. **ReferIt**: Collected from the ImageCLEF IAPR dataset, it contains a significant number of categories not present in the RefCOCO series.

The authors also mention a new dataset they generated called **GraspNet-RIS**, which consists of referring expressions generated for a subset of images from the GraspNet dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **RefCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14* (pp. 69–85).

- For **RefCOCO+**, the citation is the same as RefCOCO since it is a variant of the same dataset:
  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A. C., & Berg, T. L. (2016). Modeling context in referring expressions. In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part II 14* (pp. 69–85).

- For **RefCOCOg**, the citation is:
  > Mao, J., Huang, J., Toshev, A., Camburu, O., Yuille, A. L., & Murphy, K. (2016). Generation and comprehension of unambiguous object descriptions. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 11–20).

- For **ReferIt**, the citation is:
  > Kazemzade, S., Ordonez, V., & Matten, M. (2014). Referring to objects in photographs of natural scenes. In *Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* (Vol. 28, pp. 787–789).

- For **GraspNet-RIS**, the citation is:
  > Fang, H.-S., Wang, C., Gou, M., & Lu, C. (2020). Graspnet-1billion: A large-scale benchmark for general object grasping. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 11 444–11 453).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
