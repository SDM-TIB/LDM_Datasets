To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Identify the Cobb Angle in Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis Based on Lumbosacral Joint Efforts During Gait," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves thirty participants with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and their gait cycles, which suggests that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically the **Dataset subsection**. Here, the authors mention that thirty AIS participants with specific Cobb angle measurements were included in the study. This section provides critical details about the dataset, including the characteristics of the participants (Cobb angle, age, weight, height) and the longitudinal nature of the dataset, which started in 2009.

I will also look for any references to previous studies that may have contributed to the dataset or provided context for its use. The authors reference a previous study that calculated lumbosacral joint efforts, which may indicate that the dataset has been used in other research as well.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their machine learning models, which were trained on the dataset. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related studies mentioned. The paper references several studies that may provide context or additional datasets related to the Cobb angle and gait analysis in scoliosis.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Dataset of Thirty AIS Participants**: This dataset includes measurements of Cobb angles, age, weight, and height of participants, and it is used to train machine learning algorithms for predicting the Cobb angle based on lumbosacral joint efforts during gait.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Samadi, B., Raison, M., Achiche, S., & Fortin, C. (2020). Identification of the most relevant intervertebral effort indicators during gait of adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis. *Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin*, 1-11. https://doi.org/10.1080/10255842.2020.1758075.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
