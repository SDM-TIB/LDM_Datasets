To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DOA Estimation with Non-Uniform Linear Arrays: A Phase-Difference Projection Approach" by Hui Chen, Tarig Ballal, and Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new algorithm for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **performance evaluation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for simulations or experiments. In this case, the authors mention two array configurations: **r1** and **r2**. They describe these configurations in detail, indicating that they are derived from existing datasets.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or configurations mentioned. The authors refer to specific setups from previous works, which may not be datasets in the traditional sense but rather configurations used in their simulations. 

The citations for the array configurations are as follows:

1. For **r1** configuration:
   > Y. Li, X. Zou, B. Luo, W. Pan, L. Yan, and P. Liu. "A 2q-order difference-set approach to eliminate phase ambiguity of a single-frequency signal." *IEEE Signal Processing Letters*, vol. 26, no. 10, pp. 1526–1530, 2019.

2. For **r2** configuration:
   > E. Vertatschitsch and S. Haykin. "Nonredundant arrays." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 74, no. 1, pp. 217–217, 1986.

Now that I have identified the configurations and their citations, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Array Configuration r1**: This configuration is derived from the work of Li et al. (2019) and consists of a specific arrangement of antennas used for DOA estimation.

- **Array Configuration r2**: This configuration is based on the non-redundant array concept discussed by Vertatschitsch and Haykin (1986), which is also utilized in the simulations for DOA estimation.

Finally, I will compile these entries into a structured format for clarity and ensure that each dataset is properly cited with full references. This will allow for accurate attribution and further exploration of the datasets used in the research.
