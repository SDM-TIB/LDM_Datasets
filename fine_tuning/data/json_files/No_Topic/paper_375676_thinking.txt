To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M-Tuning: Prompt Tuning with Mitigated Label Bias in Open-Set Scenarios" by Ning Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention several datasets in the context of their experiments. I will note down each dataset's name, description, and any relevant details provided.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **CIFAR+10**: A variant of CIFAR10 where 4 classes are known and 10 classes are unknown.
4. **CIFAR+50**: Another variant where 4 classes are known and 50 classes are unknown.
5. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 200 classes and 500 training images per class.
6. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet with 100 known classes and 900 unknown classes.
7. **ImageNet-200**: Another subset with 200 known classes and 800 unknown classes.
8. **ImageNet-LT**: A long-tailed version of ImageNet with varying numbers of samples per class.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citation for CIFAR10 is:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

Similarly, I will find and note down the citations for the other datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
