To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Sample Complexity of End-to-end Training vs. Semantic Abstraction Training" by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Amnon Shashua, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the comparison between end-to-end training and semantic abstraction training, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the theoretical aspects of training approaches rather than specific datasets, so I will continue to the **main results section**. Here, the authors discuss sample complexity and validation tasks, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Since the paper seems to be more theoretical and does not explicitly mention datasets used for experiments, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. I will look for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the topics discussed in this paper.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations that may relate to datasets in the context of autonomous driving and machine learning:

1. **Deepdriving Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Chenyi Chen, Ari Seff, Alain Kornhauser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *Deepdriving: Learning affordance for direct perception in autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 2722â€“2730, 2015.

2. **ALVINN Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Dean A Pomerleau. *Alvinn: An autonomous land vehicle in a neural network*. Technical report, DTIC Document, 1989.

These references suggest datasets that are relevant to the paper's discussion on autonomous driving and training methodologies.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations. Since the paper does not provide specific datasets used in experiments, I will focus on the datasets mentioned in the references that are pertinent to the topic.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for proper attribution.
