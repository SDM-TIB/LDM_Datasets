To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Machine Learned Quantum-Mechanical Force Fields for Biomolecular Simulations" by Oliver T. Unke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) for molecular dynamics simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to molecular fragments or reference data used for training these models.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the construction of fragment data and the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used for training the MLFFs.

In the **Materials and Methods**, the authors mention the generation of both bottom-up and top-down fragments. They state that they used a total of **2,713,986 bottom-up fragments** and **45,948 top-down fragments** for training their models. This indicates that these fragments are part of the datasets utilized in their research.

I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets or specific studies that provided the reference data for training the MLFFs. The authors mention that they performed DFT calculations on these fragments, which implies that the results from these calculations serve as the reference data for the ML models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies mentioned. For instance, the authors refer to the use of the **Amber99SB-ILDN force field** for conventional molecular dynamics simulations, which is a well-known dataset in the field.

Here are the datasets I have identified:

1. **Bottom-up fragments dataset**: 
   - Citation: Unke, O. T., & Meuwly, M. (2019). *Solvated protein fragments data set*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2605371

2. **Top-down fragments dataset**: 
   - Citation: Unke, O. T., & Meuwly, M. (2021). *SpookyNet: Learning force fields with electronic degrees of freedom and nonlocal effects*. Nature Communications, 12, 7273. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27569-5

3. **Density Functional Theory (DFT) reference data**: 
   - Citation: Parrish, R. M., et al. (2017). *Psi4 1.1: An open-source electronic structure program emphasizing automation, advanced libraries, and interoperability*. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 13(7), 3185-3197. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00169

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
