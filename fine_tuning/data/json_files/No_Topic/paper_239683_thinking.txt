To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual-Inertial Telepresence for Aerial Manipulation" by Jongseok Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a telepresence system that utilizes an object tracking algorithm and a pre-generated object database, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or databases that were utilized in their experiments. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting field experiments and refer to a "pre-generated object database" for their object localization approach. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for this database within the text. This indicates that I need to look further into the **references section** to find any relevant citations that may correspond to the datasets or databases they used.

Upon reviewing the **references**, I will look for any entries that mention datasets or databases related to object tracking or telepresence systems. If the authors refer to specific datasets in their citations, I will extract those details.

For the **object database**, I will note that it is mentioned as a "pre-generated object database" but lacks a specific citation in the text. Therefore, I will need to acknowledge this in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the datasets or databases mentioned in the references. If no specific dataset citations are provided, I will note that the dataset is referenced but not explicitly cited.

Now, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Pre-generated Object Database**: This is mentioned in the context of the object localization approach but lacks a specific citation in the paper. I will note this as a dataset used in the experiments.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citation format for the paper itself, which will be important for referencing the datasets accurately.

The citation for the paper is:
> Jongseok Lee, Ribin Balachandran, Yuri S. Sarkisov, Marco De Stefano, Andre Coelho, Kashmira Shinde, Min Jun Kim, Rudolph Triebel, and Konstantin Kondak. *Visual-Inertial Telepresence for Aerial Manipulation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
