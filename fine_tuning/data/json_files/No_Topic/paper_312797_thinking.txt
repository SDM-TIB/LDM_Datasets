To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Panoptic Narrative Grounding" by Cristina González et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **MS COCO dataset** for transferring annotations, which indicates that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** more closely. Here, the authors discuss the importance of various datasets in the context of visual grounding tasks. They mention **Localized Narratives**, which is a dataset that provides annotations for MS COCO, Flickr30k, and ADE20K. This suggests that these datasets are also relevant to the study.

In the **related work section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of several datasets used in vision and language tasks. I will note down the datasets mentioned here, including:

1. **MS COCO Captions**: This dataset is highlighted for its extensive collection of images and captions.
2. **Visual Genome**: A dataset that connects vision and language with dense annotations.
3. **Flickr30k Entities**: This dataset extends the original Flickr30k dataset with bounding box annotations.
4. **Localized Narratives**: A dataset that provides synchronized voice recordings and mouse traces for visual grounding.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **MS COCO Captions**:
  > Xinlei Chen, Hao Fang, Tsung-Yi Lin, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Saurabh Gupta, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO captions: Data collection and evaluation server*. arXiv:1504.00325, 2015.

- **Visual Genome**:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. IJCV, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

- **Flickr30k Entities**:
  > Bryan A. Plummer, Liwei Wang, Christopher M. Cervantes, Juan C. Caicedo, Julia Hockenmaier, and Svetlana Lazebnik. *Flickr30k Entities: Collecting region-to-phrase correspondences for richer image-to-sentence models*. IJCV, 123(1):74–93, 2017.

- **Localized Narratives**:
  > Jordi Pont-Tuset, Jasper Uijlings, Soravit Changpinyo, Radu Soricut, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Connecting vision and language with localized narratives*. In ECCV, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for clarity and proper referencing. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or details in the paper.
