To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streaming Generalized Canonical Polyadic Tensor Decompositions" by Eric Phipps, Nick Johnson, and Tamara G. Kolda, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions demonstrating the utility and performance of the approach on several synthetic and real tensor datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In section 6.1 (Synthetic Data Experiments), the authors describe two synthetic datasets:
1. **Synthetic Gaussian Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a random K-tensor with specific dimensions and noise added. The details include the size of the tensor and the method of generation.
2. **Synthetic Poisson Dataset**: This dataset is created using a procedure that generates a sparse tensor with specified dimensions and sparsity.

In section 6.2 (Realistic Data Experiments), the authors mention two real datasets:
1. **NYC Taxicab Dataset**: This dataset is derived from New York City Yellow Taxi data from 2018, capturing various fields related to taxi rides.
2. **Chicago Crime Dataset**: This dataset is converted to a binary tensor representing crime occurrences in different neighborhoods over time.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed for datasets, especially if they are derived from publicly available sources, but I will look for any relevant papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For the **NYC Taxicab Dataset**, I will cite:
> New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission. *TLC Trip Record Data*. Available online: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page. Accessed: 2020-11-10.

For the **Chicago Crime Dataset**, I will cite:
> FROSTT. *Chicago Crime Data*. Available online: http://frostt.io/. Accessed: 2020-11-10.

For the **Synthetic Gaussian and Poisson Datasets**, since they are generated by the authors, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the experiments and do not have formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
