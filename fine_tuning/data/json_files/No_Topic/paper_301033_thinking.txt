To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LyricJam: A system for generating lyrics for live instrumental music" by Olga Vechtomova, Gaurav Sahu, and Dhruv Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "training dataset" used for the model, which suggests that there is a specific dataset that I need to locate.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **evaluation section**. Here, the authors state that they trained their system on an "aligned lyric-music dataset created by Vechtomova, Sahu, and Kumar (2020)," which consists of 18,000 WAV audio clips of original songs and their corresponding lyrics by seven music artists. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for the research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Vechtomova, O., Sahu, G., & Kumar, D. (2020). Generation of lyrics lines conditioned on music audio clips. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on NLP for Music and Audio (NLP4MusA), 33â€“37. Online: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Aligned Lyric-Music Dataset**: This dataset consists of 18,000 WAV audio clips of original songs and their corresponding lyrics by seven music artists.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution.
