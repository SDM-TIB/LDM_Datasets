To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Agents without Rewards" by Brendon Matusch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a diverse dataset of agent behavior, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **Background section**, where the authors discuss the environments and agents used in their experiments. They mention using three Atari games (Breakout, Seaquest, and Montezuma's Revenge) and the Minecraft Treechop environment. This is a clear indication that these environments are part of the datasets they utilized.

In the **Method section**, the authors provide details about the datasets collected from various agents in these environments. They mention that they collected a total of over 2 billion time steps of agent experience across these environments, which further confirms the presence of datasets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following datasets:

1. **Atari Learning Environment**: 
   > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., and Bowling, M. "The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents." *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47:253â€“279, 2013.

2. **MineRL Dataset**: 
   > Guss, W. H., Houghton, B., Topin, N., Wang, P., Codel, C., Veloso, M., and Salakhutdinov, R. "MineRL: A large-scale dataset of Minecraft demonstrations." *Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence*, 2019. URL: http://minerl.io.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Atari Games Dataset**: This dataset includes data collected from three Atari games: Breakout, Seaquest, and Montezuma's Revenge, which are used to evaluate the performance of various reinforcement learning agents.

2. **Minecraft Treechop Dataset**: This dataset consists of agent behavior data collected from the Minecraft Treechop environment, where agents are tasked with collecting wood blocks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or analysis.
