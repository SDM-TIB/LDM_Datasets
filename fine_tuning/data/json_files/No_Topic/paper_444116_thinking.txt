To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SRViT: Vision Transformers for Estimating Radar Reflectivity from Satellite Observations at Scale" by Jason Stock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of observational data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) product, indicating that these are likely datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Preliminaries)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Data Composition)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention that the study uses observational data from the GOES-R Series satellites and the MRMS product. They also provide specifics about the data collection period (2018-2022) and the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **GOES-R Series Data**: This includes ABI infrared channels and GLM data, which are used as input for the model.
2. **Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Product**: This is the target dataset for radar reflectivity, which combines information from various radar networks and surface observations.

I will also check the **Appendices** for any additional dataset details. Appendix A provides further insights into the variables and properties of the datasets used, confirming the importance of the MRMS product and the GOES data.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **GOES-R Series Data**, I will reference:
  > Schmit, T., Gunshor, M., Fu, G., Rink, T., Bah, K., and Wolf, W. "GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for: Cloud and Moisture Imagery Product (CMIP), Version 2.3." NOAA NESDIS STAR Document, pp. 66, 2010.

- For the **Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Product**, the citation is:
  > Smith, T. M., Lakshmanan, V., Stumpf, G. J., Ortega, K. L., Hondl, K., Cooper, K., Calhoun, K. M., Kingfield, D. M., Manross, K. L., Toomey, R., et al. "Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) Severe Weather and Aviation Products: Initial Operating Capabilities." Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 97(9):1617â€“1630, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
