To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory-Augmented Theory of Mind Network" by Dung Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new theory of mind model and mentions a "new suite of experiments," which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to look for specific datasets used in the evaluation of the proposed model. The authors describe a "multi-light-room environment" created using the gym-minigrid framework, which indicates that this environment is likely a dataset or a simulation used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or environments. The authors mention that they created a multi-light-room environment for studying ToM models, which is a significant detail. I will also check if they reference any existing datasets or benchmarks used for comparison.

I will then consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or environments mentioned. The authors reference the gym-minigrid framework, which is crucial for understanding the experimental setup. The citation for this framework is:

- Chevalier Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). *Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym*. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of theory of mind tasks or cognitive load assessments. If the authors refer to any established benchmarks or datasets in cognitive science or AI, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all citations are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
