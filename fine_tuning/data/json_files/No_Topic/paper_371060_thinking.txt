To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Shaping: Enhancing Backdoor Attack Against Reverse Engineering" by Rui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using three public datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **GTSRB**. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as the number of training and testing samples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the datasets used, which confirms the datasets and their respective sample sizes. This is crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278-2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

3. **GTSRB Dataset**:
   > J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. "Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition." *Neural Networks*, vol. 32, pp. 323-332, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
