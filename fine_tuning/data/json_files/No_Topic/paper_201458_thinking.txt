To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Occlusion Resistant Object Rotation Regression from Point Cloud Segments" by Ge Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to look for specific dataset names or references in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 6D pose estimation and mention various methods, but they do not explicitly name any datasets. I will need to continue to the experimental results section for more concrete information.

In **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, the authors state that they used the **YCB video dataset** for training and testing their method. They provide details about this dataset, including that it contains 133,827 frames of 21 objects with 6D pose annotations, and also mention an extension with 80,000 frames of synthetic data.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YCB video dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Xiang, Y., Schmidt, T., Narayanan, V., & Fox, D. (2018). *PoseCNN: A Convolutional Neural Network for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Cluttered Scenes*. In Proceedings of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS).

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the YCB video dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset entry for this paper.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
