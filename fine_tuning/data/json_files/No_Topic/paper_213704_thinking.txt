To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InfoMask: Masked Variational Latent Representation to Localize Chest Disease" by Saeid Asgari Taghanaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on the **ChestX-ray8 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for evaluation. Here, they mention the **NIH ChestX-ray8 Dataset**, which comprises 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients, specifically focusing on pneumonia images for training, validation, and testing.

In this section, the authors specify the number of images used for training (20,547), validation (2,568), and testing (2,569), which provides a clear understanding of how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ChestX-ray8 dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **ChestX-ray8 Dataset**:
  > Wang, X., Y. Zhang, H. S. S. L. et al. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2097â€“2106, 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
