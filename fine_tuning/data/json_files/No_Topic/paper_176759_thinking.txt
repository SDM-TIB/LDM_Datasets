To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Batch Renormalization: Towards Reducing Minibatch Dependence in Batch-Normalized Models" by Sergey Ioffe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and its limitations with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of Batch Normalization without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **results section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training and evaluation of their models. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision, and it is crucial to document it properly.

In section 4.1 (Baseline), the authors state that they trained their baseline model on the **ImageNet training set** and evaluated it on the **ImageNet validation data**. This confirms the use of the ImageNet dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

I will create an entry for the ImageNet dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is essential for proper documentation. After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
