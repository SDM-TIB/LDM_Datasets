To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Task-aware Command Recommendation and Proactive Help for Analysts" by Aadhavan M. Nambhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions analyzing usage logs from a web-based analytics system, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset and Pre-processing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they analyzed a proprietary dataset obtained from the usage logs of an interactive analysis and visualization section of the software. This section provides crucial information about the dataset, including the number of command sequences and unique commands.

The authors state that they extracted around **350,000 command sequences** from the usage logs, which were collected over a month. They also mention that there were around **300 unique commands** after filtering out non-executed commands. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and characteristics.

Since the dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, I will note that in the dataset description. However, I will still provide a citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset information.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper as the dataset reference:

- **Dataset Name**: Proprietary Usage Logs from Web-based Analytics Software
- **Description**: A dataset containing approximately 350,000 command sequences extracted from the usage logs of an interactive analysis and visualization software, with around 300 unique commands.
- **Citation**:

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and clearly presented.
