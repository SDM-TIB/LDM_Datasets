To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RE-centric Recommendations for the Development of Trustworthy(er) Autonomous Systems" by Krishna Ronanki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on ethical AI guidelines and frameworks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. This section discusses the need for trustworthy AI and the role of requirements engineering but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology**, I will look for any datasets used in the literature review or meta-analysis. The methodology describes a systematic literature review process but does not mention specific datasets.

In the **results and analysis section**, the authors present findings from their comparative analysis of ethical AI guidelines and frameworks. However, this section primarily focuses on principles and limitations rather than datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets used in the studies reviewed. The references include various ethical AI guidelines and frameworks but do not explicitly mention datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is primarily on ethical guidelines and frameworks rather than empirical datasets.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. However, I will document this finding clearly, noting that the paper does not include datasets relevant to the research conducted.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings and prepare to communicate that no datasets were extracted from this particular research paper.
