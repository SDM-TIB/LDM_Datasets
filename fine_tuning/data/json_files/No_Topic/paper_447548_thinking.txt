To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BUSClean: Open-source software for breast ultrasound image pre-processing and knowledge extraction for medical AI" by Arianna Bunnell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on an internal testing dataset of 430 clinical BUS images and a case study on an external public dataset of BUS scans. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors describe the internal dataset used for developing BUSClean, which consists of 2,000 BUS scans from the Hawaiʻi and Pacific Islands Mammography Registry (HIPIMR). They also mention the characteristics of the internal test dataset of 430 BUS images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a summary of the internal test dataset and the external dataset used for the case study, which is the BUSI dataset. The BUSI dataset is described as containing 780 BUS images collected from Baheya Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, and is publicly available. This confirms the presence of two distinct datasets.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **internal dataset** (HIPIMR), while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is important to note that it is derived from a registry and may not have a formal publication. However, I will mention it as:
   > Hawaiʻi and Pacific Islands Mammography Registry (HIPIMR; WCG IRB Study Number 1264170).

2. For the **BUSI dataset**, the citation is:
   > W. Al-Dhabyani, M. Gomaa, H. Khaled, and A. Fahmy. "Dataset of breast ultrasound images," *Data in brief*, vol. 28, p. 104863, 2020.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

- **Internal Testing Dataset**: 430 clinical BUS images from the HIPIMR.
- **BUSI Dataset**: 780 BUS images collected from Baheya Hospital for Early Detection and Treatment of Women’s Cancer, Cairo, Egypt.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
