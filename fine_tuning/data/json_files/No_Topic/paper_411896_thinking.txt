To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MKA: A Scalable Medical Knowledge Assisted Mechanism for Generative Models on Medical Conversation Tasks" by Ke Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors state that their evaluation is carried out on the **MedDialog** and **MedDG** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They mention that the **MedDialog dataset** is a large-scale medical dialogue dataset, and the **MedDG dataset** is a large-scale medical consultation dataset. This gives me a better understanding of the nature of these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MedDialog**, the citation is:
  > Chen, S., Ju, Z., Dong, X., Fang, H., Wang, S., Yang, Y., Zeng, J., Zhang, R., Zhang, R., Zhou, M., Zhu, P., Xie, P. (2020). MedDialog: A Large-scale Medical Dialogue Dataset. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). Online: pp: 9241-9250.

- For **MedDG**, the citation is:
  > Guangtao Zeng, Wenmian Yang, Zeqian Ju, Yue Yang, Sicheng Wang, Ruisi Zhang, Meng Zhou, Jiaqi Zeng, Xiangyu Dong, Ruoyu Zhang, Hongchao Fang, Penghui Zhu, Shu Chen, and Pengtao Xie (2020). MedDG: A Large-scale Medical Consultation Dataset for Building Medical Dialogue System. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Online. pp: 9241-9250.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **MedDialog**: A large-scale medical dialogue dataset used for training and evaluating medical chatbots.
   - Citation: Chen, S., Ju, Z., Dong, X., Fang, H., Wang, S., Yang, Y., Zeng, J., Zhang, R., Zhang, R., Zhou, M., Zhu, P., Xie, P. (2020). MedDialog: A Large-scale Medical Dialogue Dataset. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). Online: pp: 9241-9250.

2. **MedDG**: A large-scale medical consultation dataset designed for building medical dialogue systems.
   - Citation: Guangtao Zeng, Wenmian Yang, Zeqian Ju, Yue Yang, Sicheng Wang, Ruisi Zhang, Meng Zhou, Jiaqi Zeng, Xiangyu Dong, Ruoyu Zhang, Hongchao Fang, Penghui Zhu, Shu Chen, and Pengtao Xie (2020). MedDG: A Large-scale Medical Consultation Dataset for Building Medical Dialogue System. In: Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Online. pp: 9241-9250.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
