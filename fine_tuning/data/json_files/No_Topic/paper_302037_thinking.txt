To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TempoRL: Learning When to Act" by AndrÃ© Biedenkapp et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various environments, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their evaluations. In this section, they mention using specific environments for testing their method. I will look for any named datasets or environments that could be considered datasets.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, the authors describe their experiments on **grid-world environments** such as the **Cliff**, **Bridge**, and **ZigZag** environments. These are not traditional datasets but rather simulation environments used for reinforcement learning experiments. However, they provide valuable data for evaluating the proposed method.

In section 4.2, the authors mention using **OpenAI Gym environments** like **Pendulum-v0**, **MountainCar-v0**, and **LunarLander-v2**. These environments are also not datasets in the conventional sense but are widely recognized benchmarks in reinforcement learning research.

I will now check the **References section** to find any formal citations related to these environments. However, since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym library, they may not have individual citations. Instead, I will cite the OpenAI Gym paper:

- For OpenAI Gym, the citation is:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., and Zaremba, W. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv:1606.01540 [cs.LG], 2016.

Next, I will summarize the identified environments as datasets:

1. **Cliff Environment**: A grid-world environment where agents must navigate to reach a goal while avoiding falling off a cliff.
2. **Bridge Environment**: Similar to the Cliff environment but with a smaller cliff area.
3. **ZigZag Environment**: A more complex grid-world requiring multiple direction changes to reach the goal.
4. **Pendulum-v0**: An OpenAI Gym environment where the agent must balance a pendulum.
5. **MountainCar-v0**: An OpenAI Gym environment where the agent must build momentum to reach the top of a hill.
6. **LunarLander-v2**: An OpenAI Gym environment where the agent must land a spacecraft on the lunar surface.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
