To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChemGymRL: An Interactive Framework for Reinforcement Learning for Digital Chemistry" by Chris Beeler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the ChemGymRL framework, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the context of the experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the different benches (Extraction, Reaction, and Distillation) and their functionalities. I will check if any specific datasets are associated with these benches or if they reference any existing datasets used for training the RL agents.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ChemGymRL environments," I will look for the original source or documentation that describes this dataset in detail. If the dataset is based on existing chemical datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to cite those original sources as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
