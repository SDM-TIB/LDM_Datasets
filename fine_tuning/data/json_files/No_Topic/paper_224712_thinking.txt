To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Objective Automatic Machine Learning with AutoxgboostMC" by Florian PÔ¨Åsterer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the context in which they are used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors discuss the use of a multi-criteria AutoML system, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the methodology or application sections. Therefore, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. 

If I find any datasets mentioned in the references, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to datasets used in previous studies, I will look up those studies to obtain the correct citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
