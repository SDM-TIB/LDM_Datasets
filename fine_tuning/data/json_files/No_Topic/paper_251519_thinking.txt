To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Embedded Multi-View Clustering with Collaborative Training" by Jie Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on several popular multi-view datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the study.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the following datasets:

1. **NosiyMnist-RotatingMnist (Noisy-Rotating)**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 samples of handwritten digits. The authors explain how they constructed the RotatingMnist by rotating images and NosiyMnist by adding noise to the images.

2. **Mnist-USPS**: This dataset consists of samples from the MNIST and USPS datasets, where each view contains 5000 digits, with each class providing 500 samples.

3. **Fashion-10K**: This dataset includes 10,000 gray images from the Fashion dataset, categorized into 10 different types of clothing.

4. **Mnist-10K**: Similar to Fashion-10K, this dataset uses the test set of the MNIST dataset, with additional views constructed in the same manner as Fashion-10K.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **USPS dataset**:
  > The USPS dataset is commonly referenced in literature but may not have a single authoritative citation. It is often cited as:
  > "USPS handwritten digit dataset".

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
