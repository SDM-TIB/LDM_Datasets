To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks in Video Human Action Recognition: A Review" by Zihan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets overview sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus, while the introduction may highlight specific datasets used in the context of video human action recognition.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Datasets Overview)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors list several datasets, including:

1. **Violent Flows - crowd violence**: This dataset contains 246 videos of real crowd violence, with an average duration of 3.6 seconds.
2. **UCF50**: A dataset with 150 videos categorized into 50 action classes, sourced from YouTube.
3. **UCF101**: An extension of UCF50, containing 13,320 videos across 101 action classes.
4. **NTU-RGB+D 60**: A dataset with 60 action types and 56,880 samples, utilizing RGB, depth, and skeleton data.
5. **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale dataset with at least 400 video clips per action category, totaling 400 action classes.
6. **Moments in Time**: A dataset with over 1 million videos for event understanding, containing 339 labels.
7. **Home Action Genome (HOMAGE)**: A dataset with 5,700 videos across 75 activities and 453 atomic actions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is accurately cited with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper and their respective sources.
