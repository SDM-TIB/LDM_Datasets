To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Small-world networks for summarization of biomedical articles" by Milad Moradi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the development of a graph-based method for summarizing biomedical articles, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of summarizing biomedical texts but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will look into the **experimental results section** (Section 4) where the author discusses the evaluation of their summarization method. Here, the author mentions using a **development corpus of 100 articles** and a **random selection of 300 biomedical articles from the BioMed Centralâ€™s corpus** for text mining research. This indicates that these articles are used as datasets for the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. The references provide a source for the BioMed Central corpus, which is crucial for proper citation.

1. For the **BioMed Central corpus**, the citation is:
   > BioMed Central. "Full-text corpus access for text mining research." Available at: http://old.biomedcentral.com/about/datamining

2. The **development corpus** is mentioned but does not have a specific citation provided in the references. Since it is a custom dataset created for the study, I will note it as such without a formal citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will summarize the findings:

- The **BioMed Central corpus** is a dataset used for evaluating the summarization method, consisting of 300 biomedical articles.
- The **development corpus** is a custom dataset of 100 biomedical articles used to determine the optimal value for the meaningfulness parameter.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited where applicable. This will facilitate any downstream tasks that require dataset information from this research paper.
