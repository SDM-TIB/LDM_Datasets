To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SC-Ques: A Sentence Completion Question Dataset for English as a Second Language Learners" by Qiongqiong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced. The abstract mentions the **SC-Ques dataset**, which consists of 289,148 ESL sentence completion questions. This indicates that the dataset is significant and likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for additional context about the dataset. Here, the authors discuss the limitations of existing SC datasets and emphasize the need for a larger dataset like SC-Ques. This reinforces the importance of the SC-Ques dataset but does not introduce any new datasets.

I will then look at **section 2 (The SC-Ques Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They explain the data collection process, the categorization of questions, and the statistics of the dataset. This section confirms that SC-Ques is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

In the **data collection subsection**, the authors describe how the SC-Ques dataset was created from real English assignment questions used for K-12 students, developed by teaching professionals. This provides context for the dataset's origin and its intended use.

I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections to see if any other datasets are mentioned or if SC-Ques is used in comparison with other datasets. However, the focus remains on SC-Ques, and no additional datasets are introduced.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the SC-Ques dataset. Since the dataset is created by the authors themselves, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset:

- For **SC-Ques**, the citation is:
  > Qiongqiong Liu, Yaying Huang, Zitao Liu, Shuyan Huang, Jiahao Chen, Xiangyu Zhao, Guimin Lin, Yuyu Zhou, Weiqi Luo. *SC-Ques: A Sentence Completion Question Dataset for English as a Second Language Learners*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the information about the SC-Ques dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will prepare me to present the dataset in the specified format for further processing or review.
