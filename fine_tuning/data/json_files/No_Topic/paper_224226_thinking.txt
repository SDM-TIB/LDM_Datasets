To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing for Differential Abundance in Compositional Counts Data, with Application to Microbiome Studies" by Barak Brill et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method on three different datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section** where the authors describe their approach and the datasets used for validation. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Crohn’s Disease Study**: This dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying differential abundance in microbiome data related to Crohn's disease.

2. **Human Microbiome Project**: This dataset is referenced as a source of microbiome data for testing the method, showcasing its applicability to a well-known microbiome dataset.

3. **Spiked-in Bacteria Experiment**: This dataset involves an experimental setup where specific bacteria are spiked into samples to assess the method's performance in detecting differential abundance.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Crohn’s Disease Study**, I will look for the original publication that describes the dataset, which is likely to be cited in the references.

- For the **Human Microbiome Project**, I will find the relevant citation that details the dataset and its characteristics.

- For the **Spiked-in Bacteria Experiment**, I will also search for the original study that describes this experimental design and its dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset documentation in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
