To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Communications for Speech Signals" by Zhenzi Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments and the datasets used for training and testing their proposed model. Specifically, I will focus on any sections that detail the datasets, such as the number of samples, types of files, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they adopted a speech dataset from **Edinburgh DataShare**, which comprises more than 10,000 .wav files for the training set and 800 .wav files for the test set. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Edinburgh DataShare dataset. If the dataset is not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that it is a publicly available dataset and provide the necessary details to locate it.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Edinburgh DataShare. *Speech Dataset*. Available at: https://data.ed.ac.uk/dataset/speech-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
