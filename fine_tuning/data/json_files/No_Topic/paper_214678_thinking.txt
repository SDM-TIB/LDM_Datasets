To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Application-Specific VLIW Processor with Vector Instruction Set for CNN Acceleration" by Andreas Bytyn, Rainer Leupers, and Gerd Ascheid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the ConvAix processor on well-known CNNs, specifically **AlexNet** and **VGG-16**, which suggests that these models may be associated with specific datasets.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference CNNs and their applications in object classification and detection, but I need to find specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors mention benchmarking ConvAix using **AlexNet** and **VGG-16**. I will check if there are any references to the datasets used for these models. Typically, AlexNet is evaluated on the **ImageNet** dataset, and VGG-16 is also trained on the same dataset. 

Now, I will confirm the dataset names and details in the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The relevant citations for the datasets are:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton. “ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.” *Advances In Neural Information Processing Systems*, pp. 1–9, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets beyond these well-known models, I will compile the dataset information.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and accurate representation of the datasets referenced in the paper.
