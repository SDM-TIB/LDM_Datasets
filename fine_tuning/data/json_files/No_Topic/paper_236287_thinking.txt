To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Error-bounded Lossy Compression (EBLC) to Reduce the Bandwidth Requirement for Real-time Vision-based Pedestrian Safety Applications" by Mizanur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a dynamic EBLC strategy for pedestrian detection, which suggests that there may be datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsections that describe data generation and model calibration. In the paper, the authors mention collecting field data from the Perimeter Road and Avenue of Champions intersection at Clemson, South Carolina. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from real-world video footage.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors describe the pedestrian detection accuracy across various environmental conditions, which may imply the use of different datasets for training and testing under those conditions.

In the **data generation and description subsection**, the authors state that they collected a total of 427 images of pedestrians moving in different directions. They also mention performing data augmentation to create images for various environmental conditions, resulting in a total of 14,945 images. This indicates that the dataset is not only the original 427 images but also includes augmented data.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Field Data from Clemson, South Carolina**: This dataset contains 427 images of pedestrians collected from a specific intersection. The authors note that this dataset is publicly available at a provided link.

2. **Augmented Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14,945 images generated through data augmentation techniques to simulate various environmental conditions.

Next, I will ensure to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for referencing the datasets:

- Mizanur Rahman, Mhafuzul Islam, Jon C. Calhoun, and Mashrur Chowdhury. *Dynamic Error-bounded Lossy Compression (EBLC) to Reduce the Bandwidth Requirement for Real-time Vision-based Pedestrian Safety Applications*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for proper attribution.
