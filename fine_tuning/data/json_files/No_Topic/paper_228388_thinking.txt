To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Matters: Recovering Human Semantic Structure from Machine Learning Analysis of Large-Scale Text Corpora" by Marius Cătălin Iordan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets, such as **Methods** or **Experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology for generating word embedding spaces and the datasets used for training these models. I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Data Collection" or "Training Corpora."

In the **Methods section**, the authors mention the construction of two primary types of datasets: **contextually-constrained models** for "nature" and "transportation." They specify the number of words in each dataset, which is crucial for understanding the scale of the data used.

1. **Nature Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from English language Wikipedia articles related to the "animal" category, resulting in approximately 70 million words.
2. **Transportation Dataset**: This dataset is created from articles related to "transport" and "travel," yielding around 50 million words.

Next, I will check the **Results section** to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide further details about the datasets used in their experiments. They may also discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, which can provide insights into their significance.

After gathering the necessary information about the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors reference specific datasets or prior works that describe these datasets, I will ensure to include those citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly attributed.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the importance of full citations for each dataset.
