To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Image Segmentation From A Feedback Control Perspective" by Liangjia Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction may discuss the context of the research and reference existing datasets used in related work.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using two types of images for their experiments: general images and medical images. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in the experimental results section. To ensure I capture all relevant datasets, I will also check the **literature review and references sections** for any datasets that might have been cited or used in previous works referenced by the authors.

In the references, I find that the authors cite a database of human segmented natural images, which is relevant to their work. The citation for this dataset is:
> Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., & Malik, J. (2001). A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), volume 2, pages 416â€“423.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using CT images for medical segmentation tasks, but they do not specify a particular dataset. Since they refer to common practices in the field, I will not assign a citation for this as it is more of a general reference to the type of data used.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
