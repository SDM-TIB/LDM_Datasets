To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuperNCN: Neighbourhood consensus network for robust outdoor scenes matching" by Grzegorz Kurzejamski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the framework has been tested on the **RobotCar Seasons dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Database)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **RobotCar Seasons dataset**. They explain that it is a subset of the **Oxford Robotcar Dataset** and contains sequences of images captured during various traversals under different weather and seasonal conditions. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citation for the **Oxford Robotcar Dataset** since the RobotCar Seasons dataset is derived from it. The citation for the Oxford Robotcar Dataset is:

- **Oxford Robotcar Dataset**:
  > Maddern, W., Pascoe, G., Linegar, C., & Newman, P. (2017). *1 Year, 1000km: The Oxford RobotCar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 36(1), 3â€“15.

The authors also mention that the **RobotCar Seasons dataset** is specifically designed for evaluating their method, which confirms its significance in the context of the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **RobotCar Seasons Dataset**: This dataset includes sequences of images captured during multiple traversals through the same route in varying weather and seasonal conditions. It provides ground truth poses for each image and is essential for evaluating the proposed method.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for both datasets, as they are critical for proper attribution in any subsequent work or analysis.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
