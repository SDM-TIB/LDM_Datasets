To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers" by Francesco Paissan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data, which suggests that specific datasets are used for these evaluations. I will look for any dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the **ESC50 dataset** and the **UrbanSound8k dataset**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments subsection 3.1**, the authors state that they utilized the **ESC50 dataset**, which contains 50 environmental sound classes. They also mention that the dataset was used for both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. This confirms its significance in their experiments.

In subsection 3.2, they provide additional results on the **UrbanSound8k dataset**, which is another dataset used for evaluating their method. This dataset is known for its diverse urban sound classes, and the authors mention that they conducted experiments on it as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

- For the **ESC50 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Piczak, K. J. (2015). ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification. In Proceedings of the 23rd Annual ACM Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1015â€“1018. ACM Press. doi: 10.1145/2733373.2806390.

- For the **UrbanSound8k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Salamon, J., Jacoby, C., & Bello, J. P. (2014). A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research. In ACM International Conference on Multimedia.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
