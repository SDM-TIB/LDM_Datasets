To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualCoOp: Fast Adaptation to Multi-Label Recognition with Limited Annotations" by Ximeng Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on standard multi-label recognition benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **MS-COCO** and **VOC2007** for multi-label recognition with partial labels, and also on **MS-COCO** and **NUS-WIDE** for zero-shot multi-label recognition.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **MS-COCO**: The paper states that MS-COCO contains 80 common object categories and uses the official train2014 (82K images) and val2014 (40K images) splits for training and testing.

2. **VOC2007**: This dataset contains 20 object categories, and the authors use the official trainval (5K images) and test (5K images) splits for training and testing.

3. **NUS-WIDE**: This dataset includes 270K images, with 81 human-annotated categories as unseen classes and an additional set of 925 labels obtained from Flickr tags as seen classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

- For **PASCAL VOC 2007**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For **NUS-WIDE**, the citation is:
  > Tat-Seng Chua, Jinhui Tang, Richang Hong, Haojie Li, Zhiping Luo, and Yantao Zheng. *NUS-WIDE: A Real-World Web Image Database from National University of Singapore*. In ICIVR, 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
