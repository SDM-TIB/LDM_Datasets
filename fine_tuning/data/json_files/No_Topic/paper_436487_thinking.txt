To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moreau Envelope for Nonconvex Bi-Level Optimization: A Single-loop and Hessian-free Solution Strategy" by Risheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several applications, including **synthetic problems, hyper-parameter learning tasks, and neural architecture search**. I will check if they provide any specific datasets for these applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "FashionMNIST" or "MNIST," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for any further processing or review.
