To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constraint-Based Regularization of Neural Networks" by Benedict Leimkuhler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. Here, the authors discuss the importance of constraints in neural network training but do not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.

To confirm the datasets used, I will check the **results section** where the authors discuss the performance of their methods on these datasets. They provide comparative results for their constrained methods against standard SGD methods on both CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, confirming their use in the experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
