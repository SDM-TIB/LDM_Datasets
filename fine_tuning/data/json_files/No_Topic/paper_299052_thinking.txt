To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthesising Multi-Modal Minority Samples for Tabular Data" by Sajad Darabi and Yotam Elor, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with **27 publicly available real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors do not have a specific section titled "Datasets," but they refer to the datasets used throughout the paper. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might list these datasets.

In the **experiments** section, the authors mention evaluating their oversampling methods on **27 public datasets** included in the imbalanced-learn library. I will need to identify these datasets explicitly. The paper references the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a common source for datasets in machine learning research.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors acknowledge datasets provided in references [14], [33], [30], and [25]. I will look up these references to obtain the complete citations.

1. For the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the citation is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php

2. For the **coil challenge 2000 dataset**, the citation is:
   > van der Putten, P., & van Someren, M. (2000). Coil Challenge 2000: The Insurance Company Case.

3. For the **breast cancer dataset**, the citation is:
   > Elter, M., & Wittenberg, T. (2008). The prediction of breast cancer biopsy outcomes using two CAD approaches that both emphasize an intelligible decision process.

4. For the **credit card fraud detection dataset**, the citation is:
   > Blagus, R., & Lusa, L. (2012). Evaluation of SMOTE for high-dimensional class-imbalanced microarray data. In 2012 11th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), 89-94.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for further processing or review.
