To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sublinear Convergence Rates of Extragradient-Type Methods: A Survey on Classical and Recent Developments" by Quoc Tran-Dinh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading the entire paper, focusing on sections that typically mention datasets, such as the abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections. I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that may summarize datasets.

2. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Datasets**: As I read, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets. This includes names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.). I will also note any context in which these datasets are used, such as for training, validation, or testing of models.

3. **Check for References to Datasets**: If the paper refers to datasets that are well-known or commonly used in the field, I will ensure to note these references. I will also look for any citations that provide more detailed information about the datasets.

4. **Consult the References Section**: After identifying datasets in the main text, I will check the references section of the paper for full citations of the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for providing accurate and complete citations.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
   - **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Cross-Verify Information**: If any datasets are mentioned without citations, I will cross-reference with external sources or previous works to ensure that I have the correct and complete citation information.

7. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset entry.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their full citations, which is essential for proper academic referencing and further research.
