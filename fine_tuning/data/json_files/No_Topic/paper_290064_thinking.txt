To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedding Power Flow into Machine Learning for Parameter and State Estimation" by Laurent Pagnier and Michael Chertkov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they prepared five different datasets, each consisting of 2000 samples, sorted from case #1 to case #5 based on their perceived mapping complexities. This indicates that there are specific datasets utilized in their experiments.

I will also look for any **specific details** about these datasets, such as how they were generated or any characteristics that define them. The authors reference a prior work ([21]) for the data generation process, which suggests that I should check that reference for more information about the datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the datasets are generated based on the IEEE-118 model and the authors refer to their previous work, I will include the citation for that work as it is relevant to understanding the datasets.

The relevant citations are:

1. For the dataset generation process:
   > L. Pagnier and M. Chertkov, “Physics-informed graphical neural network for parameter & state estimations in power systems,” arXiv:2102.06349, 2021.

2. For the IEEE-118 model:
   > IEEE Power and Energy Society, “IEEE 118 Bus Test Case,” available at: https://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/pf118/pg_tca118bus.htm.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
