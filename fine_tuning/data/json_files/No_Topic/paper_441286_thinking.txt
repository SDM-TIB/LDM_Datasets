To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EAVE: Efficient Product Attribute Value Extraction via Lightweight Sparse-layer Interaction" by Li Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive evaluations on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **MAVE Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large and diverse dataset for product attribute extraction, containing 3 million attribute value annotations across 1257 fine-grained categories created from 2.2 million cleaned Amazon product profiles. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **AE-110K Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the AliExpress Sports & Entertainment category and contains over 110K data examples with more than 2.7K unique attributes and 10K unique values. The authors also provide a link to this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MAVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li Yang, Qifan Wang, Jingang Wang, Xiaojun Quan, Fuli Feng, Yu Chen, Madian Khabsa, Sinong Wang, Zenglin Xu, and Dongfang Liu. *MAVE: A product dataset for multi-source attribute value extraction*. In Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM), pages 1256–1265, 2022.

- For the **AE-110K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Huimin Xu, Wenting Wang, Xin Mao, Xinyu Jiang, and Man Lan. *Scaling up open tagging from tens to thousands: Comprehension empowered attribute value extraction from product title*. In Proceedings of the 57th Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 5214–5223, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
