To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Authorship Attribution" by David Fifield, TorbjÃ¸rn Follan, and Emil Lunde, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the authors' technique but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their method and its application but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **results section**, where they describe experiments conducted on specific texts.

In **section 5 (Results)**, the authors mention two specific texts used for their experiments:

1. **Ulysses by James Joyce**: The authors used the text from Project Gutenberg, which is a well-known public domain text. They describe the text's characteristics and the results of their authorship attribution analysis.

2. **The Homeric Hymn to Apollo**: This text is also analyzed, and the authors provide details about its structure and the results of their analysis.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these texts:

- For **Ulysses**, the citation is:
  > Joyce, James. *Ulysses*. 1922. Available at: https://archive.org/details/ulysses04300gut. Accessed August 18, 2013.

- For **The Homeric Hymn to Apollo**, the citation is:
  > Anonymous. *Hymn to Apollo*. Available at: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0137:hymn=3. Accessed November 13, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
