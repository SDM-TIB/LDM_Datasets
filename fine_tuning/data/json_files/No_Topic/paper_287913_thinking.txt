To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Significance Tests of Feature Relevance for a Black-Box Learner" by Ben Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the utility of their proposed tests on "seven simulated examples and six real datasets." This suggests that there are multiple datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. If there is no specific section, I will check the **results** or **discussion** sections for any references to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **six real datasets** in their experiments. I will note down the names of these datasets as they appear in the text. If the datasets are not explicitly named, I will look for descriptions that could help identify them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, and publication details. I will do this for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names along with their descriptions and citations into a structured format. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, complete with proper citations for each.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and concise, making it easy for others to reference the datasets used in this study.
