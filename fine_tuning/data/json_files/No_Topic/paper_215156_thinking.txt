To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Question Guided Modular Routing Networks for Visual Question Answering" by Yanze Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **CLEVR** and **CLEVR-Humans** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide more details about the datasets. In section 4.1, they describe the **CLEVR dataset** as containing 100K 3D-rendered images and about one million automatically-generated questions, specifically designed to test reasoning abilities in VQA systems. They also mention the **CLEVR-Humans dataset**, which contains human-posed questions on CLEVR images, making it more complex and realistic.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CLEVR dataset**, the citation is:
   > Johnson, J.; Hariharan, B.; van der Maaten, L.; Fei-Fei, L.; Lawrence Zitnick, C.; and Girshick, R. (2017a). *CLEVR: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2901â€“2910.

2. For the **CLEVR-Humans dataset**, the citation is:
   > Johnson, J.; Hariharan, B.; van der Maaten, L.; Hoffman, J.; Fei-Fei, L.; Lawrence Zitnick, C.; and Girshick, R. (2017b). *Inferring and executing programs for visual reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
