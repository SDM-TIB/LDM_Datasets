To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spread Control Method on Unknown Networks Based on Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" by Wenxiang Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the study. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies, which could be relevant for understanding the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their simulations or evaluations. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of the experiments. If the authors mention using synthetic networks or specific datasets for their simulations, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "the SEIR model" or "scale-free networks," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. If they reference other works that used specific datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
