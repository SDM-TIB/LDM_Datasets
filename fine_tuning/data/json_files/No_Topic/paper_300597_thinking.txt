To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A time-optimal feedback control for a particular case of the game of two cars" by Aditya Chaudhari and Debraj Chakraborty, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will check the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that define them.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather detailed information. This may include the names of the datasets, the number of samples, the types of data included, and any specific conditions or configurations under which the datasets were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For each dataset, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
