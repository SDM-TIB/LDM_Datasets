To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Functions, Axioms, and Peer Review" by Ritesh Noothigattu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation and Experimental Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention using a dataset of reviews from the **26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2017)**, which is crucial for my extraction.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset, noting that it consists of **9197 reviews** from **1725 reviewers** across **2380 papers**, with specific details about the criteria used for evaluation. This is a clear indication that I have identified a significant dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IJCAI 2017 dataset. The citation is typically formatted according to the conference proceedings, and I will ensure to include all necessary details such as the title, authors, conference name, and year.

The citation for the dataset is:
> IJCAI 2017 Review Dataset. *26th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2017)*. 

Since the dataset is derived from the conference proceedings, I will also note that the dataset was made available by the program chair, which adds credibility to the source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate easy reference and further analysis in future research or applications.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the implementation and experimental results section for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section for proper documentation.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and usability.
