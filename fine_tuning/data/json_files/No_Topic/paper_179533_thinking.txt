To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Accuracy and Runtime Tradeoff in Distributed Deep Learning: A Systematic Study" by Suyog Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their approach using commonly-used image classification benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically section IV, where the authors describe the benchmark datasets and neural network architectures used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: The authors describe it as comprising 60,000 RGB images of size 32x32 pixels, partitioned into a training set of 50,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image belongs to one of 10 classes.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset is described as a collection of natural images used in the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC 2012), containing 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images, categorized into 1,000 object categories.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 1(4):7, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 1â€“42, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their proper citations.
