To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diversity Boosted Learning for Domain Generalization with Large Number of Domains" by Xi Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on datasets such as **rotated MNIST**, **rotated Fashion MNIST**, and **iwildcam**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention the datasets in the **experiments section**. I will carefully read through this section to gather specific details about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Rotated MNIST**: This dataset is an extension of the original MNIST dataset, where images are rotated at various angles (from 15° to 75°) to create multiple domains. The paper states that they created 61 domains in total for their experiments.

2. **Rotated Fashion MNIST**: Similar to the Rotated MNIST, this dataset involves rotating images from the Fashion MNIST dataset across different angles to form multiple domains, also resulting in 61 domains.

3. **iwildcam**: This dataset is part of the WILDS benchmark and consists of photos of wild animals taken from 324 different camera traps, representing various domains.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Rotated MNIST**, the original dataset citation is:
  > LeCun, Yann, Cortes, Corinna, and Burges, Chris JC. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Rotated Fashion MNIST**, the original dataset citation is:
  > Xiao, Han, Rasul, Kamal, and Vollgraf, Roland. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **iwildcam**, the citation is:
  > Koh, Pang Wei, Sagawa, Shiori, Marklund, Henrik, Xie, Sang Michael, Zhang, Marvin, Balsubramani, Akshay, Hu, Weihua, Yasunaga, Michihiro, Phillips, Richard Lanas, Gao, Irena, et al. *WILDS: A Benchmark of In-the-Wild Distribution Shifts*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 5637–5664. PMLR, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
