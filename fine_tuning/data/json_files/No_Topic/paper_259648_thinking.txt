To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence Boundary Augmentation for Neural Machine Translation Robustness" by Daniel Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges faced by Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models with noisy inputs, which suggests that datasets related to speech translation might be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they experiment on the **IWSLT English to German (EnDe) speech translation scenario**. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (2.1) where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. They mention two main sources of training data:

1. **WMT 2018 EnDe corpus**: This dataset contains 4.6 million sentence pairs and is used for training the NMT models.
2. **IWSLT 2018 EnDe training data**: This includes both the official training set and additional TED talks, totaling 0.25 million sentence pairs. The authors note that they scraped ground truth transcripts and translations from TED.com to supplement this dataset.

In the **Evaluation Data** section, the authors specify the datasets used for evaluation:

- **IWSLT tst2014**: Used as a development set.
- **IWSLT tst2015**: Used for testing.
- **IWSLT tst2018**: Also used for testing, but only includes TED talks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WMT 2018 EnDe corpus**, the citation is:

- For the **IWSLT tst2014 dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **IWSLT tst2015 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mauro Cettolo, Jan Niehues, Sebastian Stükker, Luisa Bentivogli, Roldano Cattoni, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT), 2015.

- For the **IWSLT tst2018 dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
