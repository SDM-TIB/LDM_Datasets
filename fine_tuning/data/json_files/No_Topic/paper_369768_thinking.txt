To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Case-Base Neural Networks: survival analysis with time-varying, higher-order interactions" by Jesse Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses previous works and datasets that are relevant to the current study.

Next, I will focus on the **results and experiments sections**. In these sections, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in the **application section**:

1. **SUPPORT Dataset**: This dataset tracks the time until death for seriously ill patients at five American hospitals. It contains 9,104 samples and 14 covariates, including demographic and clinical information. The authors reference the original study by Knaus et al. (1995) for more details.

2. **METABRIC Dataset**: This dataset is a long-term study of breast cancer patients, following 2,000 individuals to discover molecular drivers of breast tumors. The authors mention that it includes 1,980 patients and 10 covariates, referencing Curtis et al. (2012) for further information.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SUPPORT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Knaus, W. A., Harrell, F. E., Lynn, J., Goldman, L., Phillips, R. S., Connors, A. F., et al. (1995). The support prognostic model: Objective estimates of survival for seriously ill hospitalized adults. *Annals of Internal Medicine*, 122(3), 191–203.

- For the **METABRIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Curtis, C., Shah, S. P., Chin, S.-F., Turashvili, G., Rueda, O. M., Dunning, M. J., et al. (2012). The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups. *Nature*, 486(7403), 346–352.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
