To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are LLM-based Evaluators Confusing NLG Quality Criteria?" by Xinyu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments to verify the performance of LLMs in NLG evaluation, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using datasets for various NLG tasks, specifically summarization, paraphrase generation, and table-to-text generation. This indicates that there are specific datasets used for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for news summarization tasks and contains articles along with human-written summaries.

2. **SAMSum Dataset**: This dataset is designed for dialogue summarization and consists of conversations along with their summaries.

3. **News Commentary Dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase generation and contains pairs of sentences that convey the same meaning.

4. **WebNLG Dataset**: This dataset is used for table-to-text generation and includes tables with structured data and corresponding natural language descriptions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hermann, K. M., Kocisky, T., Grefenstette, E., et al. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In NIPS, pages 1693–1701.

- For **SAMSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). SAMSum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pages 70–79.

- For **News Commentary Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Y., Liu, P., & Qiu, X. (2021). Are factuality checkers reliable? adversarial meta-evaluation of factuality in summarization. In EMNLP (Findings), pages 2082–2095.

- For **WebNLG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gardent, C., Shimorina, A., Narayan, S., & Perez-Beltrachini, L. (2017). Creating training corpora for NLG micro-planners. In ACL (1), pages 179–188.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations.
