To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video Summarization with Long Short-term Memory" by Ke Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **SumMe**: This dataset consists of 25 user-generated videos of various events, annotated with interval-based shots.
2. **TVSum**: This dataset contains 50 YouTube videos across 10 categories, annotated with frame-level importance scores.
3. **Open Video Project (OVP)**: This dataset includes documentary videos, used for keyframe-based summarization.
4. **YouTube**: This dataset consists of YouTube videos categorized into sports, news, etc., also used for keyframe-based summarization.

The authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the characteristics of these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SumMe**, the citation is:
  > Gygli, M., Grabner, H., Riemenschneider, H., & Van Gool, L. (2014). Creating summaries from user videos. In *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)* (pp. 1-20).

- For **TVSum**, the citation is:
  > Song, Y., Vallmitjana, J., Stent, A., & Jaimes, A. (2015). TVSum: Summarizing web videos using titles. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)* (pp. 1-20).

- For **Open Video Project (OVP)**, the citation is:
  > Open Video Project. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.open-video.org/

- For **YouTube**, the citation is:
  > de Avila, S.E.F., Lopes, A.P.B., da Luz, A., & de Albuquerque Ara√∫jo, A. (2011). Vsumm: A mechanism designed to produce static video summaries and a novel evaluation method. *Pattern Recognition Letters*, 32(1), 56-68.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
