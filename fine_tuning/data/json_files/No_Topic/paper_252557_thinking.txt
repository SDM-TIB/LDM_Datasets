To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orthologics for Cones" by Mena Leemhuis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology or experiments**. These sections typically contain references to datasets used in the research. The abstract provides a concise overview, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections usually detail the datasets used for analysis, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that may summarize dataset information.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive details. This section may provide insights into the datasets' origins, how they were collected, and their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will search for the original source of the dataset online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of each dataset in the context of the research findings.
