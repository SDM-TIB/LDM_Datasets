To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Data Augmentations for Graph Classification" by Youzhi Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method, GraphAug, and its effectiveness in graph classification, but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the challenges of data scarcity in graph classification and the need for effective augmentation methods, but again, no specific datasets are named.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly **section 4**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1**, they mention two synthetic datasets used for evaluation: **COLORS** and **TRIANGLES**. The COLORS dataset is used for classifying graphs based on the number of green nodes, while the TRIANGLES dataset is for classifying graphs based on the number of triangles (three-node cycles). This is a crucial finding as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

In **subsection 4.2**, the authors discuss their experiments on benchmark datasets, specifically mentioning six datasets from the TUDatasets benchmark: **MUTAG**, **NCI109**, **NCI1**, **PROTEINS**, **IMDB-BINARY**, and **COLLAB**. They also mention the **ogbg-molhiv** dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the synthetic datasets, since they are generated by the authors, I will cite the original paper that describes their generation:

1. **COLORS Dataset**: 
   > Knyazev, B., Taylor, G. W., & Amer, M. (2019). Understanding attention and generalization in graph neural networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

2. **TRIANGLES Dataset**: 
   > Knyazev, B., Taylor, G. W., & Amer, M. (2019). Understanding attention and generalization in graph neural networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

For the benchmark datasets, I will refer to the TUDataset paper:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference.
