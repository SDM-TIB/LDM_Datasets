To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEMEDA: Enhancing Segmentation Precision with Semantic Edge Aware Loss" by Yifu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Pascal VOC 2012** and **Cityscapes** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 20 foreground object classes and one background class, with a total of 10,582 training images and 1,449 validation images. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking semantic segmentation tasks.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset consists of 2,975 images annotated with pixel-wise annotations for 18 object classes and one background class. The authors report results on the validation set, which contains 500 images.

To confirm the details about these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The pascal visual object classes challenge: A retrospective*. International journal of computer vision, 111(1):98â€“136, 2015.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research and their corresponding references.
