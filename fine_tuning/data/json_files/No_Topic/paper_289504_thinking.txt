To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConDA: Continual Unsupervised Domain Adaptation" by Abu Md Niamul Tauﬁque, Chowdhury Sadman Jahan, and Andreas Savakis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three popular domain adaptation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Office Dataset**: This dataset consists of three domains: Amazon (A), DSLR (D), and Webcam (W), with 31 object classes of items found in an office environment.

2. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset includes four domains: Art (Ar), Clip Art (Cl), Product (Pr), and Real-World (Rw), with 65 classes of items found in everyday office and home environments.

3. **Visda-C Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with two domains: Synthetic (S) and Real (R), containing 12 classes. The synthetic samples are generated using 3D rendering, while the real samples are taken from the MS COCO dataset.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
