To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CFA: Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation for Target-Oriented Anomaly Localization" by Sungwook Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **MVTec AD benchmark**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the challenges of anomaly localization and references the MVTec AD benchmark as a popular dataset for visual inspection. This confirms its significance in the context of the research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method using the **MVTec AD dataset**, which consists of 5,354 industrial samples, including 1,725 test samples, divided into 15 subclasses. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MVTec AD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Paul Bergmann, Michael Fauser, David Sattlegger, and Carsten Steger. *MVTec AD–A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 9592–9600, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MVTec AD dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MVTec AD dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
