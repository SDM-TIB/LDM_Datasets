To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangled 3D Scene Generation with Layout Learning" by Dave Epstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to 3D scene generation or any datasets that the authors might have used to validate their method. If the authors refer to any well-known datasets, I will ensure to include those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
