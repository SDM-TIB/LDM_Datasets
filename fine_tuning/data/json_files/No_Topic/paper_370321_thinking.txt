To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensemaking About Contraceptive Methods Across Online Platforms" by LeAnn McDowall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected texts about birth control from various online platforms, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets they collected. Here, they mention three primary datasets:

1. **r/BirthControl Dataset**: This dataset consists of posts and comments from the Reddit community r/BirthControl, which is dedicated to discussions about birth control. The authors specify that they collected a total of 68,958 posts and 264,912 comments, with a year range from 2007 to 2020.

2. **WebMD Reviews Dataset**: This dataset includes user-written medication reviews from WebMD related to birth control. The authors collected 18,110 reviews, focusing on those with more than five reviews for specific medications. The year range for this dataset is from 2006 to 2020.

3. **Twitter Dataset**: This dataset comprises Twitter posts and replies discussing birth control. The authors collected 499,796 posts and 211,896 replies, with a year range from 2006 to 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any relevant studies or datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own data collection efforts rather than external datasets that require citations.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of entries and the time frame of the data collection.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
