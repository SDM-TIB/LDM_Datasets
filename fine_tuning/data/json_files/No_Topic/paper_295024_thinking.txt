To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Alignment-Agnostic Model for Chinese Text Error Correction" by Liying Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on three datasets: **CGED 2020**, **SIGHAN 2015**, and **SIGHAN-synthesize**. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as their characteristics, sizes, and any modifications made for the experiments.

1. **CGED 2020**: This dataset is described as containing writing samples from foreign Chinese learners, with a total of 2586 samples. The authors mention that they removed certain samples to focus on relevant error types, resulting in 846 training samples and 1165 testing samples.

2. **SIGHAN 2015**: This dataset is noted to contain text-aligned data, with a training set of 8738 passages and a test set of 1100 passages. The authors also mention incorporating data from SIGHAN 2013 and 2014 for training.

3. **SIGHAN-synthesize**: This dataset is synthesized from the SIGHAN 2015 dataset to create non-aligned data. The authors describe how they generated this dataset by modifying existing samples to include missing and redundant characters.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CGED 2020**, the citation is:
  > Gaoqi Rao, Erhong Yang, and Baolin Zhang. *Overview of NLPTEA-2020 shared task for Chinese grammatical error diagnosis*. In Proceedings of the 6th Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications, pages 25–35, 2020.

- For **SIGHAN 2015**, the citation is:
  > Yuen-Hsien Tseng, Lung-Hao Lee, Li-Ping Chang, and Hsin-Hsi Chen. *Introduction to SIGHAN 2015 bake-off for Chinese spelling check*. In Proceedings of the Eighth SIGHAN Workshop on Chinese Language Processing, pages 32–37, 2015.

- For **SIGHAN-synthesize**, since it is a synthesized dataset based on SIGHAN 2015, I will reference the original SIGHAN 2015 citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
