To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Efficient Continuous Manifold Learning for Time Series Modeling" by Seungwoo Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on various public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in subsections like **5.1 Datasets and Preprocessing**. Here, the authors detail the datasets used for different tasks:

1. **UCF11 Dataset**: This dataset is used for action recognition and consists of 1,600 video clips across 11 action categories. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps taken with this dataset.

2. **SleepEDF-20 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for sleep staging classification and includes polysomnography recordings from 20 subjects. The authors describe how the data was segmented and labeled.

3. **UEA Archive**: This is a collection of 30 real-world multivariate time-series datasets used for classification tasks. The authors mention the variety of applications covered by this archive.

4. **ETT Datasets**: These datasets are used for forecasting tasks and consist of electricity transformer temperature measurements.

5. **TADPOLE Database**: This dataset is used for imputation tasks related to Alzheimer's disease, containing various biomarkers from patients.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the research paper.
