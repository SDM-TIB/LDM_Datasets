To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mode Combinability: Exploring Convex Combinations of Permutation Aligned Models" by Adrián Csiszárik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **section 4 (Model combinations in the hyperrectangle)**, as this section discusses the experimental setup and is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using two different vision architectures: **ResNet-20** and **Tiny-10**, and they specify that both models were trained on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in the references of papers that utilize it.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report. University of Toronto. Toronto, Ontario.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the models in the experiments. It consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and properly formatted for reference in future work. This will allow for easy access to the dataset information for anyone reviewing the paper or conducting related research.
