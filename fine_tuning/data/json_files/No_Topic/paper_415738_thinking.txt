To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PerSHOP - A Persian dataset for shopping dialogue systems" by Keyvan Mahmoudi and Heshaam Faili, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a dataset of dialogues in the Persian language for shopping dialogue systems, which suggests that this dataset is central to the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the lack of open datasets in the Persian language for shopping dialogue systems, reinforcing the significance of the PerSHOP dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the PerSHOP dataset in detail in **section 3 (Dataset)**. Here, they provide specific statistics about the dataset, including the number of utterances, dialogues, and the method of data collection through crowd-sourcing.

The key dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **PerSHOP Dataset**: This dataset contains 21,925 utterances across 1,061 dialogues, focusing on shopping interactions in the Persian language. It is noted as the largest Persian dataset in this field and is freely available for future research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PerSHOP dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, as it is part of their own work. However, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset:

- For the **PerSHOP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Keyvan Mahmoudi and Heshaam Faili. *PerSHOP - A Persian dataset for shopping dialogue systems*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [pages], [year]. [Publisher].

Since the specific conference name, pages, and year are not provided in the text, I will note that these details need to be filled in based on the actual publication information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
