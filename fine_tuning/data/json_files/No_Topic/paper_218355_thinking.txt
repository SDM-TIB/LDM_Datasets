To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Submodular Minimization via Block-Wise Updates and Communications" by Andrea Testa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a distributed algorithm for submodular optimization and mentions an application to a distributed image segmentation problem. This suggests that there may be datasets related to image segmentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the application of their algorithm. In this section, they specifically mention using a binary image segmentation problem with 8 agents, each having access to a portion of the image. However, they do not explicitly name a dataset at this point.

I will then look for any **figures or tables** that might provide additional context or references to datasets. Figure 2 shows the communication graph and the portions of the image accessible to each agent, but it does not provide a dataset name.

Next, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in the experiments. The authors reference several works related to image segmentation and submodular functions, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite the following relevant works:

1. **Graph Cuts and Efficient N-D Image Segmentation**:
   > Y. Boykov and G. Funka-Lea, “Graph cuts and efficient n-d image segmentation,” *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 70, no. 2, pp. 109–131, 2006.

2. **Exact Maximum a Posteriori Estimation for Binary Images**:
   > D. M. Greig, B. T. Porteous, and A. H. Seheult, “Exact maximum a posteriori estimation for binary images,” *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological)*, vol. 51, no. 2, pp. 271–279, 1989.

These references suggest that the authors are likely using datasets related to image segmentation, but they do not specify a particular dataset name in the paper itself.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

- The paper discusses a **distributed image segmentation problem** but does not provide a specific dataset name.
- The references to previous works imply the use of datasets related to image segmentation, particularly those discussed in the cited papers.

Since the paper does not explicitly name a dataset, I will note that while the authors refer to established methods and techniques in image segmentation, they do not provide a unique dataset citation within the text.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings, noting the lack of explicit dataset names but referencing the relevant works that imply the datasets used in the experiments.
