To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Upper and lower memory capacity bounds of transformers for next-token prediction" by Liam Madden et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the capabilities of decoder-only transformers in next-token prediction but does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **TinyStories dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates that a specific dataset is utilized in their research.

I will then look for a detailed description of the **TinyStories dataset** within the paper. The authors provide some context about the dataset, mentioning that they take subsets of varying sizes from it for their experiments. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset within the text.

To ensure I have the correct citation, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the TinyStories dataset as follows:
- **TinyStories Dataset**: 
  > Eldan, R., & Li, Y. (2023). *Tinystories: How small can language models be and still speak coherent English?* arXiv preprint arXiv:230507759.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **TinyStories Dataset**: The dataset is used for training and evaluating the transformer models in the context of next-token prediction. The authors mention subsets of this dataset with varying sizes for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
