To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Molecular gates in mesoporous bioactive glasses for the treatment of bone tumors and infection" by Lorena Polo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets or experimental conditions.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setups, including any datasets used for testing or validation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, such as those related to drug delivery studies or biological assessments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize data collected during the experiments. This section may provide insights into the datasets used, including their characteristics and the outcomes of the experiments.

I will also examine the **discussion section** for any references to previously established datasets or comparisons made with other studies. This could help in identifying the datasets that are relevant to the research findings.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the original sources.

For example, if the paper references datasets related to the use of levofloxacin or doxorubicin in biological assays, I will look for the original studies or datasets that describe these compounds and their effects.

After compiling the necessary information, I will format the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its original source.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
