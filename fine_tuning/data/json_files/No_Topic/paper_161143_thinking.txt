To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entity-aware Image Caption Generation" by Di Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "new benchmark dataset collected from Flickr," which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. The introduction further discusses the need for informative image captions and references the use of images from Flickr, suggesting that this is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their model. Specifically, they mention collecting **43,586 image-caption pairs from Reuters** for training the template caption generator, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and purpose.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets mentioned. The authors describe using images from **Flickr** for testing their model, which is a key dataset for evaluating their approach. They specify that they collected **2,594 images** from Flickr for evaluation, which is important to note.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **References section**. 

1. For the **Reuters dataset**, the citation is:
   > Reuters. *Reuters News Images*. Available at: https://www.reuters.com/

2. For the **Flickr dataset**, the citation is:
   > Flickr. *Flickr Creative Commons Images*. Available at: https://www.flickr.com/

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are critical for proper attribution and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for downstream processing or review.
