To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Multi-modal Recommender Systems by Denoising and Aligning Multi-modal Content and User Feedback" by Guipeng Xv et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves significant improvements across various datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** that summarizes the statistics of the datasets used, which includes the names of the datasets and their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Baby Dataset**: Contains 160,792 observations, 19,445 users, and 7,050 items. The average visual similarity is 0.2240, and the average textual similarity is 0.2627.

2. **Sports Dataset**: Contains 296,337 observations, 35,598 users, and 18,357 items. The average visual similarity is 0.2085, and the average textual similarity is 0.2184.

3. **Clothing Dataset**: Contains 278,677 observations, 39,387 users, and 23,033 items. The average visual similarity is 0.2239, and the average textual similarity is 0.3880.

4. **TikTok Dataset**: Contains 68,722 observations, 9,308 users, and 6,710 items. The average visual similarity is 0.8556, and the average textual similarity is 0.7113, with an acoustic similarity of 0.1245.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in research and may not have specific papers associated with them, I will note that the Baby, Sports, and Clothing datasets are derived from the Amazon review dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the recommendation system community.

The citation for the Amazon review dataset is:
> J. McAuley and J. Leskovec. *From Amateurs to Connoisseurs: Modeling the Evolution of User Expertise through Online Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), pages 897â€“908, 2013. 

For the TikTok dataset, if it is not explicitly cited in the references, I will note that it is collected from the TikTok platform, and I will mention that it may not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
