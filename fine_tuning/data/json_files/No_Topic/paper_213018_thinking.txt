To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational Astrocytence: Astrocytes encode inhibitory activity into the frequency and spatial extent of their calcium elevations" by Ioannis E. Polykretis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or prior studies that utilized datasets relevant to their research. This section often provides context and may reference foundational datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mention of datasets used for simulations or experiments. The authors may describe the parameters or data sources they utilized in their computational model, which could include specific datasets.

The **results section** might also contain references to datasets, especially if the authors present data derived from their simulations or experiments. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might indicate the datasets used.

Finally, I will check the **discussion section** for any reflections on the datasets and their implications for the study's findings. The authors might discuss the relevance of the datasets in relation to their results.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any references to prior works that may have utilized datasets relevant to the study. In such cases, I will ensure to cite the original sources of those datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for the dataset as per the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with proper attribution.
