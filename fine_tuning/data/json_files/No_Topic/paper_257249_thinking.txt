To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing biological network motif significance with exponential random graph models" by Alex Stivala and Alessandro Lomi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for analysis. 

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their analyses. In this paper, the authors mention using a **yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) network** and a **human PPI network**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may provide additional context or findings related to the datasets, which can help confirm their significance and usage in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets identified:

1. **Yeast Protein-Protein Interaction Network**: The authors mention obtaining this dataset from the igraph Nexus network repository. I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset to provide a complete citation.

2. **Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network (HIPPIE)**: The authors state that they used version 2.2 of the HIPPIE database. I will find the original paper or database documentation that describes this dataset for proper citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
