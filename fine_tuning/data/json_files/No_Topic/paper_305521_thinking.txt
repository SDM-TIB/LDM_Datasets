To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Decision Rules for Binary Classification" by Oktay Günlük and Connor Lawless, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "three common fair machine learning datasets: adult, compas, and default," which indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **section A (Datasets and data processing)**. Here, they specify the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset contains 32,561 examples and 14 features, with gender as a sensitive variable. The dataset is sourced from the UCI machine learning repository.

2. **Compas Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,278 examples and 7 features, with race as a sensitive variable. The dataset is derived from ProPublica's fair machine learning cleaned dataset.

3. **Default Dataset**: This dataset includes 30,000 examples and 23 features, with gender as a sensitive variable. Like the Adult dataset, it is also sourced from the UCI machine learning repository.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2017. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- For the **Compas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, and Laura Kirchner. *Machine bias: There’s software used across the country to predict future criminals. and it’s biased against blacks*. Available at: https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing, 2016.

- For the **Default Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2017. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
