To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Operator Learning Without the Adjoint" by Nicolas Boull√© et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).

In this paper, the authors discuss the application of their methods to various problems, including the recovery of solution operators for partial differential equations. They may reference datasets related to these problems, such as benchmark datasets or synthetic datasets generated for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset" or "JHMDB Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citations in the references. If the datasets are original or generated by the authors, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
