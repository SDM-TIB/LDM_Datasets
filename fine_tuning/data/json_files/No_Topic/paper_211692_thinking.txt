To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resource-constrained multi-project scheduling with activity and time flexibility" by Viktoria A. Hauder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the development of new models and benchmarks, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed models. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset characteristics.

In the **experiments** section, I will look for any explicit references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors mention benchmark instances or datasets used for validation, I will note these down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will find its citation, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have the correct citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the information is organized and accessible for future use or analysis.
