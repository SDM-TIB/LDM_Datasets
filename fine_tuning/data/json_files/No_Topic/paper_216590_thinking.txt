To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classificação de espécies de peixe utilizando redes neurais convolucional" by André G. C. Pacheco, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifying fish species, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Classificação de peixes utilizando CNN)**, where the author explicitly mentions the dataset used for the classification task. The paper states that the dataset was collected from the **The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring challenge on Kaggle**. This indicates that the dataset is publicly available and associated with a specific challenge.

In this section, the author describes the dataset in detail, including the number of images, the resolution of the images (1280 × 974 pixels), and the classification task involving eight categories of fish species. This information is crucial for accurately documenting the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper references the Kaggle challenge, which provides a link to the dataset. The citation for the dataset will be formatted as follows:

- **The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monitoring*. Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring, accessed on December 8, 2016.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear documentation and easy reference for future use.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
