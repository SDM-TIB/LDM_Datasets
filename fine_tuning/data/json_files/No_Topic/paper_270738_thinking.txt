To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Maximum entropy and population heterogeneity in continuous cell cultures" by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz and Roberto Mulet, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets that are foundational to their research. This section often provides context and may reference prior work that includes datasets.

In the **materials and methods section**, I will pay close attention to any descriptions of experiments or simulations that involve specific datasets. The authors may describe the datasets used for modeling or analysis, including any parameters or characteristics that define them.

I will also examine the **results section** for any figures or tables that may summarize data derived from specific datasets. If the authors present results based on particular datasets, they may provide additional context or references.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or verified by others.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific metabolic network model or dataset, I will look for the original publication or source that describes that dataset in detail. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted datasets and their citations in a clear format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is properly attributed to its original source.
