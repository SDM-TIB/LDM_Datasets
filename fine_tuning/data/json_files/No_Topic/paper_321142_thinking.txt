To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRIG: Transformer-Based Text Recognizer with Initial Embedding Guidance" by Yue Tao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may hint at the datasets used. In this case, it mentions "extensive experiments on several public scene text benchmarks," indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention two synthetic datasets:

1. **MJSynth (MJ)**: This dataset contains 9 million word box images generated from a lexicon of 90K English words.
2. **SynText (ST)**: This dataset is generated by an engine and contains 7 million text lines for training.

Additionally, the authors reference several public benchmarks for evaluation, which include:

- **IIIT5K (IIIT)**: Contains 3000 images for evaluation.
- **Street View Text (SVT)**: Contains 647 images for evaluation.
- **ICDAR 2003 (IC03)**: Contains 867 images for evaluation.
- **ICDAR 2013 (IC13)**: Contains 1015 images for evaluation.
- **ICDAR 2015 (IC15)**: Contains 2077 images for evaluation.
- **SVT-Perspective (SVTP)**: Contains 645 cropped images for evaluation.
- **CUTE80 (CUTE)**: Contains 288 cropped images for evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
