To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual Extrapolation for Sparse Generalized Linear Models" by Mathurin Massias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection." In this paper, the authors discuss various datasets used for their experiments, which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **experiments section**, I will note down the datasets mentioned. For example, the authors might refer to datasets like "leukemia," "news20," "rcv1 train," "finance (log1p)," and "Magnetoencephalography (MEG)." I will ensure to capture any relevant details about each dataset, such as the number of samples (n), features (p), and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary context and credit for the datasets used in the research. I will look for citations that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the experiments section.

For example, if the paper cites the "leukemia" dataset, I will find the original source or publication that describes this dataset and note it down. This process will be repeated for each dataset identified.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further studies or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the paper "Dual Extrapolation for Sparse Generalized Linear Models."
