To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General Framework for Portfolio Construction Based on Generative Models of Asset Returns" by Tuoyuan Cheng and Kan Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of extensive simulations of cryptocurrency portfolios, which suggests that there may be datasets related to cryptocurrency prices or returns.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss various portfolio theories and methodologies, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly where they describe the backtesting process, the authors state that they retrieved price time series from Binance, covering 12 cryptocurrencies priced in USDT from June 10, 2018, to June 4, 2023. This indicates that there is a dataset related to cryptocurrency prices.

Additionally, they mention another backtest using price time series from Coinbase, covering 10 currencies priced in USD from August 8, 2019, to August 17, 2023. This provides another dataset related to cryptocurrency prices.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **Binance Cryptocurrency Dataset**: 
   - The dataset includes price time series for 12 cryptocurrencies (ADA, BNB, BTC, EOS, ETH, IOTA, LTC, NEO, ONT, QTUM, XLM, and XRP) from June 10, 2018, to June 4, 2023.

2. **Coinbase Cryptocurrency Dataset**: 
   - The dataset includes price time series for 10 cryptocurrencies (BCH, BTC, EOS, ETC, ETH, LINK, LTC, XLM, XTZ, and ZRX) from August 8, 2019, to August 17, 2023.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for these datasets. Since they are derived from the authors' own data collection from exchanges, I will note that the datasets do not have formal citations like traditional datasets but can be referenced as follows:

- For the **Binance dataset**:
  > Binance. *Cryptocurrency price data for 12 cryptocurrencies (ADA, BNB, BTC, EOS, ETH, IOTA, LTC, NEO, ONT, QTUM, XLM, XRP) from June 10, 2018, to June 4, 2023*. Retrieved from Binance exchange.

- For the **Coinbase dataset**:
  > Coinbase. *Cryptocurrency price data for 10 cryptocurrencies (BCH, BTC, EOS, ETC, ETH, LINK, LTC, XLM, XTZ, ZRX) from August 8, 2019, to August 17, 2023*. Retrieved from Coinbase exchange.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as specified. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
