To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A batching and scheduling optimisation for a cutting work-center: Acta-Mobilier case study" by Emmanuel Zimmermann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the optimization of production costs and scheduling at Acta-Mobilier, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **industrial context** and **problem statement** sections to see if any specific datasets are referenced. The paper focuses on the manufacturing processes and challenges faced by Acta-Mobilier, but it does not provide details about any datasets used for analysis or experimentation.

I will then look into the **results section** to check if any data or metrics are presented that could be considered a dataset. The results include comparisons of production times and quantities before and after optimization, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of academic papers related to scheduling and batching problems, but they do not indicate any datasets that were used in this study.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in this research paper, and thus, no citations can be provided.
