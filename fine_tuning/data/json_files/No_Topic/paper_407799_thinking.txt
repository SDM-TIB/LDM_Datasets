To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixTEA: Semi-supervised Entity Alignment with Mixture Teaching" by Feng Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "benchmark datasets" and specifically names **OpenEA**, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using the **15K benchmark dataset (V1) in OpenEA** for their experiments. This is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

In the **dataset statistics table (Table 3)**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used, including:

1. **EN-FR-15K**: This dataset consists of English and French entities, with 15,000 entities, 267 relations, and 47,334 triples.
2. **EN-DE-15K**: This dataset consists of English and German entities, with similar statistics: 15,000 entities, 210 relations, and 40,864 triples.
3. **D-W-15K**: This dataset consists of DBPedia and Wikidata entities, also with 15,000 entities, 248 relations, and 38,265 triples.
4. **D-Y-15K**: This dataset consists of DBPedia and YAGO entities, with 15,000 entities, 165 relations, and 30,292 triples.

Now, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section**. The authors reference the OpenEA dataset in the context of their experiments, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The citation for the OpenEA dataset is:
> Sun, Z., Hu, W., Wang, C., Wang, Y., & Qu, Y. (2020). A benchmarking study of embedding-based entity alignment for knowledge graphs. In Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
