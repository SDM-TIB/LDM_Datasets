To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correcting sampling biases via importance reweighting for spatial modeling" by Prokhorov Boris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on distribution bias in spatial data, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of distribution bias in spatial data but does not specify any datasets used in the study.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for validation or testing. The authors describe their approach using artificial data that resembles real-world spatial datasets, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Configuration)**, the authors mention using a uniform distribution and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for their experiments. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or specific datasets that were used in their validation.

Since the paper primarily discusses the methodology and validation using artificial data rather than established datasets, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references mainly consist of studies related to spatial modeling and error estimation, without specific datasets being highlighted.

In summary, this paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction, as it focuses on a methodological approach validated through artificial data rather than established datasets. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the text.
