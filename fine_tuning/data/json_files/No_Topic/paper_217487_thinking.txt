To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Value Functions" by Pierre Thodoroff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the specific datasets employed in the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to validate the proposed methods. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will carefully extract this information, ensuring I capture the context in which each dataset is used, such as the specific experiments or evaluations conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Mujoco suite** for experiments, I will find the appropriate citation for it. The citation for Mujoco is:
> Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). Mujoco: A physics engine for model-based control. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on (pp. 5026-5033). IEEE.

If the paper refers to any other datasets, such as benchmark datasets for reinforcement learning, I will follow the same process to find their citations.

Once I have gathered all the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their authoritative citations.
