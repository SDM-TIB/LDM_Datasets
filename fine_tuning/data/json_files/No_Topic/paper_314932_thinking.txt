To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Diffeomorphic Surface Registration and Non-Linear Modelling" by Balder Croquet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often contextualizes the work, potentially mentioning datasets used in prior studies or those that the authors are using.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the "3D Facial Norms" dataset in the **experiments section**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of individuals, any preprocessing steps taken, and how the dataset was split for training, validation, and testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the "3D Facial Norms" dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The reference provided in the paper is:

> Weinberg, S.M., Raffensperger, Z.D., Kesterke, M.J., Heike, C.L., Cunningham, M.L., Hecht, J.T., Kau, C.H., Murray, J.C., Wehby, G.L., Moreno, L.M., et al. (2016). The 3D facial norms database: Part 1. A web-based craniofacial anthropometric and image repository for the clinical and research community. *The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal*, 53(6), 185â€“197.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I format the information clearly and accurately.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for any further processing or review.
