To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding the class of global objective functions for dissimilarity-based hierarchical clustering" by Sebastien Roch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses hierarchical clustering and references various approaches and prior work, but there are no specific datasets mentioned here either. I will continue to the **main body of the paper**.

Next, I will look for sections that might detail experiments or applications of the proposed methods, particularly focusing on any sections that might be labeled as "Experiments," "Datasets," or similar. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that there are no explicit datasets described in the methodology or results sections. The paper primarily discusses theoretical aspects and does not provide empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since there are no datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not point to specific datasets.

Given this analysis, I conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries or citations as there are none present in the text.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper and provide a brief note on the lack of empirical data in the research.
