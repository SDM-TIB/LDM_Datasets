To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision Language Models via Self-Improvement" by Xiyao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the framework SIMA and mentions its application across various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify any dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any tables or figures that might list the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention evaluating their method on "14 hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks," which indicates that specific datasets are being utilized.

Upon further inspection of the **experiments section**, I will find that the authors refer to several benchmarks, including:

1. **COCO Dataset**: Used for evaluating object hallucination rates. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

2. **LLaVA in the Wild**: A benchmark for assessing visual reasoning models. The citation is:
   > Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Qingyang Wu, and Yong Jae Lee. *Visual instruction tuning*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 36, 2024.

3. **ScienceQA**: A multi-modal benchmark designed for evaluating multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The citation is:
   > Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tanglin Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan. *Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:2507–2521, 2022.

4. **TextVQA**: A dataset that benchmarks visual reasoning based on text in images. The citation is:
   > Amanpreet Singh, Vivek Natarajan, Meet Shah, Yu Jiang, Xinlei Chen, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, and Marcus Rohrbach. *Towards vqa models that can read*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8317–8326, 2019.

5. **MME**: A comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LVLMs. The citation is:
   > Chaoyou Fu, Peixian Chen, Yunhang Shen, Yulei Qin, Mengdan Zhang, Xu Lin, Jinrui Yang, Xiawu Zheng, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Yunsheng Wu, and Rongrong Ji. *Mme: A comprehensive evaluation benchmark for multimodal large language models, 2024*.

6. **MMBench**: A benchmark that expands the scope of evaluation questions. The citation is:
   > Yuan Liu, Haodong Duan, Yuanhan Zhang, Bo Li, Songyang Zhang, Wangbo Zhao, Yike Yuan, Jiaqi Wang, Conghui He, Ziwei Liu, et al. *Mmbench: Is your multi-modal model an all-around player? arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.06281, 2023*.

7. **MM-Vet**: An evaluation benchmark for multi-faceted capabilities of LVLMs. The citation is:

8. **SEEDBench**: A dataset for assessing generative comprehension capabilities. The citation is:
   > Bohao Li, Rui Wang, Guangzhi Wang, Yuying Ge, Yixiao Ge, and Ying Shan. *Seed-bench: Benchmarking multimodal llms with generative comprehension. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.16125, 2023*.

9. **VizWiz**: A dataset derived from a naturalistic setting for visual question answering. The citation is:
   > Danna Gurari, Qing Li, Abigale J Stangl, Anhong Guo, Chi Lin, Kristen Grauman, Jiebo Luo, and Jeffrey P Bigham. *Vizwiz grand challenge: Answering visual questions from blind people*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3608–3617, 2018.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
