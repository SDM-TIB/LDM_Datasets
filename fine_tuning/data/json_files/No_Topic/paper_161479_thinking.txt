To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controlling the Charging of Electric Vehicles with Neural Networks" by Martin Pilát, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it does not mention specific datasets, it indicates that the evaluation is based on realistic data from households with electric vehicles.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section III (Experiments)**, where the author discusses data preparation. Here, the author mentions two key sources of data:

1. **Pecan Street’s Dataport (PSD) database**: This database contains detailed information on the electricity consumption of several hundred households, particularly those with electric vehicles. The author specifies that the data used is from the first three months of 2015 for households in Texas that own electric vehicles.

2. **National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS)**: This survey provides information on travel patterns of US households. The author uses data from Texas from the first three months of 2009 to create realistic charging requests based on travel records.

In the **data preparation subsection**, the author describes how these datasets were combined to create realistic charging requests for the simulation. This indicates that both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Pecan Street’s Dataport (PSD) database**, the citation is:
  > Pecan Street, Inc. “Dataport.” [Online]. Available: http://dataport.cloud

- For the **National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS)**, the citation is:
  > U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, “2009 National Household Travel Survey,” 2009. [Online]. Available: http://nhts.ornl.gov

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation to ensure proper attribution and accessibility for further research.
