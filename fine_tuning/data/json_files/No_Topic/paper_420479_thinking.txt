To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MobileVLM V2: Faster and Stronger Baseline for Vision Language Model" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "rich high-quality dataset curation," which suggests that datasets are a significant part of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Related Work)** and **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors discuss various datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 3.4.1, they specifically mention the **ShareGPT4V-PT dataset**, which consists of 1.2 million image-text pairs. This dataset is crucial for the model's training and aligns with the vision-language features.

I will also examine **Table 2 (Datasets)**, which lists multiple datasets used during the multi-task training phase. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Visual Dialog**: 123K samples for conversation tasks.
2. **Text-VQA**: 35K samples for visual question answering.
3. **VSR**: 13K samples for visual spatial reasoning.
4. **IConQA**: 37K samples for visual question answering.
5. **SQA**: 107K samples for science question answering.
6. **COCO**: 592K samples for image captioning.
7. **SBU**: 844K samples for image captioning.

In the **conclusion**, the authors summarize their contributions, which include the effective use of these datasets to improve model performance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:
