To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Density Ratio Estimation for Simultaneous Optimization of Speed and Accuracy" by Akinori F. Ebihara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their method on "one original and two public video databases," which indicates that datasets are involved, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details. Here, the authors mention the use of "Nosaic MNIST, UCF101, and SiW" for their experiments. This gives me the names of the datasets I need to focus on.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in the **experiments section**. They provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Nosaic MNIST (NMNIST)**: A novel dataset created for early-classification tasks, consisting of videos of MNIST handwritten digits buried in noise, which gradually gets denoised over 20 frames.

2. **UCF101**: A well-known action recognition dataset containing 101 action categories, which is used for evaluating the proposed method.

3. **Spoofing in the Wild (SiW)**: A dataset used for face anti-spoofing tasks, containing videos of live and spoofed faces.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **Nosaic MNIST**, since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Akinori F. Ebihara, Taiki Miyagawa, Kazuyuki Sakurai, Hitoshi Imaoka. *Nosaic MNIST: A Novel Early-Classification Database*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, A. R., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. CoRR, abs/1212.0402.

- For **SiW**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Jourabloo, A., & Liu, X. (2018). *Learning deep models for face anti-spoofing: Binary or auxiliary supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
