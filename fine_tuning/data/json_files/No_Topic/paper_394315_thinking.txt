To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Medical Image Segmentation with Sparse Annotation via Cross-Teaching between 3D and 2D Networks" by Heng Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MMWHS dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **MMWHS dataset** in the **experiments section** (section 3.1), where they describe its characteristics and how it was used in their study.

The **MMWHS dataset** is described as being from the MICCAI 2017 challenge, consisting of 20 cardiac CT images with publicly accessible annotations covering seven whole heart substructures. The authors also specify how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MMWHS dataset**. The relevant references are:

- For the **MMWHS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X., & Shen, J. (2016). Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI. *Medical Image Analysis*, 31, 77-87.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure. 

In conclusion, I have identified the **MMWHS dataset** as the primary dataset used in this research, and I have retrieved its full citation. I will now compile this information into the appropriate format for further processing.
