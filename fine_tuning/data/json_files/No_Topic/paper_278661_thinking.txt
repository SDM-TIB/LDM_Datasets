To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determining the atomic charge of calcium ion requires the information of its coordination geometry in an EF-hand motif" by Pengzhi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methodology section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, such as those related to molecular dynamics simulations or quantum mechanical calculations.

I will also check the **Results section** for any additional datasets that may be referenced in the context of the findings. This section often contains data that supports the conclusions drawn by the authors.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the data used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using specific datasets from previous studies or databases, I will ensure to note down the full citation for each of these datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
