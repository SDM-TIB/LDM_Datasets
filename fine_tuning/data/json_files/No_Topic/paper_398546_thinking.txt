To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Trajectory Reconstruction of Drones using a Single Camera" by Seobin Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created synthetic 2D and 3D drone datasets to address the lack of public drone datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they created:

1. **2Drone(on+aug)**: This is a 2D drone image dataset that includes multiple drone models (Airs2S, Mavic3, Mini3, and Tello) with various poses and backgrounds. The dataset consists of 12,541 images and their corresponding ground-truth bounding boxes. The authors mention that this dataset is available online, which is important for citation.

2. **Syn3Drone**: This is a synthetic 3D drone trajectory dataset that provides both 2D image frames and ground-truth 3D positions of drones. The dataset was created using Blender and includes various scenarios with different drone movements. The authors also state that this dataset is available online.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since these datasets are newly created by the authors, they may not have traditional citations like established datasets. Instead, I will note the information provided in the paper regarding their availability.

For the **2Drone(on+aug)** dataset, I will summarize the key details:
- It includes images of four drone models and is available at a specified URL (which is indicated as "will be available" in the text).

For the **Syn3Drone** dataset, I will also summarize:
- It provides 2D image frames and 3D trajectory information, and is similarly available at a specified URL.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and availability links for both datasets, formatted appropriately for clarity and completeness. 

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations as required.
