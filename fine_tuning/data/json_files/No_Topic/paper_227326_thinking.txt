To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoGAN: Latent Graph Co-Attention Network for Weakly-Supervised Video Moment Retrieval" by Reuben Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across two datasets, specifically naming **DiDeMo** and **Charades-STA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors describe both datasets:

1. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is derived from the original Charades dataset, which contains video-level paragraph descriptions and temporal annotations for activities. The Charades-STA dataset consists of 12,408 training query-moment pairs and 3,720 test pairs.

2. **DiDeMo**: The DiDeMo dataset includes videos collected from Flickr, with training, validation, and test sets containing 8395, 1065, and 1004 videos, respectively. Each query in this dataset has temporal annotations from at least four different annotators.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For **Charades-STA**, the citation is:
> Sigurdsson, G.A., Varol, G., Wang, X., Farhadi, A., Laptev, I., Gupta, A. "Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding." In European Conference on Computer Vision (2016).

For **DiDeMo**, the citation is:
> Hendricks, L.A., Wang, O., Shechtman, E., Sivic, J., Darrell, T., Russell, B. "Localizing moments in video with natural language." In International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) (2017).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
