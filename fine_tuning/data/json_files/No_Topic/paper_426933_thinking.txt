To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards White Box Deep Learning" by Maciej Satkiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on sections that are more likely to detail specific datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of deep neural networks and mentions the use of the **MNIST dataset** as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed model. This indicates that MNIST is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically where the author describes the Minimum Viable Dataset (MVD). Here, the author explicitly states that the MVD consists of a binary subset of MNIST, specifically images of the digits "3" and "5". This is a crucial detail as it specifies a particular subset of a well-known dataset.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of the model on the MNIST dataset, confirming its relevance to the experiments conducted. The results indicate that the model achieves high accuracy on both clean and adversarial examples from the MNIST dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MNIST dataset is widely recognized, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset and its binary subset, I will document this dataset accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its full citation for proper attribution. This will be ready for review or further processing.
