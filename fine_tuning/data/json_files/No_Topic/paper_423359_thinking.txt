To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INFFEED: Influence Functions as a Feedback to Improve the Performance of Subjective Tasks" by Somnath Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets related to subjective tasks, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets related to hate speech detection, stance classification, sarcasm, and irony detection. I will take note of each dataset's name and the specific tasks they are associated with.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **HateXplain**: Used for hate speech detection, with a total of 20,148 instances.
2. **Davidson**: Another dataset for hate speech detection, containing 24,802 instances.
3. **WTWT**: Used for stance classification, with 51,284 instances.
4. **Stance**: A dataset for stance classification with 4,163 instances.
5. **iSarcasm**: Used for sarcasm detection, containing 4,484 instances.
6. **Irony**: A dataset for irony detection, with 3,000 instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
