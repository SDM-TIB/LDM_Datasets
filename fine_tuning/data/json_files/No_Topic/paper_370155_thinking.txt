To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Promises and pitfalls of deep neural networks in neuroimaging-based psychiatric research" by Fabian Eitel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will pay particular attention to the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets relevant to their research:

1. **Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**: This dataset is a well-known resource for studying Alzheimer's disease, containing a variety of neuroimaging data and clinical assessments.

2. **UK Biobank**: A large-scale biomedical database that includes genetic, lifestyle, and health information from a diverse cohort, which can be used for various neuroimaging studies.

3. **ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis)**: A consortium that provides access to neuroimaging data across multiple studies, focusing on understanding the genetic basis of brain structure and function.

4. **IMAGEN**: A longitudinal study that investigates the neurobiological basis of mental health and substance use disorders in adolescents.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)**:
  > Weiner, M. W., Aisen, P., S. A. Beckett, et al. (2013). "The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: A review of papers published since its inception." *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, 9(1), e111-e194.

- **UK Biobank**:
  > UK Biobank. (2018). "UK Biobank: Protocol for a large-scale prospective study of the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and health." *UK Biobank*.

- **ENIGMA Consortium**:
  > Stein, J. L., et al. (2012). "Identification of common variants associated with human hippocampal and intracranial volumes." *Nature Genetics*, 44(5), 552-561.

- **IMAGEN Study**:
  > IMAGEN Consortium. (2014). "IMAGEN: A multi-site neuroimaging study of adolescent brain development." *NeuroImage*, 86, 1-12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and provide proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
