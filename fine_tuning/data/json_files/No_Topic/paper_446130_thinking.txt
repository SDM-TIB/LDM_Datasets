To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LPGD: A General Framework for Backpropagation through Embedded Optimization Layers" by Anselm Paulus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the text, along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of these datasets in relation to the research. The experiments section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically includes information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described.

In this paper, the authors mention two specific experiments: one involving a Sudoku dataset and another involving a Markowitz portfolio optimization dataset. I will extract the details of these datasets:

1. **Sudoku Dataset**: The paper describes a dataset consisting of 9000 training and 1000 test instances of Sudoku puzzles. The optimization problem is modeled as a box-constrained linear program, and the authors reference the work of Amos & Kolter (2017) for the training protocol.

2. **Markowitz Portfolio Optimization Dataset**: This dataset is used for tuning a convex optimization control policy based on historical trading data. The authors refer to Agrawal et al. (2020) for a detailed description of this dataset and its application.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the works referenced in relation to these datasets:

- For the **Sudoku dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amos, B., & Kolter, J. Z. (2017). *OptNet: Differentiable optimization as a layer in neural networks*. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017), Sydney, Australia, 6-11 August 2017, pp. 136-145.

- For the **Markowitz portfolio optimization dataset**, the citation is:
  > Agrawal, A., Barratt, S., Boyd, S., and Stellato, B. (2020). *Learning convex optimization control policies*. In Learning for Dynamics and Control, pp. 361-373. PMLR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details from the research paper.
