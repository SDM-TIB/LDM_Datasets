To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Publicly Available Cross-Platform Lemmatizer for Bulgarian" by Grigor Iliev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, implementation, and references sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions a comparison to the **BulTreeBank-Morph**, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation section**, where the authors discuss the BGLemmatizer package and its reliance on two lexical resources: **BG Office** and **Bulgarian-language Wiktionary**. I will look for any specific details about these resources that could qualify them as datasets.

In the **implementation section**, the authors mention that the BGLemmatizer uses lexical resources from both the BG Office project and the Bulgarian-language Wiktionary project. They provide information about the number of lemmas and inflected forms available, which suggests that these resources are substantial datasets for Bulgarian language processing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **BulTreeBank-Morph**: The paper references this dataset as a comparison point for the accuracy of their lemmatizer. However, the full citation is not provided in the text, so I will need to look for it in external sources or databases.

2. **BG Office**: This project is mentioned as a source of lexical resources, but again, a specific citation is not provided in the paper. I will need to find the relevant citation for the BG Office project.

3. **Bulgarian-language Wiktionary**: Similar to the above, this resource is mentioned but lacks a formal citation in the paper. I will also need to find the citation for this project.

After gathering the necessary citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. 

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
