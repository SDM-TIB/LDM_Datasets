To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Size to Depth: A New Perspective for Single Image Estimation" by Yiran Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of depth estimation and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In **subsection 4.2 (Performance on NYU Depth dataset)**, the authors mention using the **NYU Depth dataset** for their experiments. They describe how their method was applied to this dataset and provide some results, which confirms its use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NYU Depth dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In ECCV, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the NYU Depth dataset is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the NYU Depth dataset as required. This will provide a clear and complete overview of the dataset used in the study.
