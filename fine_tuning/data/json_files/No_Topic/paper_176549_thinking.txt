To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Person Re-identification in the Wild" by Liang Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that a new dataset, **PRW**, is introduced for evaluating person re-identification in the wild, which indicates that this is a key dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The PRW Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the PRW dataset as containing 932 identities and 11,816 frames, with annotations for pedestrian bounding boxes and identities. This section will provide the necessary details for describing the dataset.

In addition to PRW, I will check **Table 1** in the paper, which compares PRW with existing datasets. The table lists several other datasets, including:

1. **CAMPUS Dataset**: Contains 214 frames and 74 identities.
2. **Market-1501 Dataset**: A well-known dataset with 1,501 identities and 32,668 annotated boxes.
3. **EPFL Dataset**: Contains 80 frames and 30 identities.
4. **RAiD Dataset**: Contains 43 identities and 6,920 annotated boxes.
5. **VIPeR Dataset**: Contains 632 identities and 1,264 annotated boxes.
6. **CUHK03 Dataset**: Contains 1,360 identities and 13,164 annotated boxes.

I will gather the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper, including the number of frames, identities, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain full citations for each dataset. The citations will be crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For the **PRW dataset**, the citation is:

For the **Market-1501 dataset**, the citation is:

For the **CUHK03 dataset**, the citation is:
> Wu, Y., & Wang, Y. (2016). *Person re-identification: Past, present and future*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02984.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
