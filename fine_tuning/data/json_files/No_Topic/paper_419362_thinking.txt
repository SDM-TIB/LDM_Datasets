To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing End-to-End Multi-Task Dialogue Systems: A Study on Intrinsic Motivation Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Improved Training and Adaptability" by Navin Kamuni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions findings on the **MultiWOZ dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Empirical Study)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **MultiWOZ Dataset**: This dataset includes about 8000 human-to-human dialogue examples from an information center, spanning seven categories such as attraction, hotel, and restaurant. It is commonly used in task-oriented dialogue system research and includes annotations for starting aims, user utterances, and system conversation acts.

2. **Convlab-2**: While not a dataset itself, it is an open-source dialogue systems library that supports multiple datasets, including **DealOrNoDeal**, **CamRest676**, and **CrossWOZ**. However, the paper primarily focuses on the **MultiWOZ dataset** for its experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **MultiWOZ dataset** is:

- For **MultiWOZ Dataset**:
  > Budzianowski, P., et al. "MultiWoz - A large-scale multi-domain wizard-of-oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling." In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2018, pp. 5016â€“5026. doi: 10.18653/v1/d18-1547.

The **Convlab-2** library is referenced as well, but since it is not a dataset, I will not include it in the dataset extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the **MultiWOZ dataset** as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for the datasets utilized in the research.
