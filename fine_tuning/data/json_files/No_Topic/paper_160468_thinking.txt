To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Inference of Cross-modal Connection Topologies for X-CNNs" by Laurynas Karazija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, evaluation, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used in prior work or the current study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets, especially in the context of the challenges faced in training deep learning models with limited data. The authors mention the use of cross-modal convolutional networks (X-CNNs) and refer to the need for labeled data, which suggests that datasets are crucial to their work.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors describe their approaches and may reference specific datasets they utilized in their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors compare their methods against existing models and may provide details about the datasets used for these comparisons. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as they often include dataset names.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset used for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Retrieved from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Retrieved from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Both datasets are referenced in the context of the experiments conducted in the paper, confirming their relevance to the authors' evaluations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
