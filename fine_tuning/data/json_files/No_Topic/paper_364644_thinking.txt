To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coordinate-Based Seismic Interpolation in Irregular Land Survey: A Deep Internal Learning Approach" by Paul Goyes-Peñaﬁel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning for seismic data interpolation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on three different datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated from an acoustic forward modeling operator from DEVITO, specifically designed for irregular acquisition scenarios. The details include 900 time samples, 101 receivers, and 14 shots, with specific missing shots indicated.

2. **Stratton Survey Dataset**: This is a real 3D land swath acquisition project from South Texas. The dataset is rearranged as a cross-spread and consists of 1001 time samples, 90 receivers, and 10 sources. The authors mention that two shots were removed for the interpolation challenge.

3. **SEAM Phase II Foothills Model Dataset**: This dataset simulates a complex geological model in the Llanos Foothills of the Andes Mountains. It includes 128 time samples, 128 receivers, and 7 shots, with two shots removed for the experiment.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For the **Stratton Survey Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hardage, B. "Stratton 3D survey." Tinker, 2021. Available online: https://dataunderground.org/no/dataset/stratton, accessed 29 January 2021.

- For the **SEAM Phase II Foothills Model Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Regone, C., Stefani, J., Wang, P., Gerea, C., Gonzalez, G., and Oristaglio, M. "Geologic model building in SEAM Phase II — Land seismic challenges." The Leading Edge, vol. 36, no. 9, pp. 738–749, 2017.

The **Synthetic Dataset** does not have a specific citation as it is generated from a modeling operator (DEVITO), but I will note that it is based on the work of DEVITO.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
