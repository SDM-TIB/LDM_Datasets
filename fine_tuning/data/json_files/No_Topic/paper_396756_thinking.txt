To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Head-to-Tail: How Knowledgeable are Large Language Models (LLMs)?" by Kai Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a benchmark consisting of **18K question-answer (QA) pairs**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Head-to-Tail Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the benchmark consists of QA pairs generated from various domains and data sources. Specifically, they list the following datasets:

1. **DBpedia**: The authors used a cleaned version of the English snapshot from December 1, 2022, as a source for generating questions. This dataset is crucial as it provides a wide range of knowledge extracted from Wikipedia.

2. **IMDb**: They utilized a snapshot of IMDb from May 21, 2023, specifically for the Movie domain. This dataset is significant for generating questions related to movies and their attributes.

3. **Goodreads**: The data from Goodreads, scraped in 2017 and released by Wan and McAuley (2018), was used for the Book domain. This dataset is essential for questions related to books and authors.

4. **MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph)**: The authors used a snapshot from September 13, 2021, for the Academics domain. This dataset is important for academic-related questions.

5. **DBLP**: A snapshot from May 10, 2023, was also used for the Academics domain, providing additional academic data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **DBpedia**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
