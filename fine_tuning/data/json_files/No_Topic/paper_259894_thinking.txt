To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mood Classification Using Listening Data" by Filip Korzeniowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compiled a subset of the **Million Song Dataset** (MSD) with expert annotations of moods from AllMusic, indicating that this is a significant dataset for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3), where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention the creation of the **AllMusic Mood Subset (AMS)**, which consists of 66,993 matched tracks from the MSD linked with mood annotations from AllMusic. This is a key dataset for their experiments.

In Section 3.1, the authors elaborate on the mood data, stating that it includes 188 mood tags annotated by experts. This further confirms the importance of the AMS dataset.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also utilize listening data from the **Taste Profile** subset of the MSD, which contains over 28 million play counts associated with listeners and tracks. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of mood classification based on listening behavior.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **Million Song Dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P. W., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). The Million Song Dataset. In Proceedings of the 12th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), Miami, USA, October 2011.

2. For the **AllMusic Mood Subset (AMS)**, since it is derived from the MSD and AllMusic annotations, I will cite it as follows:
   > Korzeniowski, F., Nieto, O., McCallum, M. C., Won, M., Oramas, S., & Schmidt, E. M. (2020). Mood Classification Using Listening Data. In Proceedings of the 21st International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR), MontrÃ©al, Canada.

3. For the **Taste Profile** dataset, I will reference it as:
   > Hu, Y., Volinsky, C., & Koren, Y. (2008). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In 2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, Pisa, Italy, December 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the names, descriptions, and citations of each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are clearly documented and can be referenced appropriately in future research.
