To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Neural Hidden Markov Models" by Ke Tran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses evaluating the approach on tag induction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this task.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their approach on the **WSJ corpus** for part-of-speech tag induction. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being used.

I will then check the **references** section to find the full citation for the WSJ corpus. The WSJ corpus is a well-known dataset in natural language processing, and its citation is typically included in the literature.

The citation for the WSJ corpus is:
> Marcus, M. P., Kim, G., Marcinkiewicz, M. A., MacIntyre, R., Bies, A., Ferguson, M., Katz, K., & Schasberger, B. (1994). The Penn Treebank: Annotating Predicate Argument Structure. In Proceedings of the ARPA Human Language Technology Workshop.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The WSJ corpus is widely used for part-of-speech tagging and contains a large number of sentences annotated with part-of-speech tags.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
