To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical properties of market collective responses" by Shanshan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract discusses the analysis of price and liquidity responses, which suggests that there may be datasets related to market data.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data description)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Data set)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their empirical analysis. Here, they mention the **TotalView-ITCH data set**, which features 96 stocks from the NASDAQ 100 index. This section provides details about the dataset, including its resolution and the time period covered.

In **subsection 2.2 (Data processing)**, the authors elaborate on how they processed the data, but this does not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the TotalView-ITCH dataset as the primary dataset used in the study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citation for the TotalView-ITCH dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is a proprietary dataset from NASDAQ. I will note that the dataset is referenced in the context of the analysis but lacks a formal citation.

Since the TotalView-ITCH dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

- **TotalView-ITCH Dataset**: This dataset provides detailed information about the order flow of 96 stocks listed in the NASDAQ 100 index, with a resolution of one millisecond. The data covers five trading days from March 7th to March 11th, 2016, during the intraday trading time from 9:40 to 15:50 EST.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset's name and description, while also acknowledging the lack of a formal citation for the TotalView-ITCH dataset.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on section 2 for dataset details.
3. Identify the TotalView-ITCH dataset as the primary dataset used.
4. Note the absence of a formal citation for the dataset.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
