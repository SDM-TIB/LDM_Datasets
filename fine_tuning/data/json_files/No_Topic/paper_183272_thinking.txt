To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer Aided Restoration of Handwritten Character Strokes" by Barak Sober and David Levin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often contextualizes the work, potentially mentioning datasets used for analysis or comparison.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the restoration of approximately 1000 ancient Hebrew characters, which suggests that there is a dataset of these characters. I will look for specific references to this dataset or any other datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they applied their algorithm to. They mention using characters from various ostraca excavated in Tel Arad, which indicates that these characters form a dataset.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they may contain additional information about datasets or visual representations of the data used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several sources related to the ancient Hebrew inscriptions and the methodology used in their research.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the datasets as follows:

1. **Ancient Hebrew Characters Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 1000 ancient Hebrew characters from various ostraca, specifically from Tel Arad and other locations. The authors indicate that these characters were used to test their restoration algorithm.

2. **Tel Arad Inscriptions**: The paper mentions that the characters reconstructed were excavated in Tel Arad during the 1960s by Yohanan Aharoni. This provides a historical context for the dataset.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Tel Arad Inscriptions**, the citation is:
  > Y. Aharoni, J. Naveh, *Arad Inscriptions*, Israel Exploration Society, 1981.

- For the **general methodology and application of the algorithm**, I will cite the paper itself:
  > Barak Sober, David Levin. *Computer Aided Restoration of Handwritten Character Strokes*. Preprint submitted to Elsevier, October 17, 2018.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly articulated and ready for further processing or review.
