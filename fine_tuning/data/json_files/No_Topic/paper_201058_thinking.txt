To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Implicit Backpropagation" by Francois Fagan and Garud Iyengar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training and testing).

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the following subsections:

1. **Datasets**: This section usually lists the datasets used in the experiments. I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.
2. **References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

From the text, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
   - Citation: 
     > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

2. **JSB Chorales**: A dataset used for music prediction tasks, containing various musical pieces.
   - Citation: 
     > Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, Yoshua Bengio, and Pascal Vincent. Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392, 2012.

3. **MuseData**: Another dataset for music prediction, containing a collection of musical scores.
   - Citation: 
     > Boulanger-Lewandowski, N., Bengio, Y., & Vincent, P. (2012). Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392.

4. **Nottingham Dataset**: A dataset for music prediction tasks, similar to the JSB Chorales.
   - Citation: 
     > Boulanger-Lewandowski, N., Bengio, Y., & Vincent, P. (2012). Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392.

5. **Piano-midi.de**: A dataset containing MIDI files for music prediction tasks.
   - Citation: 
     > Boulanger-Lewandowski, N., Bengio, Y., & Vincent, P. (2012). Modeling temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences: Application to polyphonic music generation and transcription. arXiv preprint arXiv:1206.6392.

6. **UCI Datasets**: A collection of 121 classification datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Citation: 
     > Manuel Fernández-Delgado, Eva Cernadas, Senén Barro, and Dinani Amorim. Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems? J. Mach. Learn. Res, 15(1):3133–3181, 2014.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and attributed, allowing readers to access the original sources for further information.
