To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Missing Component in the Bechdel Test Using Principal Component Analysis Method" by Raghav Lakhotia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any mention of datasets used in the study. In this case, the authors mention analyzing **342 movie scripts**, which indicates that a dataset related to movie scripts is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the **Data Collection** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets they utilized. They mention using the **Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus** and merging it with **Kaggle’s The Movies Dataset**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

1. **Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus**: This dataset contains a large collection of conversations extracted from movie scripts, involving 9,035 characters and 220,579 conversational exchanges. It is crucial for analyzing dialogue in films.

2. **Kaggle’s The Movies Dataset**: This dataset provides metadata about movies, including crew information, budget, revenue, and ROI. It is used to gather additional contextual information about the movies analyzed in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Cornell Movie Dialogue Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., Cheng, J., Kleinberg, J., & Lee, L. (2012). *The Cornell Movie-Dialogue Corpus*. Proceedings of ACL.

- For **Kaggle’s The Movies Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Banik, R. (2019). *The Movies Dataset*. Kaggle. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
