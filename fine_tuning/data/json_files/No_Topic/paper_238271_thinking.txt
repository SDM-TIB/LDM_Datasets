To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Hole Geometry on Relative Robustness of In-Painting Networks: An Empirical Study" by Masood Mortazavi and Ning Yan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of image in-painting and mention that they utilize specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit names of datasets or references to them.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (specifically section 2.3), where the authors detail the datasets used for training and testing. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MIT Places Dataset**: The authors state that they used the validation set from this dataset for their experiments. This dataset is known for its large number of images related to scene recognition.

2. **Celeb-A Dataset**: The authors describe using a 90/10 split of this dataset for training and testing, specifically mentioning that they used a random selection of 1024 images for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MIT Places Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Agata Lapedriza, Jianxiong Xiao, Antonio Torralba, and Aude Oliva. *Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 27, pages 487â€“495, Curran Associates, Inc., 2014.

- For the **Celeb-A Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format that highlights their names, descriptions, and citations, ready for further processing or review.
