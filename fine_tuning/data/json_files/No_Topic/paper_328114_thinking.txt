To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Robustness of Sparse Counterfactual Explanations to Adverse Perturbations" by Marco Virgolin and Saverio Fracaros, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created and released code with five datasets enriched with feature-specific annotations for their experiments. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors summarize the datasets in **section 7.1 (Data sets)**, where they list five datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Credit Risk Dataset (Cre)**: Known as South German Credit Data, it is used for evaluating credit risk.
2. **Income Dataset (Inc)**: Often referred to as the Adult or Census income dataset, it is used for predicting income levels.
3. **Housing Price Dataset (Hou)**: Also known as the Boston housing dataset, it is used for housing price prediction.
4. **Productivity Dataset (Pro)**: This dataset concerns the productivity levels of employees in the garment industry.
5. **Recidivism Risk Dataset (Rec)**: Collected by ProPublica, this dataset is used to estimate the risk of re-offending.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
