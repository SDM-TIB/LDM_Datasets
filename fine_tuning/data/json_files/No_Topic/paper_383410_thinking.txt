To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSTEP - Deep Learning-Based Spatio-Temporal End-To-End Perception for Autonomous Vehicles" by Sebastian Huch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a perception architecture called DeepSTEP, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of perception algorithms in autonomous driving, which may lead to references of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention that they will be using their own dataset generated from their research vehicle, which is a significant point. They also indicate that they will be testing their approach on existing datasets, but specific names are not provided in the abstract or introduction.

I will then check the **implementation and application** section, where the authors discuss the data concept used for their approach. They mention that they will publish a novel multi-modal autonomous driving dataset, which is crucial information. However, I need to identify any existing datasets referenced in the paper.

In the **related work** section, the authors reference several well-known datasets in the context of object detection and localization, such as:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: A widely used dataset for various tasks in autonomous driving, including object detection and tracking.
2. **Waymo Open Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for autonomous driving that includes various sensor modalities.
3. **nuScenes**: Another multimodal dataset for autonomous driving that provides a rich set of annotations.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 1231â€“1237, 2013.

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pei Sun, H. Kretzschmar, X. Dotiwalla, et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo Open Dataset." In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2020.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, et al. "nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." In *CVPR*, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes noting that the authors plan to release their own dataset, which is an important aspect of their research but does not have a citation yet since it is forthcoming.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
1. **KITTI Dataset** - Citation provided.
2. **Waymo Open Dataset** - Citation provided.
3. **nuScenes Dataset** - Citation provided.
4. **Novel multi-modal autonomous driving dataset** - No citation yet, as it is planned for future release.

This structured approach ensures that I have captured all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
