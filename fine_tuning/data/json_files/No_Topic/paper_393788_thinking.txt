To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GENERAL PURPOSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (GPAIS): PROPERTIES, DEFINITION, TAXONOMY, OPEN CHALLENGES AND IMPLICATIONS" by Isaac Triguero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction often contains specific mentions of datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. If the authors describe any experiments, they may specify the datasets used for training or evaluation.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of General Purpose Artificial Intelligence Systems (GPAIS) and their properties. The authors may discuss datasets related to AI techniques, benchmarks, or specific applications.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly list datasets, I will note any implied datasets based on the context of the research, such as datasets commonly used in the field of GPAIS or those referenced in the literature.

Once I have gathered all relevant information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are complete and formatted correctly.
