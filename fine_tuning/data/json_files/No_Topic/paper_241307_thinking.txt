To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining the Relationship between Internet and Democracy in Partly Free Countries Using Machine Learning Models" by Mustafa Sagir and Said Varlioglu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study draws upon various databases, which suggests that there are datasets involved. Specifically, it mentions the International Telecommunication Union, Freedom House, and World Bank databases, which are likely to contain relevant data.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **analysis sections**. In this paper, the authors refer to several datasets, including:

1. **International Telecommunication Union (ITU) internet penetration data**: This dataset is used to measure internet penetration levels across countries.
2. **Freedom House Democracy and internet censorship scores**: This dataset provides scores related to democracy and censorship, which are crucial for the study's analysis.
3. **World Bank World Development Index**: This dataset includes various economic and social indicators that are used as control variables in the analysis.
4. **World Bank Governance Index data**: This dataset is used to assess governance quality across different countries.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **International Telecommunication Union (ITU) data**:
  > ITU. 2019. *Measuring digital development: Facts and figures 2019*. https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Pages/facts/default.aspx

- For the **Freedom House Democracy and internet censorship scores**:
  > Freedom House. 2019. *Freedom in the World 2019*. https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Feb2019_FH_FITW_2019_Report_ForWeb-compressed.pdf

- For the **World Bank World Development Index**:
  > World Bank. 2019. *World Development Index Project*. World Bank Documents (2019). http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/

- For the **World Bank Governance Index data**:
  > World Bank. 2019. *Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) Project*. World Bank Documents (2019). https://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for understanding the research's foundation and implications.
