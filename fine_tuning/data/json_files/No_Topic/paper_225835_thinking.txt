To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variable Rate Deep Image Compression With a Conditional Autoencoder" by Yoojin Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for evaluating the proposed image compression model, which indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, they mention using the **Kodak image dataset** for their experiments. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its size, characteristics, and any specific subsets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluated their model on the Kodak image dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of image compression. They mention that they used the Kodak lossless true color image suite, which consists of images that are commonly used for benchmarking image compression algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Kodak dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **Kodak image dataset**:
  > Eastman Kodak. Kodak lossless true color image suite (PhotoCD PCD0992). http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak, 1993.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
