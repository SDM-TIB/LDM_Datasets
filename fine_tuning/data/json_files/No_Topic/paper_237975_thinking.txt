To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resource-Aware Network Topology Management Framework" by Aaqif Afzaal Abbasi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the proposed framework and its evaluation but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Topology Management Framework)**, which may contain details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any references to experimental setups or data used in the evaluation of the proposed framework.

In this section, the authors describe their evaluation setup, mentioning that they conducted performance evaluations using an Intel Xeon CPU and SDN-enabled switches. However, they do not specify any publicly available datasets or benchmarks that were used for their experiments. Instead, they refer to a "Batch workload" for their experiments, but this does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

Since there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and frameworks rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets for their experiments, nor did they reference any datasets from other works. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned or utilized in the experiments of this paper.**
2. **No references to external datasets were found in the cited works.**

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations. My final output will reflect the absence of datasets in this research paper.
