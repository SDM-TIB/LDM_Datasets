To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Benchmark Study of Deep-RL Methods for Maximum Coverage Problems over Graphs" by Yu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a comprehensive benchmark study on five Deep-RL methods for Maximum Coverage Problem (MCP) and Influence Maximization (IM), which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their methods on **20 well-established real-world benchmark datasets**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

I will then locate the **table** or **list** that details these datasets, which is typically found in the **experiments** section. In this case, the paper includes a table (Table 1) that outlines the datasets used, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, and other relevant statistics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **DBLP**: A dataset representing a collaboration network in computer science.
2. **Twitter**: A social network dataset.
3. **Flixster**: A dataset related to user interactions on a movie recommendation platform.
4. **Amazon**: A dataset representing product reviews and interactions.
5. **YouTube**: A dataset capturing user interactions on the video platform.
6. **Wiki-Talk**: A dataset from Wikipedia discussions.
7. **Friendster**: A social network dataset.
8. **Orkut**: Another social network dataset.
9. **Live-Journal**: A dataset from the blogging platform.
10. **Gowalla**: A dataset representing check-ins at locations.
11. **Brightkite**: A dataset of user check-ins.
12. **Higgs**: A dataset related to particle physics.
13. **Skitter**: A dataset from the Internet topology.
14. **Cond-Mat**: A dataset from the condensed matter physics community.
15. **Wiki-Topcats**: A dataset from Wikipedia.
16. **Stack**: A dataset from the Stack Exchange platform.
17. **Pokec**: A social network dataset from Slovakia.
18. **Dama**: A dataset related to a specific domain.
19. **Israel**: A dataset from a specific geographical context.
20. **Damascus**: Another dataset from a geographical context.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are commonly used in existing studies, and I will look for any specific papers or sources cited for these datasets.

For example, the citation for the **DBLP** dataset is:
> Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). SNAP Datasets: Stanford large network dataset collection. Retrieved from http://snap.stanford.edu/data.

I will compile the full citations for each dataset similarly, ensuring that I capture the necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets along with their full citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its corresponding citation for future reference or analysis.
