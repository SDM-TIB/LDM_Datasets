To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-Free Neural Counterfactual Regret Minimization with Bootstrap Learning" by Weiming Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their algorithms. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will examine it thoroughly, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset. I will note down the names of the datasets, their purposes, and any specific attributes that are highlighted by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Leduc Poker," I will look for its citation, which might be something like:
> F. Southey et al., "Bayesâ€™ bluff: opponent modelling in poker," in Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 2005.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the information is presented clearly and accurately.
