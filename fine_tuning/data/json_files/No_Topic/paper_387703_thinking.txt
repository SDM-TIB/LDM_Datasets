To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Autoencoders are Efficient Continual Federated Learners" by Subarnaduti Paul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical evaluations on several continual federated scenarios on both image and binary datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the paper, the authors describe three sequences of unsupervised tasks, which include:

1. **Sequential MNIST**: This dataset consists of 10 distinct digit classes, with 5 consecutive tasks per client, each containing images of a single random digit.

2. **Numerical Binary Data**: This sequence includes four popular binary datasets for distribution estimation, namely:
   - **RCV1**
   - **Adult**
   - **Connect4**
   - **Tretail**

3. **MNIST + EMNIST**: This dataset comprises 36 distinct subsets, including 10 digits and 26 letters, with a total of 215,600 data samples.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments, including the number of tasks, classes, and train-validation-test splits.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 2012.

- For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and André van Schaik. EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373, 2017.

- For **Adult**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. UCI machine learning repository. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences, 2017.

- For **Connect4**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. UCI machine learning repository. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences, 2017.

- For **Tretail**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. UCI machine learning repository. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences, 2017.

- For **RCV1**, the citation is:
  > Benigno Uria, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Karol Gregor, Iain Murray, and Hugo Larochelle. Neural autoregressive distribution estimation. arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.02226, 2016.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
