To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RhythmNet: End-to-end Heart Rate Estimation from Face via Spatial-temporal Representation" by Xuesong Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors built a large-scale multi-modal HR database named **VIPL-HR**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (VIPL-HR Database)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the VIPL-HR database as containing **3,130 face videos from 107 subjects**, recorded under various conditions, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

In addition to VIPL-HR, the authors reference two other public-domain datasets used for evaluation: **MAHNOB-HCI** and **MMSE-HR**. I will extract details about these datasets as well, including their characteristics and how they relate to the authors' experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **VIPL-HR Database**: The authors created this dataset, so I will cite it as follows:
   > Xuesong Niu, Shiguang Shan, Hu Han, and Xilin Chen. *VIPL-HR: A multi-modal database for pulse estimation from less-constrained face video*. In Proceedings of the Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV), 2018.

2. **MAHNOB-HCI Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > M. Soleymani, J. Lichtenauer, T. Pun, and M. Pantic. *A multimodal database for affect recognition and implicit tagging*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 3, no. 1, pp. 42â€“55, 2012.

3. **MMSE-HR Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > S. Tulyakov, X. Alameda-Pineda, E. Ricci, L. Yin, J. F. Cohn, and N. Sebe. *Self-adaptive matrix completion for heart rate estimation from face videos under realistic conditions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
