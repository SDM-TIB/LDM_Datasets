To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Dexterous Grasping of Novel Objects from a Single View" by Umit Rusen Aktas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a dataset generated by a simulator, which is a strong indication that there is a dataset to extract. Specifically, it states that the dataset consists of **2.4 million simulated dexterous grasps** of variations of **294 base objects** drawn from **20 categories**. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the dataset in detail in **section V (The Simulated Grasp Data Set)**. Here, they provide information about how the dataset was generated, including the number of objects, the categories, and the simulation process.

The dataset is divided into two parts:
1. **DS1**: A dataset of **1.28 million simulated grasps** using the first generative model (GM1).
2. **DS2**: An additional dataset of **1.136 million grasps** using the second generative model (GM2).

The authors also mention that the dataset captures variations in both observable and unobservable parameters, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's complexity and applicability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves and not from external sources, I will note that the citation for the dataset is essentially the paper itself. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset as follows:

- For **DS1** and **DS2**, the citation is:
  > Umit Rusen Aktas, Chao Zhao, Marek Kopicki, Ales Leonardis, and Jeremy L. Wyatt. *Deep Dexterous Grasping of Novel Objects from a Single View*. IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the authors.
