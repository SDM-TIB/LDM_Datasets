To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel-based Reconstruction of Graph Signals" by Daniel Romero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. In the abstract, the authors discuss numerical tests with synthetic and real data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their methods and results, which typically include details about the datasets used. I will pay particular attention to any section that discusses experiments, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Bandlimited Signals**: The authors generated synthetic bandlimited signals for their experiments, specifically using Erdős-Rényi random graphs. This dataset is described in the context of their experiments but does not have a formal citation since it is generated data.

2. **Real Data from U.S. Airports**: The authors used departure and arrival information for flights among U.S. airports. They mention that the dataset contains information about 3 million flights and is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bureau of Transportation, United States. *[Online]. Available: http://www.transtats.bts.gov/, 2016.*

Additionally, the authors reference another dataset related to temperature measurements in Switzerland, which is also used in their experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss. *[Online]. Available: http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/past/climate-normals/climate-diagrams-and-normal-values-per-station.html, 2014.*

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Bandlimited Signals**: Generated data for experiments (no formal citation).
2. **U.S. Airports Flight Data**: 
   > Bureau of Transportation, United States. *[Online]. Available: http://www.transtats.bts.gov/, 2016.*
3. **Temperature Data from Switzerland**: 
   > Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss. *[Online]. Available: http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/home/climate/past/climate-normals/climate-diagrams-and-normal-values-per-station.html, 2014.*

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
