To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Deep Hashing Learning Network" by Guoqiang Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss experiments on several image datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Sets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 70,000 greyscale images of handwritten digits, with a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes of natural objects, with 6,000 images per class, including 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. & Cortes, C. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 1(4), 7.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
