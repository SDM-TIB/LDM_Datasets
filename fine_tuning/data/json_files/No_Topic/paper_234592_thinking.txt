To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Image Compression using Decoder Side Information" by Sharon Ayzik and Shai Avidan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of side information in image compression, which hints at the datasets they might have used for their experiments. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Implementation details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **KITTI Stereo Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1578 stereo pairs taken from calibrated stereo cameras, designed to illustrate the use case of a synchronized camera array.

2. **KITTI General Dataset**: This dataset consists of 789 scenes with 21 stereo pairs per scene, where images are taken from different time steps, simulating a more general case of loosely co-located images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the original KITTI datasets as follows:

- For the **KITTI Stereo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

- For the **KITTI General Dataset**, it is derived from the same source, so the citation remains the same.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
