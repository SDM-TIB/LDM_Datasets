To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dictionary Learning with Uniform Sparse Representations for Anomaly Detection" by Paul Irofti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of dictionary learning for anomaly detection, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context but also lacks specific dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention five datasets used for their numerical experiments:

1. **Satellite Dataset**: This dataset consists of 36 features, with 6,435 samples and 2,036 outliers.
2. **Shuttle Dataset**: This dataset has 9 features, with 49,097 samples and 3,511 outliers.
3. **Pendigits Dataset**: This dataset contains 16 features, with 6,870 samples and 156 outliers.
4. **Speech Dataset**: This dataset has 400 features, with 3,686 samples and 61 outliers.
5. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 features, with 7,603 samples and 700 outliers.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets belong to the publicly available Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS). Therefore, I will refer to the ODDS website for the appropriate citations.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Satellite Dataset**: 
  > "Satellite Data Set." Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS). Available: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/

- **Shuttle Dataset**: 
  > "Shuttle Data Set." Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS). Available: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/

- **Pendigits Dataset**: 
  > "Pendigits Data Set." Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS). Available: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/

- **Speech Dataset**: 
  > "Speech Data Set." Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS). Available: http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
