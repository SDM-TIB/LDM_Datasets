To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dataflow Dialogue Generation" by Joram Meron and Victor Guimarães, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **MultiWOZ** and **SMCalFlow** domains, which suggests that these may be datasets relevant to the research. I will note these names for further investigation.

Next, I will look into the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss the methodology and experiments. In section 1 (Introduction), the authors reference the **SMCalFlow** dataset as a large dialogue dataset with dataflow annotations. This indicates that it is a significant dataset for their work.

In section 3, the authors discuss the **MultiWOZ** dataset in detail, explaining how it is used in their user simulator implementation. This section provides insights into how the dataset is structured and its relevance to their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that both datasets are utilized in the research. The authors mention generating dialogues for both the **MultiWOZ** and **SMCalFlow** domains, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **MultiWOZ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Budzianowski, P., Wen, T.-H., Tseng, B.-H., Casanueva, I., Ultes, S., Ramadan, O., and Gašić, M. (2018). MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain task-oriented dialogue modelling. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Brussels, Belgium.

2. For the **SMCalFlow dataset**, the citation is:
   > Semantic Machines et al. (2020). Task-oriented dialogue as dataflow synthesis. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 8:556–571.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include all relevant details as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset and formatting them according to the specified requirements for downstream processing.
