To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Knowledge-Centric Process Mining" by Asjad Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions that the approach is validated on a **sepsis event-log taken from a standard repository**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **evaluation sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of process mining in real-world settings and mention the use of a sepsis event-log. I will pay close attention to any descriptions or characteristics of this dataset.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide more context about the sepsis event-log, stating that it represents treatment data for **1050 patients over the course of 1.5 years**, with **15,000 events recorded for 16 different activities**. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional details about its structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the sepsis event-log is taken from a standard repository, but it does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself. Therefore, I will need to identify the original source of the sepsis dataset. A commonly referenced dataset in this context is:

- **Sepsis Event-Log**: 
  > Mannhardt, F., & Blinde, D. (2017). Analyzing the trajectories of patients with sepsis using process mining. In RADAR+ EMISA@ CAiSE (pp. 72â€“80).

Since the paper does not provide a direct citation for the dataset, I will use this reference as it is relevant to the sepsis event-log discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
