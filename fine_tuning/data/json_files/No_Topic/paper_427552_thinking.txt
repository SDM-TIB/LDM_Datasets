To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistep Inverse Is Not All You Need" by Alexander Levine et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics. I will look for sections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experimental Setup," or similar headings.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their use in the experiments. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down the key characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific features that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others. I will look for any papers or resources that are cited as the source of the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
