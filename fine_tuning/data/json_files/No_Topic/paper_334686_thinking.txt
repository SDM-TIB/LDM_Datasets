To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visualizing Global Explanations of Point Cloud DNNs" by Hanxiao Tan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of point clouds in various applications but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using **ModelNet40** and **ShapeNet** as datasets for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets and look for more detailed descriptions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: The citation is:
   > Zhirong Wu et al. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2015.

2. **ShapeNet**: The citation is:
   > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

- **ModelNet40**: A dataset containing 12,311 CAD models in 40 common classes, widely used for point cloud classification tasks.
- **ShapeNet**: A dataset composed of 45,969 point cloud instances across 55 classes, with 35,708 for training and 10,261 for testing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
