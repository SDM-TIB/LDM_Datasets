To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparison of Label-Synchronous and Frame-Synchronous End-to-End Models for Speech Recognition" by Linhao Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three public datasets and a large-scale dataset with 12,000 hours of training data**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Librispeech**: An English read-speech dataset containing 960 hours of training data.
2. **AISHELL-2**: A Mandarin read-speech dataset containing 1,000 hours of training data.
3. **HKUST**: A Mandarin telephone ASR benchmark containing 168 hours of training data.
4. **CN12000h**: A large Mandarin ASR dataset with approximately 12,000 hours of training data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Librispeech**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For **AISHELL-2**, the citation is:
  > J. Du, X. Na, X. Liu, and H. Bu. *AISHELL-2: Transforming Mandarin ASR Research into Industrial Scale*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.10583, 2018.

- For **HKUST**, the citation is:
  > Y. Liu, P. Fung, Y. Yang, C. Cieri, S. Huang, and D. Graff. *HKUST/MTS: A Very Large Scale Mandarin Telephone Speech Corpus*. In Proceedings of the International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing (ISCSLP), pages 724–735, 2006.

- For **CN12000h**, while it is mentioned as a large-scale dataset, the paper does not provide a specific citation for it. I will note that it is a large Mandarin ASR dataset with 12,000 hours of training data.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
