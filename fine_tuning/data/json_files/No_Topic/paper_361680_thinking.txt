To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Private optimization in the interpolation regime: faster rates and hardness results" by Hilal Asi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, or references to prior works that might indicate the datasets used.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss **related work** or **background**, as these sections often cite foundational datasets that are relevant to the current research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets that might be referenced in the context of differential privacy or stochastic convex optimization, as these are the main themes of the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.

Now, I will proceed to extract the datasets from the paper based on the steps outlined above.
