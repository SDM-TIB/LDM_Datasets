To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOC-Search: Efficient CAD Model and Pose Retrieval from RGB-D Scans" by Stefan Ainetter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of CAD models and RGB-D scans, which suggests that datasets related to these elements might be discussed. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of datasets in computer vision, specifically mentioning several datasets that are commonly used in the field.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ScanNet**: This dataset is described as providing RGB-D scans of 312 real-world indoor scenes. It is crucial for evaluating the proposed method.

2. **Scan2CAD**: This dataset is referenced as providing CAD model annotations for 3184 objects in the ScanNet validation set. It is used to assess the accuracy of CAD model retrieval.

3. **ShapeNet**: This dataset serves as the CAD model database for retrieval, consisting of 32,535 different models for the object categories present in ScanNet.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X. Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Scan2CAD**, the citation is:
  > Armen Avetisyan, Manuel Dahnert, Angela Dai, Manolis Savva, Angel X. Chang, and Matthias Nießner. *Scan2CAD: Learning CAD Model Alignment in RGB-D Scans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, and Others. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. In arXiv Preprint, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
