To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TableParser: Automatic Table Parsing with Weak Supervision from Spreadsheets" by Susie Xi Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they compiled for training, fine-tuning, testing, and evaluating TableParser. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their names, sizes, and purposes.

In section 3, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **ZHYearbooks-Excel**: This dataset is divided into three subsets: ZHYearbooks-Excel-WS (16,041 tables), ZHYearbooks-Excel-FT (17 tables), and ZHYearbooks-Excel-Test (20 tables). The authors note that it takes an average of 3 minutes and 30 seconds to annotate a table.

2. **ZHYearbooks-OCR**: This dataset includes ZHYearbook-OCR-Test, which consists of 20 tables. The average annotation time is 2 minutes and 45 seconds.

3. **EUYearbooks-OCR**: This dataset is split into EUYearbook-OCR-FT (17 tables) and EUYearbook-OCR-Test (10 tables). The authors mention that these datasets contain various languages and formats, with an average annotation time of 8 minutes and 15 seconds.

4. **Miscellaneous historical yearbooks**: The authors mention running their models on various historical yearbooks, but they do not provide specific dataset names or sizes for this category.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets created by the authors themselves (like ZHYearbooks-Excel and EUYearbooks-OCR) may not have formal citations in the references, as they are original contributions.

For the datasets that do have citations, I will ensure to format them correctly. If the authors reference any existing datasets, I will extract those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the information provided by the authors.
