To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Data-driven Quality Assessment for Continuous Manufacturing of Carbon Nanotube Buckypaper" by Xinran Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a quality assessment methodology based on in-line Raman spectroscopy, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Raman spectra.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results and discussion sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the need for a systematic quality assessment of CNT buckypaper, which implies that they may have collected data for this purpose.

In the **case study section**, the authors describe the experimental setup and data collection process. They mention that Raman spectra were collected from various samples of CNT buckypaper, specifically noting that they collected data from raw SWCNT, acid-treated SWCNT, and functionalized SWCNT. This indicates that there are at least three datasets related to these different materials.

I will also check the **supplementary materials and references** for any additional datasets or related studies that may provide further context or data. The authors reference various studies that may have datasets relevant to their work.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Raman Spectra of Raw SWCNT Buckypaper**: This dataset includes the Raman spectra collected from raw single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper samples.

2. **Raman Spectra of Acid-Treated SWCNT Buckypaper**: This dataset includes the Raman spectra collected from single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper samples that have undergone acid treatment.

3. **Raman Spectra of Functionalized SWCNT Buckypaper**: This dataset includes the Raman spectra collected from single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper samples that have been functionalized.

Next, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The relevant citations are:

- For the Raman spectra of raw SWCNT buckypaper:
  > Krueger, A. (2010). *Carbon Materials and Nanotechnology*. John Wiley & Sons.

- For the Raman spectra of acid-treated SWCNT buckypaper:
  > Park, J. G., Li, S., Liang, R., Zhang, C., & Wang, B. (2008). *Structural changes and Raman analysis of single-walled carbon nanotube buckypaper after high current density induced burning*. Carbon, 46(9), 1175-1183.

- For the Raman spectra of functionalized SWCNT buckypaper:
  > Xu, G., Zhang, Q., Zhou, W., Huang, J., & Wei, F. (2008). *The feasibility of producing MWCNT paper and strong MWCNT film from VACNT array*. Applied Physics A, 92(3), 531-539.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation for future reference.
