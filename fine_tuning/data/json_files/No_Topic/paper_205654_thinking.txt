To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Block-wise Partitioning for Extreme Multi-label Classification" by Yuefeng Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on benchmark multi-label datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table 1) in the **experiments section** that lists the datasets used for evaluation. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **AmazonCat-13K**: This dataset contains 1,186,239 training samples, 306,782 testing samples, 203,882 features, and 13,330 labels.
2. **Wiki10-31K**: This dataset has 14,146 training samples, 6,616 testing samples, 101,938 features, and 30,938 labels.
3. **Delicious-200K**: This dataset includes 196,606 training samples, 100,095 testing samples, 782,585 features, and 205,443 labels.
4. **WikiLSHTC-325K**: This dataset consists of 1,778,351 training samples, 587,084 testing samples, 1,617,899 features, and 325,056 labels.
5. **Amazon-670K**: This dataset has 490,449 training samples, 153,025 testing samples, 135,909 features, and 670,091 labels.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field of extreme multi-label classification, they may not have specific citations in the references. Instead, I will note that they are sourced from the Extreme Classiﬁcation Repository, as mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset information along with the relevant citations:

- For **AmazonCat-13K**, the citation is:
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems, pages 165–172. ACM, 2013.

- For **Wiki10-31K**, the citation is:
  > Rahul Agrawal, Archit Gupta, Yashoteja Prabhu, and Manik Varma. *Multi-label learning with millions of labels: Recommending advertiser bid phrases for web pages*. In Proceedings of the 22nd international conference on World Wide Web, pages 13–24. ACM, 2013.

- For **Delicious-200K**, the citation is:
  > Robert Wetzker, Carsten Zimmermann, and Christian Bauckhage. *Analyzing social bookmarking systems: A del. icio. us cookbook*. In Proceedings of the ECAI 2008 Mining Social Data Workshop, pages 26–30, 2008.

- For **WikiLSHTC-325K**, the citation is:
  > Ioannis Partalas et al. *LSHTC: A benchmark for large-scale text classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1503.08581, 2015.

- For **Amazon-670K**, the citation is:
  > Ian EH Yen et al. *PPD-Sparse: A parallel primal-dual sparse method for extreme classification*. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 545–553. ACM, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset along with its citation for further processing or review.
