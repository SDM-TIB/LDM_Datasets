To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grounded Human-Object Interaction Hotspots from Video" by Tushar Nagarajan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on two diverse video datasets: **OPRA** and **EPIC-Kitchens**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly describe both datasets:

1. **OPRA Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos of product reviews collected from YouTube, with each instance containing a video demonstration of a product's feature paired with a static image of the product, an interaction label, and a manually created affordance heatmap. The authors note that there are approximately 16,000 training instances spanning 7 actions.

2. **EPIC-Kitchens Dataset**: This dataset contains unscripted, egocentric videos of kitchen activities, annotated with action and object labels, along with bounding boxes for objects being interacted with. The dataset includes around 40,000 training instances spanning 352 objects and 125 actions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **OPRA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fang, K., Wu, T.-L., Yang, D., Savarese, S., & Lim, J. J. (2018). Demo2vec: Reasoning object affordances from online videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For the **EPIC-Kitchens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G. M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, W., Price, W., et al. (2018). Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
