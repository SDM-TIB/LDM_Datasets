To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantitative Approximations for Reach-Avoid over General Markov Processes" by Sofie Haesaert, Robert Babuska, and Alessandro Abate, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the study, including any datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section typically outlines the background and context of the research, which may include references to existing datasets that the authors have utilized or built upon.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. They may provide insights into how the datasets were used to validate their methods or present results based on the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution and further research.

Once I have identified the datasets and gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the relevant datasets from the paper effectively and provide the necessary citations for each.
