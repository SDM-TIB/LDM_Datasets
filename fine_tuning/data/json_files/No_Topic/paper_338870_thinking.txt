To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Abadie’s Kappa and Weighting Estimators of the Local Average Treatment Effect" by Tymon Słoczyński, S. Derya Uysal, and Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical applications sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I will need to look for specific datasets in the empirical applications.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of estimating the local average treatment effect (LATE) and mention that they illustrate their findings with three empirical applications. This suggests that datasets will be detailed in the empirical applications section.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Empirical Applications)**, where the authors present three applications: 

1. **Causal Effects of Military Service**: This application uses data from the 1984 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with a sample of 3,027 individuals. The outcome variable is log wage.

2. **Causal Effects of College Education**: This application utilizes data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men (NLSYM) with a subsample of 3,010 individuals. The outcome variable is also log hourly wage.

3. **Causal Effects of Childbearing**: This application is based on a subsample of the 1980 US Census, consisting of 394,840 women aged 21–35 with at least two children. The outcomes of interest are log annual income and labor force participation.

Now, I will compile the details of each dataset, including their full citations from the references section:

1. **Dataset for Causal Effects of Military Service**:
   - **Citation**: Angrist, J. D. (1990). "Lifetime Earnings and the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery: Evidence from Social Security Administrative Records." *American Economic Review*, 80(3), 313-336.

2. **Dataset for Causal Effects of College Education**:
   - **Citation**: Card, D. (1995). "Using Geographic Variation in College Proximity to Estimate the Return to Schooling." In Louis N. Christofides, E. Kenneth Grant, and Robert Swidinsky (Eds.), *Aspects of Labour Market Behaviour: Essays in Honour of John Vanderkamp*. Toronto–Buffalo–London: University of Toronto Press, pp. 201-222.

3. **Dataset for Causal Effects of Childbearing**:
   - **Citation**: Angrist, J. D., & Evans, W. N. (1998). "Children and Their Parents’ Labor Supply: Evidence from Exogenous Variation in Family Size." *American Economic Review*, 88(3), 450-477.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the paper.
