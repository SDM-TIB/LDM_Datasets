To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of the interactive Leipzig Corpus Miner as a generic research platform for the use in the social sciences" by Christian Kahmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the interactive Leipzig Corpus Miner (iLCM) but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of computational methods in social sciences but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Exemplary study)**, where the authors describe the TRANSNORMS project. Here, they mention the use of **Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)** as the data basis for their analysis. This indicates that the NDC texts are a dataset used in their research.

I will then look for any details about the NDC dataset, including its characteristics and how it was utilized in the study. The authors explain that the NDC texts were imported into the iLCM for analysis, and they highlight the importance of a variable import interface that allows different document types to be uploaded. However, they do not provide specific details about the size or structure of the NDC dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NDC dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the NDCs, but they reference the TRANSNORMS project website, which may contain relevant information about the dataset.

The citation for the TRANSNORMS project is:
> TRANSNORMS project. Available at: https://www.transnorms.eu

Since the NDCs are publicly available documents submitted by countries, I will note that they can be cited as:
> United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Available at: https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/NDCStaging/Pages/home.aspx

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered. The NDC dataset will be described with its citation, and I will ensure that the citation is formatted correctly for clarity.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary citations are included.
