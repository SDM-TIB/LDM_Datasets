To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class Introspection: A Novel Technique for Detecting Unlabeled Subclasses by Leveraging Classifier Explainability Methods" by Patrick Kage and Pavlos Andreadis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for detecting latent structures within datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of detecting latent structures in datasets, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** and **experimentation sections**.

In **section 4.2 (MNIST dataset)**, the authors explicitly state that they are using the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 handwritten digits (0 through 9) as 28x28 pixel monochrome images. This is a well-known dataset in machine learning, and it is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation is as follows:
> LeCun, Y., and Cortes, C. 2010. MNIST handwritten digit database.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the MNIST dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entry in the specified format.
