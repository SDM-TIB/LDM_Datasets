To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Languages Are Created Equal in LLMs: Improving Multilingual Capability by Cross-Lingual-Thought Prompting" by Haoyang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. This is typically where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

From the paper, I identify several datasets mentioned:

1. **MGSM (Mathematical Generalization and Semantic Matching)**: This dataset is used for arithmetic reasoning tasks and covers 11 languages. The authors mention that it contains grade school mathematical problems.

2. **XCOPA (Cross-lingual Causal Reasoning)**: This dataset is used for commonsense reasoning tasks and includes 11 languages. It consists of premises and two choices, asking the model to determine the cause or result.

3. **XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for natural language inference tasks and covers 15 languages. It requires the model to determine the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis.

4. **PAWS-X (Paraphrase Identification)**: This dataset is used for paraphrase identification tasks and includes 7 languages. It consists of pairs of sentences that the model must judge as paraphrases or not.

5. **MKQA (Multilingual Knowledge Question Answering)**: This dataset is used for open-domain question answering tasks and covers 25 languages. It includes questions that require short answers.

6. **XL-Sum**: This dataset is used for multilingual summarization tasks and includes 44 languages. It consists of long articles that need to be summarized into shorter texts.

7. **FLORES**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks and includes parallel text from Wikimedia projects for 204 languages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as identified in the references. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
