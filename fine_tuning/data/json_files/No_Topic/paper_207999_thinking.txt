To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Area-preserving mapping of 3D ultrasound carotid artery images using density-equalizing reference map" by Gary P. T. Choi, Bernard Chiu, and Chris H. Rycroft, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a mapping technique on **20 carotid surface models**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Materials and Methods section**. Here, the authors describe the study subjects and the acquisition of **3D ultrasound images**. They mention that **ten subjects with carotid atherosclerosis** were recruited, and each subject was scanned at baseline and two weeks later, resulting in **20 carotid ultrasound images** for evaluation.

In the **Results section**, the authors present findings based on the **20 carotid models** constructed from the ultrasound images. This confirms that the dataset consists of these images.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets used. The paper cites previous works that describe the methods for reconstructing 3D carotid surfaces and the construction of VWT maps. However, it does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is based on the authors' own data collection.

Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own research, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **Carotid Ultrasound Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 3D ultrasound images of carotid arteries obtained from ten subjects with carotid atherosclerosis. Each subject was scanned at baseline and two weeks later.

As there are no external citations for this dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors for their study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
