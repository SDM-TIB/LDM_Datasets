To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosted Generative Models" by Aditya Grover and Stefano Ermon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their algorithms on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in section 4.2 (Density estimation on benchmark datasets) and section 4.3 (Classification). The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Accidents Dataset**: This dataset is used for density estimation and classification tasks. It contains various features related to accidents.

2. **Retail Dataset**: Another dataset used for density estimation and classification, containing retail transaction data.

3. **Pumsb-star Dataset**: This dataset is used for both density estimation and classification, consisting of census data.

4. **DNA Dataset**: A dataset used for density estimation, which contains DNA sequences.

5. **Kosarek Dataset**: This dataset is used for density estimation and classification, containing user-item interactions.

6. **Ad Dataset**: A dataset used for density estimation and classification, which contains advertising data.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, so I will look for any references that point to the original sources of these datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Here are the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Accidents Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- **Retail Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- **Pumsb-star Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- **DNA Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- **Kosarek Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

- **Ad Dataset**: 
  > Van Haaren, J., & Davis, J. (2012). Markov network structure learning: A randomized feature generation approach. In AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
