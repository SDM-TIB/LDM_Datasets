To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OpenICS: Open Image Compressive Sensing Toolbox and Benchmark" by Jonathan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and benchmarks sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted a benchmarking study on methods evaluated on six different datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the benchmarking process. They mention using six widely used datasets for evaluation: **MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR10 (grayscaled), CelebA, Bigset, and Bigset (grayscaled)**. I will note these datasets down as they are explicitly listed.

In the **Benchmark section**, the authors provide additional context about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. This section confirms the datasets and provides details about their application in the benchmarking study.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **MNIST**:
   > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR10**:
   > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

3. **CelebA**:
   > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. "Deep learning face attributes in the wild." In *Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, December 2015.

4. **Bigset**:
   > J. Kim, J. Kwon Lee, and K. Mu Lee. "Accurate image super-resolution using very deep convolutional networks." In *Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*, 2016, pp. 1646–1654.

5. **Bigset (grayscaled)**:
   > This is derived from the same sources as Bigset, as it is a variant of the original dataset.

6. **CIFAR10 (grayscaled)**:
   > This is a variant of the CIFAR10 dataset, and the original citation applies.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
