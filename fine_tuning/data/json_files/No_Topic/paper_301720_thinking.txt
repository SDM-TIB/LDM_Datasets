To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Verification in the Loop: Correct-by-Construction Control Learning with Reach-avoid Guarantees" by Yixuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details that help in understanding their context and usage in the research.

In this paper, the authors mention two systems for their experiments: a **linear adaptive cruise control (ACC) system** and a **Van der Pol’s oscillator system**. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets in the text. Instead, they describe the system dynamics and the parameters used for their simulations.

Since there are no datasets explicitly cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the works cited. I will look for any papers that might describe datasets related to the systems they are experimenting with.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works related to safety verification and control systems, but none of them appear to be datasets themselves. Instead, they provide methodologies or frameworks that could be relevant for future work.

Given that there are no specific datasets mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that the authors conducted their experiments using simulated environments rather than publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The experiments were conducted using simulations of the ACC and Van der Pol’s oscillator systems.**
3. **No full citations for datasets can be provided as none were referenced.**

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched for datasets and documented the findings accurately, even if it results in the conclusion that no datasets were used.
