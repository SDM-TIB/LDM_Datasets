To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Micro-Behavior Encoding for Session-based Recommendation" by Jiahao Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **JD-Appliances Dataset**: This dataset contains user interaction sessions from a large Chinese e-commerce site JD.com, specifically in the "Appliances" product category. It includes various micro-behavior operations such as "SearchList2Product" and "Order".

2. **JD-Computers Dataset**: Similar to the JD-Appliances dataset, this dataset also comes from JD.com but focuses on the "Computers" product category. It contains the same types of micro-behavior operations.

3. **Trivago Dataset**: This dataset is provided by Trivago, a global hotel search platform. It includes user actions related to hotel searches and specifies the types of actions performed, such as "interaction item image".

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **JD Datasets** (both Appliances and Computers), the citation is:
  > JD.com. *JD Datasets for Session-based Recommendation*. Available at: https://tinyurl.com/ybo8z4yz.

- For the **Trivago Dataset**, the citation is:
  > RecSys Challenge 2019. *Trivago Dataset*. Available at: http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2019/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining a clear and organized format for future reference or processing.
