To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Multi-scale Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Fast Object Detection" by Zhaowei Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors report state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as **KITTI** and **Caltech**, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets. In this paper, the authors evaluate their method on the **KITTI** and **Caltech Pedestrian** datasets. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, the number of samples, and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation** section, the authors provide further insights into the datasets. They mention that the **KITTI** dataset contains three object classes: car, pedestrian, and cyclist, and that it has a total of 7,481 images for training/validation and 7,518 for testing. The **Caltech Pedestrian** dataset is also discussed, indicating that it is used for pedestrian detection tasks.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

For the **Caltech Pedestrian dataset**, the citation is:
> Pedro Dollár, Cristian Wojek, Bernt Schiele, and Pietro Perona. *Pedestrian detection: An evaluation of the state of the art*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 34(4):743–761, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
