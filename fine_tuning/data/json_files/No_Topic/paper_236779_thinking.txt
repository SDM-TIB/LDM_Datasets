To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Back-and-Forth Prediction for Deep Tensor Compression" by Hyomin Choi, Robert A. Cohen, and Ivan V. Bajić, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a method for compressing deep feature tensors and mentions experiments with a state-of-the-art object detector, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **2014 COCO dataset** for training their BaF prediction network and for testing the object detection performance.

I will also check the **prior work section (Section 2)** and the **references section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned or cited. The authors refer to the COCO dataset multiple times, indicating its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **2014 COCO dataset** from the references section:

- For the **2014 COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for both training and testing, I will ensure to highlight this dataset in my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
