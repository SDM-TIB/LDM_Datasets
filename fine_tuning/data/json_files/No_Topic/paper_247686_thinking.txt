To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sustainable Recreational Fishing Using a Novel Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) Lure and Ensemble Network Algorithm to Maximize Catch and Release Survivability" by Petteri Haverinen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a fishing lure and a deep learning system, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. The introduction primarily discusses the context of recreational fishing and the issues surrounding catch and release mortality, but it does not provide specific dataset names.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 2.2 (Data Augmentation)**, the authors mention using the **Open Images Dataset V6** developed by Google. This dataset is crucial as it contains a large number of images of various fish species, which is relevant for their deep learning model.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the Open Images Dataset V6 and to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The experiments section primarily discusses the performance of the EMS lure and the classification system, but it reiterates the use of the Open Images Dataset for training the model.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Open Images Dataset V6. The citation provided in the references is:
> Open Images V6 - Download, storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html.

Since this is a dataset from Google, I will format the citation appropriately for clarity.

At this point, I have identified the relevant dataset and its citation. I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the Open Images Dataset V6, which is essential for the deep learning model discussed in the research.
