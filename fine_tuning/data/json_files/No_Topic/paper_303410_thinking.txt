To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Generative Network" by Daniel N. Nissani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses generative neural networks and their capabilities, but again, no specific datasets are referenced.

Next, I will look into the **simulation results** section, specifically **section 3**, where the author mentions using the **MNIST dataset** for testing the proposed model. This is a crucial point, as it indicates that the MNIST dataset is a key component of the experiments conducted in this research.

In section 3, the author describes the experiments conducted with the MNIST dataset, detailing the architecture of the neural network and the parameters used. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of handwritten digits, which is commonly used for benchmarking generative models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
