To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuroevolution in Deep Learning: The Role of Neutrality" by Edgar Galván, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the role of evolutionary algorithms in optimizing deep neural networks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (State-of-the-art in Neuroevolution in Deep Neural Networks)**, where the author mentions that "numerous studies used selection and mutation only to drive evolution in automatically finding a suitable deep neural network architecture or to train a neural network." This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In **section 2.1 (Evolving Deep Neural Networks’ Architectures with Evolutionary Algorithms)**, the author refers to benchmark datasets used in experimental analysis. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned here. The text states that "MNIST and CIFAR are the most popular benchmark datasets," which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will also check **section 4 (First Research Steps in Neutrality in Neuroevolution in Deep Neural Networks)** for any additional datasets that may be referenced. However, it appears that the focus remains on the general discussion of neuroevolution rather than specific datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the identified datasets from the **References section**:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
