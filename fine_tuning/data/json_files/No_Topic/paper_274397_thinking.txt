To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Online Deep Learning Approach Toward the Prediction of Power System Stresses Using Voltage Phasors" by Elham Foruzan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **phase angle data from phasor measurement units (PMUs)**, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets. They discuss the importance of monitoring phase angle differences and refer to the **IEEE 118-bus system** and the **PJM Interconnection system** as the testbeds for their framework. This suggests that these systems are likely associated with specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they created a database of operating conditions (OCs) using phase angles from PMUs. They mention that they generated a total of **38400 OCs** for the PJM Interconnection system, which indicates a substantial dataset derived from real-time measurements.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their model on the **IEEE 118-bus system** and the **PJM Interconnection system**, confirming that these datasets were used for training and testing their deep learning model.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **IEEE 118-bus system**: The citation is:
   > "IEEE 118-Bus System - Illinois Center for a Smarter Electric Grid (ICSEG). [Online]. Available: http://icseg.iti.illinois.edu/ieee-118-bus-system/"

2. **PJM Interconnection system**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the PJM dataset, it is a well-known system in power engineering. I will note that it is commonly referenced in literature related to power systems.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
