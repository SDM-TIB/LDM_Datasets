To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Manifolds for Curvature-Aware Graph Embedding" by Francesco Di Giovanni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "synthetic and real datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention using four real-world graphs for reconstruction tasks:

1. **Aves-Wildbird Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a small animal network with 131 nodes and 1444 edges.
2. **CS-PhD Dataset**: This dataset represents an advisor-advisee relationship with 1025 nodes and 1043 edges.
3. **WebEdu Dataset**: This dataset consists of web networks from the .edu domain, containing 3031 nodes and 6474 edges.
4. **Facebook Dataset**: This dataset is a dense social network with 4039 nodes and 88324 edges.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **Aves-Wildbird Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rossi, R. A., & Ahmed, N. K. (2015). The network data repository with interactive graph analytics and visualization. In AAAI.

- For the **CS-PhD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > De Nooy, W., Mrvar, A., & Batagelj, V. (2018). Exploratory social network analysis with Pajek: Revised and expanded edition for updated software. Cambridge University Press.

- For the **WebEdu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gleich, D. F., Zhukov, L., & Berkhin, P. (2004). Fast parallel pagerank: A linear system approach. Yahoo! Research Technical Report YRL-2004-038.

- For the **Facebook Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Mcauley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
