To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable and Efficient Infinite-Order Vector Autoregressive Model for High-Dimensional Time Series" by Yao Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their empirical analysis or simulations. I will pay attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will check for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial as it provides the full citation needed for each dataset. I will ensure to note down the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "US macroeconomic data," I will look for the original source or any related publications that describe this dataset in detail. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or repository where it can be accessed.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future reference or analysis.
