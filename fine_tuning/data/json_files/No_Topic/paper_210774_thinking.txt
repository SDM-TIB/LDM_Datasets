To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Fictitious Self-Play on ELF Mini-RTS" by Keigo Kawamura and Yoshimasa Tsuruoka, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the application of Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) to Mini-RTS, but it does not mention any datasets directly. 

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. In this paper, the authors primarily focus on the Mini-RTS game environment provided by the ELF platform, which is a specific game rather than a traditional dataset. 

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in conjunction with the Mini-RTS environment. However, the references primarily discuss algorithms and frameworks rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets in the traditional sense (like image datasets or benchmark datasets), I will note that the primary focus is on the Mini-RTS game environment itself, which serves as the experimental platform rather than a dataset.

After reviewing the paper, I will conclude that there are no traditional datasets to cite, but I will document the ELF platform and Mini-RTS as the experimental environment used in the research.

The citation for the ELF platform and Mini-RTS is as follows:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
