To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Super-Resolution MRI Using Finite Rate of Innovation Curves" by Greg Ongie and Mathews Jacob, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on simulated single-coil MR data obtained from analytical phantoms, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors discuss their experiments. They mention using "analytical phantoms derived in [7]" for their simulations. This indicates that there is a dataset related to these analytical phantoms that is crucial for their evaluation.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citation of the dataset mentioned. The relevant reference is:

- For the analytical phantoms, the citation is:
  > Matthieu Guerquin-Kern, L Lejeune, Klaas P Pruessmann, and Michael Unser. *Realistic analytical phantoms for parallel magnetic resonance imaging*. In Medical Imaging, IEEE Transactions on, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 626â€“636, 2012.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will focus on this analytical phantom dataset as the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately.
