To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting, Visualizing, and Learning from Dynamic Data: Perfusion in Surgical Video for Tissue Characterization" by Jonathan P. Epperlein et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses capturing information from fluorescence imaging after ICG administration, which suggests that there may be datasets related to tissue characterization.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. I will pay close attention to any references to data collection, patient studies, or specific datasets used for analysis. For instance, the paper mentions using video recordings of tissue perfusion in real patients undergoing surgery, which indicates that there is a dataset derived from these recordings.

In the **clinical application section**, the authors describe the use of video recordings from multiple university hospitals, which implies that there is a dataset that includes these recordings. I will note the number of patients and the types of conditions being studied, as this information is crucial for dataset description.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that may correspond to the datasets used in the study. This could include previous studies that provided the data or methodologies that were adapted for this research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper references a specific dataset related to ICG imaging or a previous study that provided data on tissue perfusion, I will ensure to include the complete citation for that dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its purpose, the type of data it contains, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
