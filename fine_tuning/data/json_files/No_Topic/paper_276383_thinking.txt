To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Site-specific online compressive beam codebook learning in mmWave vehicular communication" by Yuyang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Motivation and Dataset Establishment)**, where the authors describe their simulation setup and how they collect vehicular channel data. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments.

In **Section II-A (Simulation setup)**, the authors mention using **Wireless Insite**, a commercial ray tracing simulator, to establish the channel dataset for evaluation. This indicates that the dataset is derived from simulations rather than real-world data collection.

In **Section II-B (Channel model)**, the authors describe the channel model and the parameters used for the simulations, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they do mention that the channel statistics are based on the ray tracing data collected from the simulation.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets or the simulation tools used. The reference to **Wireless Insite** is crucial as it indicates the source of the simulation data.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Channel Dataset from Wireless Insite**: This dataset is generated using the Wireless Insite ray tracing simulator, which simulates the channel path information, including path gain, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and angle-of-departure (AoD) between the base station and vehicles.

The full citation for the simulator is:
> Wireless Insite. "Wireless Insite: EM Propagation Software." [Online]. Available: https://www.remcom.com/wireless-insite-em-propagation-software/.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets or provide additional citations for datasets, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entries in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
