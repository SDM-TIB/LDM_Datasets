To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Exploiting Hitting Sets for Model Reconciliation" by Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **classical planning problems from the International Planning Competition (IPC)** and **general instances from recent SAT competitions**. These references indicate that they are utilizing datasets derived from these competitions, but I need to find the exact citations for these datasets.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the IPC, I will look for the relevant proceedings or papers that describe the datasets used in the competition. For the SAT competitions, I will similarly search for the appropriate references that detail the datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **International Planning Competition (IPC) Datasets**: I will cite the official proceedings or relevant papers that describe the datasets used in the IPC.

2. **SAT Competition Datasets**: I will find and cite the relevant papers or proceedings that detail the datasets used in the SAT competitions.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly documented with its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
