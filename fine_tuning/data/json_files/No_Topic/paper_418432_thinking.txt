To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LDCA: Local Descriptors with Contextual Augmentation for Few-Shot Learning" by Maofa Wang and Bingchen Yan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the LDCA method on fine-grained classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot learning and the importance of datasets in training models. They mention various applications but do not specify datasets yet. This indicates that I need to look further into the paper.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is derived from ImageNet and includes 100 classes with 600 images each, with a resolution of 84x84 pixels. The authors specify the training, validation, and testing splits.

2. **CUB-200**: A fine-grained bird image classification dataset that includes 200 different bird species. The authors note the number of images varies by class and provide the splits for training, validation, and testing.

3. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset consists of 20,580 photographs across 120 different dog breeds, with specified splits for training, validation, and testing.

4. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained car classification, containing 16,185 images across 196 different car classes, also with specified splits.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In Advances in neural information processing systems (Vol. 29).

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, C., & Perona, P. (2010). Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. 

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Khosla, A., Jayadevaprakash, N., Yao, B., & Li, F.-F. (2011). Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization: Stanford dogs. In Proc. CVPR workshop on fine-grained visual categorization (FGVC).

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). 3D object representations for fine-grained categorization. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision workshops.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
