To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Embeddings and Fuzzy Time Series for High-Dimensional Time Series Forecasting in Internet of Energy Applications" by Hugo Vinicius Bitencourt et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of forecasting energy consumption in smart buildings, which suggests that datasets related to energy consumption are likely to be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the case studies and datasets used for testing their methodology. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **UCI Appliances Energy Consumption (AEC-DS)**: This dataset includes measurements of temperature and humidity collected from a wireless sensor network, along with recorded energy consumption from appliances and lighting fixtures in a low-energy house in Belgium. The dataset contains 19,735 instances with 26 explanatory variables and 1 temporal variable (date/time).

2. **UCI Household Power Consumption (HPC-DS)**: This dataset contains electricity consumption data from a residential house in France, collected over a four-year period with a resolution of one minute. It consists of 2,075,259 instances and 12 variables, including global active power, global reactive power, and submetering data.

3. **Kaggle Smart Home with Weather Information Dataset (SHWI-DS)**: This dataset includes home appliance consumption data and weather data from January 2016 to December 2016, with a frequency of 1 minute. It contains 500,910 instances and 29 variables, including total energy consumption and various weather-related features.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
