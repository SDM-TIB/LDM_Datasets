To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in SNNs with Sparse Gradients" by Yujia Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their approach through experiments on both image-based and event-based datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections, likely in the **Methodology** or **Experiment** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **CIFAR10-DVS** datasets. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors provide a comparison of their method's performance on these datasets. They mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for image classification tasks and the **CIFAR10-DVS** dataset for neuromorphic data. I will ensure to capture the context in which these datasets are used, such as the architectures employed and the types of attacks tested.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR10-DVS**, the citation is:
  > Marchisio, A., Pira, G., Martina, M., Masera, G., and Shafique, M. D. *DVS-Attacks: Adversarial attacks on dynamic vision sensors for spiking neural networks*. In International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, pp. 1â€“9, 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
