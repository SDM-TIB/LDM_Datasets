To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-TTS: Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech" by Sung-Feng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **LibriTTS** and **VCTK** datasets, which suggests that these are important datasets for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly state that they use the **LibriTTS dataset**, which contains around 54 hours of utterances from 247 speakers, and the **VCTK dataset**, which consists of 44 hours from 110 speakers. This confirms their use in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LibriTTS dataset**, the citation is:
   > H. Zen, V. Dang, R. Clark, Y. Zhang, R. J. Weiss, Y. Jia, Z. Chen, and Y. Wu. *LibriTTS: A corpus derived from LibriSpeech for text-to-speech*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, pages 1526â€“1530, 2019.

2. For the **VCTK dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Yamagishi, C. Veaux, and K. MacDonald. *CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR voice cloning toolkit (version 0.92)*. 2019. Available: https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2645.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
