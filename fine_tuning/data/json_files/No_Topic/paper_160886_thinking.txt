To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian variational approximation for high-dimensional state space models" by Matias Quiroz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions two applications: a spatio-temporal model for the Eurasian Collared-Dove and a multivariate stochastic volatility model for financial returns. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **application sections (5 and 6)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their examples. In **Section 5 (Application 1: Spatio-temporal modeling)**, the authors detail the dataset concerning the Eurasian Collared-Dove, which consists of counts observed at various locations over a period from 1986 to 2003. They specify that the dataset includes 111 grid points and the counts are aggregated within each area.

In **Section 6 (Application 2: Stochastic volatility modeling)**, the authors discuss the dataset used for the multivariate stochastic volatility model, which consists of monthly observations on value-weighted portfolios from the CRSP database covering a period from June 2009 to September 2017.

Now, I will extract the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. **Eurasian Collared-Dove Dataset**:
   - Citation: 
     > Wikle, C. K., & Hooten, M. B. (2006). Hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal models for population spread. In Clark, J. S. & Gelfand, A. (Eds.), Applications of computational statistics in the environmental sciences: hierarchical Bayes and MCMC methods (pp. 145–169). Oxford University Press.

2. **Financial Portfolios Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Philipov, A., & Glickman, M. E. (2006b). Multivariate stochastic volatility via Wishart processes. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 24(3), 313–328.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

- **Eurasian Collared-Dove Dataset**: This dataset includes the number of doves observed at 111 locations over 18 years (1986-2003), with counts aggregated within each area.
  
- **Financial Portfolios Dataset**: This dataset consists of monthly observations on value-weighted portfolios from the CRSP database, covering a period from June 2009 to September 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
