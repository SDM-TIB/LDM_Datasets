To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Resilience-Oriented Operation of Micro-Grids in both Grid-Connected and Isolated Conditions within Sustainable Active Distribution Networks" by Saeed Behzadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a convex optimization model and mentions the IEEE 33-bus system, which suggests that this system may be a dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various aspects of resilience in distribution networks and refer to the IEEE 33-bus system as a test case. This indicates that the IEEE 33-bus system is a dataset used for simulations.

In the **numerical study section**, the authors provide detailed information about the IEEE 33-bus system, including its configuration, load parameters, and simulation results. This section confirms that the IEEE 33-bus system is indeed the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 33-bus system. The IEEE 33-bus system is a well-known benchmark in power systems research, and its citation is typically found in literature related to power system analysis.

The citation for the IEEE 33-bus system is:
> Baran, M.E., & Wu, F.F. (1989). Network reconfiguration in distribution systems for loss reduction and load balancing. *IEEE Power Engineering Review*, 9(4), 101-102.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to create an entry for the dataset according to the specified format.

In summary, the key steps I followed were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the numerical study section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry for the IEEE 33-bus system.
