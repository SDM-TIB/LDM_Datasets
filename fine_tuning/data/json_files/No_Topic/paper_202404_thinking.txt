To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding Dory in the Crowd: Detecting Social Interactions using Multi-Modal Mobile Sensing" by Kleomenis Katevas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted a study with 24 participants and collected data using mobile sensing technology, which suggests that a dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the participants and the data collection process. Here, they mention that they collected sensor data from participants during a social networking event, which indicates that a dataset was created from this study.

In **section 4.3 (Sensor Data Set)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the types of data collected, including:

1. **iBeacon Proximity**: This dataset includes the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) from the mobile device with all beacons in range.
2. **Linear Acceleration**: This dataset captures acceleration changes in three-dimensional space, excluding the 1g acceleration due to gravity.
3. **Gravity**: This dataset measures the orientation of the device relative to the ground.
4. **Rotation Rate**: This dataset records the device’s rate of rotation around each of the three spatial axes.

The authors also mention that the dataset contains a total of 645,895 labels for each combination of the 22 valid participants interacting over a total of 45 minutes, which provides further context about the dataset's size and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. However, the paper does not explicitly cite external datasets, as it primarily discusses the dataset generated from their own study.

The dataset created from this study is described as a freely available dataset with unconstrained natural one-to-one and group interactions, which is significant for researchers interested in social interaction analysis.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to credit the authors for their work.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Kleomenis Katevas, Katrin Hänsel, Richard Clegg, Ilias Leontiadis, Hamed Haddadi, and Laurissa Tokarchuk. 2018. Finding Dory in the Crowd: Detecting Social Interactions using Multi-Modal Mobile Sensing. 1, 1 (November 2018), 21 pages. https://doi.org/0000001.0000001

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
