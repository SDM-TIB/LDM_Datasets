To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random cohort effects and age groups dependency structure for mortality modelling and forecasting: Mixed-effects time-series model approach" by Ka Kin Lam and Bo Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and applications sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for empirical studies.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **empirical male and female mortality data** from the **Human Mortality Database** for their analyses. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to extract.

In the **applications section**, the authors specify that the male mortality data is available from the year 1947 to 2016, and the female mortality data is also from the same period. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' temporal scope.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the Human Mortality Database is as follows:
> Human Mortality Database. (2020). University of California, Berkeley (USA), and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (Germany). Available online: https://www.mortality.org/. Accessed on 20 April 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Male Mortality Data**: This dataset includes age-specific male central mortality rates from 1947 to 2016, sourced from the Human Mortality Database.

2. **Female Mortality Data**: Similar to the male dataset, this includes age-specific female central mortality rates from 1947 to 2016, also sourced from the Human Mortality Database.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
