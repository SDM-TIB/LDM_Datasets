To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building powerful and equivariant graph neural networks with structural message-passing" by ClÃ©ment Vignac et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **ZINC dataset** in the context of evaluating their proposed method. They state that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset, which indicates its significance in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the ZINC dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. 

The citation for the ZINC dataset is:
> ZINC: A Benchmark Dataset for Molecular Graph Generation. *https://github.com/jeremytandy/ZINC*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **ZINC Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the constrained solubility of molecules and is a large-scale dataset containing molecular graphs. It is significant for evaluating the performance of graph neural networks in chemistry applications.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
