To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Detecting Rumours in Social Media" by Arkaitz Zubiaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a methodology for collecting and annotating conversational threads related to social media rumours, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the need for an appropriate dataset that includes a diverse set of stories related to social media rumours. They mention the PHEME project, which aims to create datasets of rumours and non-rumours.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach to collecting tweets during the 2014 Ferguson unrest. They specify that they used Twitter's streaming API to collect tweets related to the event, particularly focusing on the hashtag #ferguson. This indicates that the dataset they created is based on tweets collected during this specific event.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of tweets collected, the sampling method, and the annotation process. The authors mention that they collected over 8.7 million tweets and filtered them down to a manageable subset of 12,595 source tweets, which were then annotated for rumourous and non-rumourous content.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are mentioned. The authors reference several studies and methodologies that may provide context or additional datasets relevant to their work.

The key dataset I will extract from this paper is:

1. **Ferguson Twitter Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets collected during the Ferguson unrest from August 9 to August 25, 2014, using the hashtag #ferguson. The authors filtered the dataset to include tweets that sparked significant discussion, resulting in a final set of 12,595 tweets.

The full citation for the dataset is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into the required format for further processing or review.
