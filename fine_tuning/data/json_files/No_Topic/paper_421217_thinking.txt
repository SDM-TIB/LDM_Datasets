To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Building a Semantic Network Inventory for Model-Driven Telemetry" by Ignacio D. Martinez-Casanueva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses the integration and sharing of context information related to model-driven telemetry, which may imply the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific mentions.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **case study** sections, as these often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or experimentation. In this paper, the authors mention a prototype that was validated through a case study involving a heterogeneous network comprising devices from various vendors, specifically Cisco, Huawei, and Nokia. This suggests that there may be datasets related to the performance metrics of these devices.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize data or datasets. For instance, Table I lists the YANG data models supported by different network devices, which could be considered a dataset in the context of this research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or models mentioned. The paper references several standards and models, such as the ETSI CIM standard and the YANG Library module, which may not be datasets in the traditional sense but are crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Here are the key datasets I will extract:

1. **YANG Library Module**: This module is referenced as a standard for managing YANG data models. The citation for this is:
   > Bierman, A., Björklund, M., Schönwälder, J., Watsen, K., & Wilton, R. (2019). *YANG Library*. RFC 8525.

2. **YANG Catalog Module**: This module is mentioned as a reference for the Catalog Domain. The citation is:
   > Clarke, J., & Claise, B. (2018). *YANG module for yangcatalog.org*. Internet-Draft draft-clacla-netmod-model-catalog-03.

3. **Case Study Data**: The paper describes a case study involving devices from Cisco, Huawei, and Nokia. While specific datasets are not explicitly named, the performance metrics collected during the case study could be considered a dataset. However, since no formal dataset is cited, I will note that the data is derived from the experimental setup described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper.
