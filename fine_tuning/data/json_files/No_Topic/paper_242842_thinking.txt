To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Polygonal Building Extraction by Frame Field Learning" by Nicolas Girard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a frame field output for extracting buildings from remote sensing images, which suggests that datasets related to remote sensing images are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the number of images or samples they contain.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset**: This dataset consists of 341,438 aerial images of size 300 × 300 pixels with associated ground truth polygonal annotations.

2. **Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset**: This dataset includes 360 aerial images of size 5000 × 5000 pixels, representing ten different cities. The authors note that the original ground truth is in raster binary masks, but they created two new datasets from it: the Inria OSM dataset (using Open Street Map annotations) and the Inria Polygonized dataset (converting the original binary masks to polygon annotations).

3. **Private dataset**: This dataset comprises 57 satellite images of varying sizes (from 2000×2000 pixels to 20000×20000 pixels) captured over 30 different cities worldwide. The building outline polygons in this dataset were manually labeled by an expert.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **CrowdAI Mapping Challenge dataset**:
  > Prasanna Mohanty. *CrowdAI dataset*. 2018. Retrieved from https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/mapping-challenge/dataset_files.

- For the **Inria Aerial Image Labeling dataset**:
  > Emmanuel Maggiori, Yuliya Tarabalka, Guillaume Charpiat, and Pierre Alliez. *Can semantic labeling methods generalize to any city? The Inria aerial image labeling benchmark*. In IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS), 2017.

- For the **Private dataset**: Since this dataset is proprietary and does not have a formal citation in the references, I will note that it is a private dataset provided by a collaborating company, and thus it may not have a publicly accessible citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
