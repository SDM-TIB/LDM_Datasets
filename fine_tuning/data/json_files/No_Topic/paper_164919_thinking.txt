To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards End-to-End Lane Detection: an Instance Segmentation Approach" by Davy Neven et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors verify their method on the **tuSimple dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors explicitly mention the **tuSimple lane dataset** in the **results** section, where they describe its composition and the number of training and testing images. This confirms that the tuSimple dataset is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed information about the **tuSimple dataset**. The paper states that it consists of 3626 training images and 2782 testing images, which are recorded under various conditions. The annotations are provided in a JSON format, indicating the x-positions of the lanes at discretized y-positions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **tuSimple dataset**. The paper cites it as follows:
> The tuSimple lane challenge, http://benchmark.tusimple.ai/

Since this is a web resource, I will note that the citation format may differ from traditional academic citations, but it is still important to include the URL for proper attribution.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **tuSimple dataset**. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

In summary, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
