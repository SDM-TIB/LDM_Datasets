To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Grained Entity Typing with High-Multiplicity Assignments" by Maxim Rabinovich and Dan Klein, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new Wikipedia-based fine-grained typing corpus, which suggests that this corpus is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Corpus)**, where the authors describe their methodology for constructing the dataset. They mention that their corpus is based on mentions and categories drawn from Wikipedia, and they detail the process of mention identification, type system construction, and type assignment. This section is crucial as it provides insights into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In this section, the authors explicitly state that they constructed a corpus of entity mentions paired with higher-multiplicity type assignments. They also mention that this corpus will be released, which is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors refer to their dataset as a "Wikipedia-based fine-grained typing corpus" but do not provide a specific name. However, they do mention that the corpus will be released at a specific URL, which can be useful for citation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or any foundational works that may have influenced its creation. The authors reference several papers, but none specifically cite a dataset name. However, they do mention prior works that used Freebase and other resources, which could provide context for the dataset's development.

Since the authors have indicated that their corpus will be publicly available, I will note the URL provided for accessing the dataset. This will be essential for the citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Wikipedia-based Fine-Grained Typing Corpus
- **Description**: A corpus of entity mentions paired with higher-multiplicity type assignments, constructed from Wikipedia categories and mentions.
- **Citation**: Rabinovich, M., & Klein, D. (2023). Fine-Grained Entity Typing with High-Multiplicity Assignments. Retrieved from http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/Ëœrabinovich/

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
