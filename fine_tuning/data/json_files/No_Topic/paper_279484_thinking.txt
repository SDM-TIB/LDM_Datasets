To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Locally Optimal Detection of Stochastic Targeted Universal Adversarial Perturbations" by Amish Goel and Pierre Moulin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method's performance on several popular image classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they mention three key datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 images of size 32x32, divided into 10 classes. The paper states that it is typically split into 50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset also contains 60,000 images of size 32x32 but is divided into 100 classes, with the same training/testing split.

3. **ImageNet (ILSVRC 2012)**: This dataset includes a validation set of 50,000 variable-sized images, which are resized to 224x224 for classification. The authors use 40,000 images for training and 10,000 for evaluation.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **results section**, where the authors discuss the classification accuracy of various detectors on these datasets. This confirms that the datasets mentioned are indeed the ones used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. "Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database." In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
