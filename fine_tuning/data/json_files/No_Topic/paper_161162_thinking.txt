To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autotune: A Derivative-free Optimization Framework for Hyperparameter Tuning" by Patrick Koch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the paper discusses an automated framework for hyperparameter tuning, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** more closely, particularly the subsection where the authors describe their benchmark experiments. Here, they mention using five familiar benchmark datasets taken from mldata.org: **banana, breast cancer, diabetes, image, and thyroid**. This is a crucial finding as it indicates the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the paper. The authors provide some context about the datasets in the experiments section, but I need to ensure I capture the full citations for each dataset as well.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the sources for the datasets as follows:

1. **Banana Dataset**: The dataset is referenced from mldata.org, but no specific citation is provided in the references. I will note that it is available from the mldata repository.

2. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Cortez, P., Cerdeira, A., Almeida, F., Matos, T., & Reis, J. (2009). Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. *Decision Support Systems*, 47(4), 547-553.

3. **Diabetes Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced from mldata.org, similar to the banana dataset, and does not have a specific citation.

4. **Image Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, but it is mentioned as part of their benchmark experiments.

5. **Thyroid Dataset**: Like the previous datasets, this one is referenced from mldata.org without a specific citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets that have them and noting the sources for those that do not.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
