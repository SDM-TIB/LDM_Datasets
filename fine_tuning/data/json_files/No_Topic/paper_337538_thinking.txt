To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning-based approach to reveal tumor mutational burden status from whole slide images across multiple cancer types" by Siteng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "multiple cancer TMB prediction model (MC-TMB)" and indicates that the model was developed using whole slide images (WSIs) from various cancer types, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe the patient cohorts and datasets used for their study. Here, they mention that the MC-TMB model was developed on an internal dataset consisting of **3228 gigapixel WSIs from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort**. This is a significant dataset for the study.

Additionally, the authors state that the model was tested on an **independent dataset from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohort**, which includes **531 WSIs from 5 tumor types**. This indicates another dataset that is crucial for validating the model's performance.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, the citation is:
   > Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Genetics, 2013.

2. For the **Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)**, the citation is:
   > Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. *The Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium: A New Era of Cancer Research*. Cancer Research, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
