To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum-inspired classical algorithms for principal component analysis and supervised clustering" by Ewin Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of the algorithms being discussed, such as those related to principal component analysis and supervised clustering. If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for the original citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
