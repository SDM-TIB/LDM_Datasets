To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Abiotic Stress Prediction from RGB-T Images of Banana Plantlets" by Sagi Levanon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a dataset acquired during an experiment with banana plantlets subjected to various treatments, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment outline and data acquisition section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including the types of images collected (RGB and thermal) and the conditions under which they were taken. They mention that the dataset consists of images taken daily over a period of 17 days from 30 plants, which is crucial information for dataset description.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using this dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research. However, they do not provide a separate section for dataset citations, so I will need to derive the citations from the references section.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **RGB-T Dataset**: This dataset includes RGB and thermal images of banana plantlets taken under four different water and fertilizer treatments. The dataset consists of images from 30 plants, photographed daily for 17 days, with manual annotations of plant contours.

Next, I will look for full citations in the **References section**. The authors reference various sources related to the technology and methods used, but they do not provide a specific citation for their dataset. Since this dataset is original to their research, I will note that it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring to include the details about the dataset's composition and the context of its use in the research. I will also note that the dataset is unique to this study and does not have an external citation.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry with all the relevant details, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or use.
