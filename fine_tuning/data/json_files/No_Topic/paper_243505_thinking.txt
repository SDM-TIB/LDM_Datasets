To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation in Highly Imbalanced and Overlapping Datasets" by Ran Ilan Ber and Tom Haramaty, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their method on datasets generated from electronic health records (EHRs), which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they mention that the data source is based on EHR data from Maccabi HMO (Israel), which encompasses visits of adults aged 18 years and older to their family physician. This indicates that the dataset is derived from real-world medical records.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors specify that they considered 8 respiratory conditions for their experiments. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name for these conditions but rather describe the conditions themselves. The conditions listed are:
1. Strep (Streptococcal) Pharyngitis
2. Upper Respiratory Infection
3. Viral Pharyngitis
4. Allergic Rhinitis
5. Acute Sinusitis
6. Asthma
7. Influenza & Pneumonia

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation for the EHR data or the specific conditions, I will note that the dataset is based on EHR data from Maccabi HMO, but I will need to reference the original source of the EHR data if available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The references do not provide a specific citation for the EHR dataset itself, but they do reference several works related to quantification and domain adaptation, which may be relevant for understanding the context of the datasets used.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset from Maccabi HMO**: This dataset is derived from electronic health records encompassing visits of adults aged 18 years and older to their family physician. However, no specific citation is provided in the paper.

2. **Respiratory Conditions**: The authors mention 8 respiratory conditions used in their experiments, but again, no formal dataset citation is provided.

In conclusion, I will compile the information I have extracted, noting the lack of formal citations for the datasets while acknowledging the source of the EHR data. This will ensure that I have a clear record of the datasets referenced in the paper, even if they are not formally cited.
