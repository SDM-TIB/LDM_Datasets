To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Let-Mi: An Arabic Levantine Twitter Dataset for Misogynistic Language" by Hala Mulki and Bilal Ghanem, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of the **LeT-Mi dataset**, which is a clear indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors describe the dataset as the first benchmark for Arabic misogyny, consisting of 6,550 tweets annotated for various categories of misogynistic language. This section confirms the significance of the dataset and provides context for its creation.

I will then look into the **dataset description section (Section 3)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the **LeT-Mi dataset**. Here, they explain the data collection process, the annotation guidelines, and the final composition of the dataset. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including its size, the categories of misogyny it covers, and the methodology used for annotation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **LeT-Mi dataset** for various classification tasks, which further emphasizes its role in the research. This section may also provide insights into how the dataset was utilized in experiments, but the dataset itself is already well-defined in the previous sections.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **LeT-Mi dataset**. Since this dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation outside of the paper itself. Therefore, I will cite the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the **LeT-Mi dataset** is:
> Hala Mulki and Bilal Ghanem. *Let-Mi: An Arabic Levantine Twitter Dataset for Misogynistic Language*. In Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Abusive Language Online, pages 111â€“118, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **LeT-Mi** and ensure that it includes the necessary details such as the dataset name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information about the dataset from the paper.
