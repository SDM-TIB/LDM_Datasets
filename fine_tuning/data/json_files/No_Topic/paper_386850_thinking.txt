To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting the Quality of Revisions in Argumentative Writing" by Zhexiong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two corpora: **annotated elementary essays** and **existing college essays benchmark**. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Corpora)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention:

1. **College Essay Corpus**: This dataset consists of 60 essays written by college students in response to a prompt about Technology Proliferation. The essays include original drafts and revised drafts based on feedback. 

2. **Elementary Essays Dataset**: This dataset includes 596 essays written by grade 5 to 6 students in response to two different prompts (the United Nation’s Millennium Villages Project and Space Exploration). The essays were revised based on feedback from an Automated Writing Evaluation system.

In the **annotations section**, the authors provide further details about how the datasets were annotated, but I need to focus on the datasets themselves.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **College Essay Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Tazin Afrin and Diane Litman. *Predicting desirable revisions of evidence and reasoning in argumentative writing*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EACL 2023, pages 2550–2561, Dubrovnik, Croatia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Elementary Essays Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Correnti, Lindsay Clare Matsumura, Laura Hamilton, and Elaine Wang. *Assessing students’ skills at writing analytically in response to texts*. The Elementary School Journal, 114(2):142–177, 2013.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
