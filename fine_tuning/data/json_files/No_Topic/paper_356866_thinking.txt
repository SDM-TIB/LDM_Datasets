To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subsampling for Knowledge Graph Embedding Explained" by Hidetaka Kamigaito and Katsuhiko Hayashi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **FB15k-237**, **WN18RR**, and **YAGO3-10** for their experiments. I will note these datasets as they are explicitly stated.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. For **FB15k-237**, the citation is:
   > Kristina Toutanova and Danqi Chen. *Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference*. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality, pages 57–66, Beijing, China, July 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/W15-4007. URL https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-4007.

2. For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
   > Tim Dettmers, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, and Sebastian Riedel. *Convolutional 2d knowledge graph embeddings*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (AAAI-18), pages 1811–1818, 2018. URL https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/17366.

3. For **YAGO3-10**, the citation is:
   > Zhiqing Sun, Zhi-Hong Deng, Jian-Yun Nie, and Jian Tang. *Rotate: Knowledge graph embedding by relational rotation in complex space*. In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019, 2019. URL https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgEQnRqYQ.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all necessary details are captured and properly attributed.
