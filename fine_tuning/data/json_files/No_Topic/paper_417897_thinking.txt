To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge-Assisted Dual-Stage Evolutionary Optimization of Large-Scale Crude Oil Scheduling" by Wanting Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets used for their experiments. If they reference any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then focus on the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that describe the experimental setup or data collection processes. This section may contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Following that, I will look into the **results and discussion** sections, where the authors typically analyze their findings. They may refer to specific datasets when discussing the performance of their proposed methods or comparing results with existing benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset called "Crude Oil Scheduling Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will also note the URL or DOI if provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is accurately documented for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
