To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Foundation Models Learned from Anatomy in Medical Imaging via Self-Supervision" by Mohammad Reza Hosseinzadeh Taher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a self-supervised learning strategy and mentions experiments, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look at the **methodology section** (Section 2) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the proposed self-supervised learning strategy. This section may provide insights into how the datasets are utilized in the experiments.

Then, I will focus on the **experiments and results section** (Section 3), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in Section 3, specifically in the **subsection titled "Datasets and downstream tasks."** The following datasets are identified:

1. **ChestX-ray14**: This dataset includes 112,000 chest radiographs from 30,000 unique patients, with 14 thoracic disease labels. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wang, X., Zhang, R., Shen, C., Kong, T., Li, L. "ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2097–2106, 2017.

2. **NIH Shenzhen CXR**: This dataset consists of 662 frontal-view chest radiographs, with a focus on tuberculosis detection. The citation is:

3. **VinDR-CXR**: This dataset contains 18,000 chest radiographs annotated for five common thoracic diseases. The citation is:
   > Nguyen, H.Q., Lam, K., Le, L.T., et al. "VinDR-CXR: An open dataset of chest x-rays with radiologist’s annotations." Scientific Data, 9, 429, 2020.

4. **SIIM-ACR**: This dataset provides 10,000 chest radiographs for pneumothorax segmentation. The citation is:
   > Siim-acr pneumothorax segmentation. (2019). Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/

5. **ChestX-Det**: This dataset consists of 3,578 images from the ChestX-ray14 dataset, annotated for 13 thoracic diseases. The citation is:
   > Lian, J., Liu, J., Zhang, S., Gao, K., Liu, X., Zhang, D., Yu, Y. "A structure-aware relation network for thoracic diseases detection and segmentation." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 40(8), 2042–2052, 2021.

6. **SCR**: This dataset includes 247 chest radiographs with segmentation masks for the heart and clavicles. The citation is:
   > van Ginneken, B., Stegmann, M., Loog, M. "Segmentation of anatomical structures in chest radiographs using supervised methods: a comparative study on a public database." Medical Image Analysis, 10(1), 19–40, 2006.

7. **VinDR-Rib**: This dataset contains 245 chest radiographs with segmentation annotations for individual ribs. The citation is:
   > Nguyen, H.C., Le, T.T., Pham, H.H., Nguyen, H.Q. "VinDR-RibCXr: A benchmark dataset for automatic segmentation and labeling of individual ribs on chest x-rays." In Medical Imaging with Deep Learning, 2021.

8. **EyePACS**: This dataset consists of 88,702 color fundus images for diabetic retinopathy screening. The citation is:
   > Cuadros, J., Bresnick, G. "EyePACS: An adaptable telemedicine system for diabetic retinopathy screening." Diabetes Science and Technology, 3(3), 509–516, 2009.

9. **DRIVE**: This dataset includes 40 color fundus images with annotations for retinal vessel segmentation. The citation is:
   > Staal, J., Abramoff, M.D., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M.A., and van Ginneken, B. "Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 23(4), 501–509, 2004.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
