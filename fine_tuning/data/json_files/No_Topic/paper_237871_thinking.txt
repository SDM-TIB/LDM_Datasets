To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlignSeg: Feature-Aligned Segmentation Networks" by Zilong Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on **Cityscapes** and **ADE20K**, which suggests that these datasets are important for their research.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset is described as containing 5,000 images with high-quality pixel-level annotations and 20,000 images with coarse annotations. Each image has a resolution of 1024×2048 pixels and belongs to one of 19 classes. The authors specify that they used the 5,000 images with high-quality annotations for their experiments.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is noted for its dense labeling of images into 150 stuff/object classes. The authors mention that it is divided into 20,000 images for training, 2,000 for validation, and 3,000 for testing.

Additionally, they reference the **COCO** dataset, which is used for instance segmentation and contains 115,000 images across 80 categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641, 2017.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
