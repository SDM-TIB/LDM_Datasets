To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Action Recognition with Deep Temporal Pyramids" by Ahmed Mazari and Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using the **UCF101 database**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to gather more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method using the **UCF101 database**. I will note down the specifics provided about this dataset, including its characteristics and the number of video shots and categories.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the UCF101 dataset as follows: it includes **13,320 video shots** taken from various actions belonging to **101 categories**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the UCF101 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **UCF101 Dataset**:
  > K. Soomro, A.-R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild*. CRCV-TR-12-01, 2012.

Since the paper primarily discusses the UCF101 dataset, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and accurate representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
