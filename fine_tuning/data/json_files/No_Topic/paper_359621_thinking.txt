To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CS-MLGCN: Multiplex Graph Convolutional Networks for Community Search in Multiplex Networks" by Ali Behrouz and Farnoosh Hashemi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of vertices, edges, and views.

In the provided text, I notice a **Table 1** that summarizes the characteristics of several datasets. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **AUCS**: A dataset with 61 vertices, 620 edges, and 5 views.
2. **Terrorist**: A dataset with 79 vertices, 2.2K edges, and 14 views.
3. **RM**: A dataset with 91 vertices, 14K edges, and 10 views.
4. **DKPol**: A dataset with 490 vertices, 20K edges, and 3 views.
5. **Brain**: A dataset with 190 vertices, 570K edges, and 20 views.
6. **DBLP**: A dataset with 513K vertices, 1M edges, and 10 views.
7. **Amazon**: A dataset with 410K vertices, 8.1M edges, and 4 views.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The authors often cite the original sources of the datasets they used, which is crucial for proper attribution.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the datasets are linked to various studies. For example, the **Brain dataset** is mentioned in the context of functional systems of the human brain, which may lead me to a specific citation related to brain networks.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets along with their full citations. The citations will be formatted according to the conventions used in the paper, ensuring that I provide accurate and complete references.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
