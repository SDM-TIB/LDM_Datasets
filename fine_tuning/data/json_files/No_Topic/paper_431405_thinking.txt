To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization" by Fei Xue, Ignas Budvytis, and Roberto Cipolla, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **7Scenes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7 indoor scenes, each with a specific number of landmarks and keypoints. The authors report recognition precision and other metrics for this dataset.

2. **12Scenes Dataset**: Similar to the 7Scenes dataset, this dataset contains 12 indoor scenes and is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

3. **CambridgeLandmarks Dataset**: This dataset includes 5 outdoor scenes located in Cambridge, which are used to assess the localization capabilities of the proposed model.

4. **Aachen Dataset**: This dataset is more challenging, containing images captured in various seasons and lighting conditions, making it suitable for testing the robustness of the proposed method.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **7Scenes Dataset**: 
  > Shotton, J., Glocker, B., Izadi, S., & Criminisi, A. (2013). Real-time RGB-D camera relocalization. In *ISMAR* (pp. 173-179).

- **12Scenes Dataset**: 
  > Valentin, J., Dai, A., NieÃŸner, M., Kohli, P., Torr, P., Izadi, S., & Keskin, C. (2016). Learning to navigate the energy landscape. In *3DV*.

- **CambridgeLandmarks Dataset**: 
  > Kendall, A., Grimes, M., & Cipolla, R. (2015). PoseNet: A convolutional network for real-time 6-DoF camera relocalization. In *ICCV*.

- **Aachen Dataset**: 
  > Sattler, T., Weyand, T., Leibe, B., & Kobbelt, L. (2012). Image retrieval for image-based localization revisited. In *BMVC*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
