To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Stationary Markov Processes with Contrastive Adjustment" by Ludvig BergenstrÃ¥hle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on various image synthesis tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their method on three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CelebA-HQ**, and **LSUN Church**. I will note these datasets and look for detailed descriptions or references to their sources.

I will then check the **figures** and **tables** for any additional context or information about the datasets used. For instance, the figures show samples generated from these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to extract are:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." (2009).

2. **CelebA-HQ**:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. "A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks." In: Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

3. **LSUN Church**:
   > Fisher Yu, et al. "LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning With Humans in the Loop." ArXiv preprint abs/1506.03365 (2015).

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
