To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced capital-asset pricing model for the reconstruction of bipartite financial networks" by Tiziano Squartini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors tested their method on a dataset collected by the European Central Bank, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** of the paper, which is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this case, the authors mention the **Security Holding Statistics (SHS)** dataset collected by the European Central Bank. They provide specific details about the dataset, including the time span (2009Q1 to 2015Q2), the types of financial tools included (long-term security bonds, short-term security bonds, money market funds, and equity), and the structure of the data (quarterly information at the country-sector level).

I will also check the **methodology** and **results sections** to confirm that the dataset is indeed used for the analysis and to gather any additional context or details that may be relevant for describing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the necessary information for the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Security Holding Statistics (SHS)
   - **Description**: The dataset contains quarterly information on individual securities at the country-sector level, covering a time span from 2009Q1 to 2015Q2. It includes data on long-term security bonds, short-term security bonds, money market funds, and equity, reported at the current euro value.
   - **Citation**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the SHS dataset in the references, but it is implied to be collected by the European Central Bank. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:
     > European Central Bank. *Security Holding Statistics (SHS)*. Data collected from 2009Q1 to 2015Q2.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow me to present the dataset in a structured manner, ready for any further processing or review.
