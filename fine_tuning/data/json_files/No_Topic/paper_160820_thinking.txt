To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Embeddings Approach for Detecting Mobile Counterfeit Apps" by Jathushan Rajasegaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions analyzing approximately **1.2 million apps from the Google Play Store**, which indicates a large dataset is involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and the dataset section.

In **section 3 (Dataset)**, the authors describe how they collected their dataset by crawling the Google Play Store. They mention discovering and collecting information from **1,250,808 apps** and successfully downloading APKs for **1,024,511 apps**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also mention a **labelled set** of **3,910 apps** that were manually inspected for visual similarity, which is crucial for their evaluation of the image similarity metrics. This labelled set is derived from a heuristic approach based on app developers and download counts.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from the Google Play Store. However, I can note the methodology used to create the dataset.

The key datasets I will extract from the paper are:

1. **Google Play Store Dataset**: This dataset includes metadata and app icons for **1,250,808 apps** collected through a web crawler.
   - Citation: Not applicable as it is a dataset derived from the Google Play Store.

2. **Labelled Set of Visually Similar Apps**: This dataset consists of **3,910 apps** that were manually inspected for visual similarity.
   - Citation: Not applicable as it is a derived dataset from the Google Play Store.

3. **Top-1,000 Apps Dataset**: This dataset includes the top-1,000 apps sorted by downloads, reviews, and ratings, used to identify potential counterfeits.
   - Citation: Not applicable as it is a derived dataset from the Google Play Store.

After identifying these datasets, I will summarize their details and ensure that I have noted the methodology used to create them, even if formal citations are not provided. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
