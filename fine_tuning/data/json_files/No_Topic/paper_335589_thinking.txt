To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Motion Segmentation" by Federica Arrigoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "new real dataset (Q-MSEG)" specifically created for motion segmentation, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They mention that they evaluated their approach on the **Q-MSEG dataset**, which they generated for motion segmentation with ground-truth annotations. This dataset comprises six images depicting three planar objects captured from diverse viewpoints, and it is crucial to note the details provided about the dataset.

In the **supplementary material**, the authors provide additional statistics about the Q-MSEG dataset, including the number of images, points, and configurations used for the experiments. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Now, I will compile the necessary details about the Q-MSEG dataset:

1. **Q-MSEG Dataset**: This dataset is specifically created for motion segmentation tasks and includes six images with annotations for three planar objects. Each object is annotated with keypoints selected from highly textured locations.

Next, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. The paper does not provide a separate reference for the Q-MSEG dataset, but since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, I will cite it as follows:

- For **Q-MSEG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federica Arrigoni, Willi Menapace, Marcel Seelbach Benkner, Elisa Ricci, and Vladislav Golyanik. *Quantum Motion Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured correctly and includes the full citation, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future works.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
