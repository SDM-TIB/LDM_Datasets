To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning for Monolingual End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition" by Steven Vander Eeckt and Hugo Van Hamme, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of Continual Learning (CL) methods for End-to-End ASR across four new tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention the **Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (CGN)** dataset. This dataset is described as containing 900 hours of Dutch speech from both the Netherlands and Belgium, split into four tasks based on dialect. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CGN dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Nelleke Oostdijk, “The spoken dutch corpus: Overview and first evaluation,” Proceedings of LREC-2000, Athens, vol. 2, 01 2000.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will create an entry for the CGN dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. 

After completing this, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for review or further processing.
