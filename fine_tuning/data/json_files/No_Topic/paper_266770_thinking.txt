To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness of Mathematical Models and Technical Analysis Strategies" by Ahmed Bel Hadj Ayed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions numerical examples and empirical tests based on real data, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and simulations sections**. In these sections, the authors describe their methodology and the data used for their simulations and empirical tests. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to several datasets used in their empirical tests:

1. **Nine Stock Indexes**: The paper mentions the use of nine stock indexes, including the S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, Nasdaq Index, Euro Stoxx 50 Index, CAC 40 Index, DAX Index, Nikkei 225 Index, FTSE 100 Index, and ASX 200 Index.

2. **Nine Forex Exchange Rates**: The authors also refer to nine forex exchange rates, including EUR/CNY, EUR/USD, EUR/JPY, EUR/GBP, EUR/CHF, EUR/MYR, EUR/BRL, EUR/AUD, and EUR/ZAR.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies that are referenced. However, since the datasets mentioned are common financial indices and forex rates, they may not have specific citations. Instead, I will note that these datasets are widely recognized and publicly available.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets and their descriptions. The full citations for the datasets may not be necessary since they are standard financial datasets, but I will acknowledge their common sources.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that they are clear and concise, ready for any downstream processing or analysis.
