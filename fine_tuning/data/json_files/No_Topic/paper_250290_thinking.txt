To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vehicle Trajectory Prediction by Transfer Learning of Semi-Supervised Models" by Nick Lamm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors show improvements in vehicle trajectory prediction using semi-supervised models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in their experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of trajectory prediction and mention using state-of-the-art methods, which may indicate the use of specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **Datasets subsection**. Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: The authors describe it as a public large-scale dataset consisting of 1000 driving scenes in Boston and Singapore, with specific details about the data partitions and the nature of the data collected.

2. **Drive360 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 55 hours of driving data recorded in Switzerland, with details about how the data is partitioned for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A.H., Vora, S., Liong, V.E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., Beijbom, O. (2020). *nuScenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11621–11631.

- For the **Drive360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hecker, S., Dai, D., Van Gool, L. (2018). *End to end learning of driving models with surround-view cameras and route planners*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 435–453.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for further processing or review.
