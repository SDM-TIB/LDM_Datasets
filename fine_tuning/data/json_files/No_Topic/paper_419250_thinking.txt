To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Value Generation with Prompt Learning and Self-Training for Low-Resource Dialogue State Tracking" by Ming Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset**, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experimentation section** (section 3) where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention that their experiments are conducted on the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset**. They describe it as a multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset containing 8438 dialogues for training, 1000 for validation, and 1000 for testing. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mihail Eric, Rahul Goel, Shachi Paul, Abhishek Sethi, Sanchit Agarwal, Shuyang Gao, Adarsh Kumar, Anuj Kumar Goyal, Peter Ku, and Dilek Hakkani-Tür. *Multiwoz 2.1: A consolidated multi-domain dialogue dataset with state corrections and state tracking baselines*. In Proceedings of The 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, LREC 2020, Marseille, France, May 11-16, 2020, pages 422–428. European Language Resources Association, 2020. URL https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.53/.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1 Dataset**: A multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset with 8438 dialogues for training, 1000 for validation, and 1000 for testing.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
