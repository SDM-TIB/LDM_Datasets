To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A large calcium-imaging dataset reveals a systematic V4 organization for natural scenes" by Tianye Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any references to datasets or data collection methods.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for large datasets in visual neuroscience, which suggests that they may have created or used specific datasets for their research. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe their widefield calcium imaging setup and the specific natural image stimuli used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset consists of responses to over 17,000 unique color natural images sourced from **ImageNet** (Deng et al., 2009). This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the dataset again when discussing their findings, so I will take note of any additional details or context provided about the dataset.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset, as well as any other datasets mentioned in the paper.

The full citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., and Li, F.F. (2009). ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database. Proc Cvpr Ieee, 248-255.

Additionally, I will note that the authors collected data from three monkeys (A, B, and C), which may be relevant for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
