To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Low Rank Phase Retrieval" by Seyedehsara Nayer, Praneeth Narayanamurthy, and Namrata Vaswani, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study. For instance, if the authors refer to any datasets for experiments or evaluations, I will note them down.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that describe the experimental setup and the data used for testing the proposed algorithms.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract detailed information about each dataset mentioned. This includes:
   - The name of the dataset.
   - A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics (e.g., whether it is a video dataset, image dataset, etc.).
   - Any specific metrics or features that are highlighted in relation to the dataset.

4. **Check for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will look for citations in the text that reference the original sources of these datasets. This is crucial for providing proper attribution. I will check the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset.

5. **Compile Full Citations**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the full citation as it appears in the references section. This will include the authors, title, publication venue, year, and any other relevant details.

6. **Summarize Findings**: Finally, I will summarize my findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is listed with its description and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
