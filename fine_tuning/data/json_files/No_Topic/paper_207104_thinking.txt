To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Numerical Sparsity for Efficient Learning: Faster Eigenvector Computation and Regression" by Neha Gupta and Aaron Sidford, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experiments conducted, as they usually detail the datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a dataset for their experiments but do not explicitly name it in the abstract or introduction. I will then check the **"Experiments" section** for any mentions of datasets. Here, I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that provide details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **"MNIST dataset"** for experiments, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper also mentions another dataset, such as the **"CIFAR-10 dataset,"** I will find its citation as well:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 Dataset*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
