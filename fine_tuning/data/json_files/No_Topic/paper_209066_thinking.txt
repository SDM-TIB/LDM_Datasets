To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Prediction of Phenotypic Drug Response on Cancer Cell Lines Using Deep Convolutional Network" by Pengfei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** database, indicating that it is a primary dataset used in the research. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of public phenotypic screening datasets. They specifically mention the **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)** and the **GDSC** as the most popular datasets in the field. This confirms that both datasets are relevant to the study.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 3.1 (Data Acquisition and Preprocessing)**, the authors provide detailed information about the GDSC dataset. They describe the three files downloaded from GDSC:

1. **Drug list.csv**: Contains a list of 265 drugs.
2. **PANCANCER Genetic feature.csv**: Lists 990 cancer cell lines with up to 735 features.
3. **PANCANCER IC.csv**: Contains IC50 information for 250 drugs and 1074 cell lines.

The authors also mention that they used version 6.0 of the GDSC dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the GDSC dataset, further confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The GDSC dataset is cited as follows:

- **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)**:
  > Garnett, M. J., Edelman, E. J., Heidorn, S. J., Greenman, C. D., Dastur, A., Lau, K. W., Greninger, P., Thompson, I. R., Luo, X., Soares, J., et al. (2012). Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells. *Nature*, 483(7391), 570â€“575.

- **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)**:
  > Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Consortium, Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Consortium, et al. (2015). Pharmacogenomic agreement between two cancer cell line data sets. *Nature*, 528(7580), 84.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)**: A comprehensive dataset used for drug sensitivity analysis in cancer cell lines.
2. **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)**: Another important dataset for understanding drug responses in various cancer cell lines.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
