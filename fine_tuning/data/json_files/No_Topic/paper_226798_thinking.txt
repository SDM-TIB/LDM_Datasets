To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Sketch & Fill: Multiclass Sketch-to-Image Translation" by Arnab Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a new image dataset of ten simple object classes, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention using the **edges2shoes** and **CelebA-HQ** datasets for single-class generation tasks. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

In addition, the authors introduce a new dataset consisting of 200 images for ten classes (basketball, chicken, cookie, cupcake, moon, orange, soccer, strawberry, watermelon, and pineapple). They specify that this dataset has 150 training images and 50 testing images for each class, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **edges2shoes** dataset, the citation is:
   > P. Isola, J.-Y. Zhu, T. Zhou, and A. Efros. *Image-to-image translation with conditional adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

2. For the **CelebA-HQ** dataset, the citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. ICLR, 2018.

3. The new dataset created by the authors does not have a formal citation since it is introduced in this paper. However, I will document it as follows:
   > Ghosh, A., Zhang, R., Dokania, P. K., Wang, O., Efros, A. A., Torr, P. H. S., & Shechtman, E. *Interactive Sketch & Fill: Multiclass Sketch-to-Image Translation*. (2023). This dataset consists of 200 images for ten classes with 150 training and 50 testing images.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
