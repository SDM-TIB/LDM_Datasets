To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChildPredictor: A Child Face Prediction Framework with Disentangled Learning" by Yuzhi Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the collection of a **Family Face Database (FF-Database)**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Data Collection of FF-Database)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the FF-Database. They describe it as a large-scale dataset consisting of **16,046 images**, including **7,148 parent faces** and **8,190 child faces**, with specific attributes labeled. This section is crucial as it provides both the dataset's purpose and its structure.

In addition to the FF-Database, the authors mention using **FFHQ child faces** from the **FFHQ dataset** to enhance the generation quality of their model. This dataset is also important to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Family Face Database (FF-Database)**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is newly collected. However, I will note that it is a significant contribution of the authors.

2. **FFHQ Dataset**: The citation for the FFHQ dataset is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Family Face Database (FF-Database)**: A newly collected dataset consisting of 16,046 images with labeled attributes, specifically designed for child face prediction tasks.

- **FFHQ Dataset**: A dataset used to enhance the generation quality of the ChildPredictor framework, consisting of high-quality child faces.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
