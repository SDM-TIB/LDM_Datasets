To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Heuristic Approach to Two Level Boolean Minimization Derived from Karnaugh Mapping" by Ethan L. Childerhose and Jingzhou Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on a heuristic method for simplifying Boolean expressions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. The introduction discusses the limitations of existing methods like the Karnaugh map and Quine-McCluskey but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any mention of data sources or datasets used for testing the proposed heuristic method. The paper mentions using expansion methods in BOOM to generate prime implicants, but it does not provide specific datasets.

In the **experiments or results section**, I will check for any datasets that were utilized to validate the proposed method. However, the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts and does not provide empirical results based on specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references include foundational papers on Boolean function minimization, but they do not point to specific datasets used in this research.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. Therefore, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.

Since no datasets were identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper.
