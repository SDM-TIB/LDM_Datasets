To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Modeling Dynamic Human Bodies" by Sida Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on the **H36M** and **ZJU-MoCap** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **H36M Dataset**: This dataset records multi-view videos with 4 cameras and captures human poses using a marker-based motion capture system. It includes multiple subjects performing complex actions, and the authors mention that they selected representative actions and split the videos into training and test frames.

2. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**: This dataset records multi-view videos with 21 cameras and collects human poses using a marker-less motion capture system. The authors specify that they selected four representative sequences for evaluation and used four uniformly distributed cameras for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **H36M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. PAMI, 2013.

- For the **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sida Peng, Yuanqing Zhang, Yinghao Xu, Qianqian Wang, Qing Shuai, Hujun Bao, and Xiaowei Zhou. *Neural body: Implicit neural representations with structured latent codes for novel view synthesis of dynamic humans*. In CVPR, 2021.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
