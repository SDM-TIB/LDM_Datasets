To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Domain Toxic Spans Detection" by Stefan F. Schouten et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on detecting toxic spans in language, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Details)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **SemEval-2021 Task 5**: This dataset is derived from the Civil Comments dataset and is annotated for toxic spans. The authors note that annotators were tasked with extracting toxic word sequences, and they provide details about inter-annotator agreement.

2. **HateXplain**: This dataset consists of posts from Twitter and Gab, annotated not only for message-level toxicity but also for justifying rationales for the toxicity. The authors mention that no inter-annotator agreement is reported for the span annotations.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **SemEval-2021 Task 5**, the citation is:
  > Pavlopoulos, J., Sorensen, J., Laugier, L., & Androutsopoulos, I. (2021). SemEval-2021 task 5: Toxic spans detection. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval), pp. 59–69. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.semeval-1.6

- For **HateXplain**, the citation is:
  > Mathew, B., Saha, P., Yimam, S.M., Biemann, C., Goyal, P., & Mukherjee, A. (2021). HateXplain: A Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Hate Speech Detection. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 35(17), 14867–14875. https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v35i17.17745

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
