To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Creating Scalable and Interactive Web Applications Using High Performance Latent Variable Models" by Aaron Q Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and implementation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the project but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses latent variable models and their applications but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation)**, where the authors describe the components of their system. In this section, they mention using the **SNAP Amazon reviews dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In **subsection 4.1 (Pre-Processing & NLP)**, the authors specify that they are using the **Electronics category from the SNAP Amazon reviews dataset**, which consists of approximately 1 million reviews and 76,000 products. This gives me a good understanding of the dataset's scope and content.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNAP Amazon reviews dataset. The citation provided is:
> Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl, SNAP Large Network Dataset Collection 2014. Available at: http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon-links.html.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **SNAP Amazon reviews dataset**: This dataset includes a large collection of Amazon product reviews, specifically focusing on the Electronics category, which contains approximately 1 million reviews and 76,000 products.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
