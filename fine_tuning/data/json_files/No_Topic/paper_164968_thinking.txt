To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Convolutional Network Ensembles for White Matter Hyperintensities Segmentation in MR Images" by Hongwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their algorithm on a dataset from the WMH Segmentation Challenge, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials)**, which is dedicated to describing the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention the **MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge** dataset, which consists of 170 subjects with FLAIR and T1 MR images from five different scanners. They provide details about the training set (60 subjects) and the hidden test set (110 subjects), which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

In this section, I will note the characteristics of the dataset, including the number of subjects, types of images (FLAIR and T1), and the number of scanners involved. This information is essential for a comprehensive dataset description.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset. The authors acknowledge the organizers of the challenge, which provides a lead for the citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Kuijf, H. J., et al. "MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge." In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), 2017.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and accurately represented.
