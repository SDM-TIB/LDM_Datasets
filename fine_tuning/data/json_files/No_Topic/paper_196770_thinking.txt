To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A necessary and sufficient condition for two relations to induce the same definable set family" by Hua Yao and William Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodologies or experiments. In this paper, there are no explicit mentions of datasets in the abstract or introduction. Therefore, I will look for any references to datasets in the sections that describe the theoretical framework or examples used to illustrate the concepts.

Since the paper primarily discusses theoretical aspects of rough set theory and does not present empirical experiments or datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets or related works that may have utilized datasets. However, based on the content of the paper, it appears that the authors do not provide specific datasets for analysis.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset as follows:

1. If a dataset is mentioned, I will note its name and description.
2. I will then locate the corresponding citation in the References section to ensure I have the complete reference for each dataset.

In this case, it seems that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to report from this paper.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in the paper, and I will ensure to document this in any output or report I prepare.
