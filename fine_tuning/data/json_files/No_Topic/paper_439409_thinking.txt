To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modally Reduced Representation Learning of Multi-Lead ECG Signals" by Nabil Ibtehaz and Masood Mortazavi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used for training or testing the proposed methods. The authors may discuss the significance of certain datasets in the context of their research.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their pretraining dataset. Here, they mention using the **PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 dataset**, which includes 88,000 public ECG recordings compiled from six sources. This is a crucial dataset for understanding their approach.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional datasets used for validation or testing their model. The authors mention using recordings from the **PTB** and **INCART** databases as test datasets. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their experiments.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of specific experiments, such as the **ECG-ID benchmark dataset** used for biometric authentication.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For the **PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Matthew A Reyna, Nadi Sadr, Erick A Perez Alday, Annie Gu, Amit J Shah, Chad Robichaux, Ali Bahrami Rad, Andoni Elola, Salman Seyedi, Sardar Ansari, Hamid Ghanbari, Qiao Li, Ashish Sharma, and Gari D Clifford. *Will Two Do? Varying Dimensions in Electrocardiography: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021*. In 2021 Computing in Cardiology (CinC), pp. 1–4. IEEE, 9 2021. doi: 10.23919/CinC53138.2021.9662687.

2. For the **PTB database**, the citation is:

3. For the **INCART database**, the citation is:
   > Vikto Tihonenko, A Khaustov, S Ivanov, A Rivin, and E Yakushenko. *St Petersburg INCART 12-lead arrhythmia database*. PhysioBank PhysioToolkit and PhysioNet, 2008.

4. For the **ECG-ID benchmark dataset**, the citation is:
   > T S Lugovaya. *Biometric human identification based on electrocardiogram*. Master’s thesis, Faculty of Computing Technologies and Informatics, Electrotechnical University ‘LETI’, Saint-Petersburg, Russian Federation, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
