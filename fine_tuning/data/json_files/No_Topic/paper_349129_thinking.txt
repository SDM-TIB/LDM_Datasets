To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mutual Fund Categorization using Natural Language Processing" by Dimitrios Vamvourellis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data description sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the categorization of mutual funds and mentions using data from Lipper Global Data Feed, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **data description section** (Section 2), where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They specify that they utilized data from the **Lipper Global Data Feed**, which includes all U.S. domiciled open-end mutual funds and ETFs. The authors describe the nature of the data, including the principal investment objectives extracted from SEC filings and the classification system used (Refinitiv Lipper Global categories).

In this section, they also mention that after cleaning the data, they ended up with a total of 12,594 samples across 94 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and structure.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Lipper Global Data Feed. However, it appears that the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific paper but rather to a corporate source (Refinitiv). Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- **Lipper Global Data Feed**: 
  > Refinitiv. "Lipper Fund Research." 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used for the research is the Lipper Global Data Feed.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the citation is included for reference. This will allow for easy access to the dataset information for future use or analysis.
