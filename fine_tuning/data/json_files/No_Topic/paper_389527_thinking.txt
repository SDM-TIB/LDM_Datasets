To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assumption-lean falsification tests of rate double-robustness of double-machine-learning estimators" by Lin Liu, Rajarshi Mukherjee, and James M. Robins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their sources, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. This section is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any references to datasets, particularly if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. This can provide additional context about the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation, which might look like this:
- Penn Action Dataset: Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
