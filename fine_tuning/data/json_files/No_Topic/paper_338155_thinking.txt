To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Position-aware Location Regression Network for Temporal Video Grounding" by Sunoh Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe:

1. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is derived from the Charades dataset and is specifically designed for temporal video grounding. It consists of 6,672 videos and 16,128 video-query pairs, with a detailed breakdown of training and testing pairs.

2. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset is used for dense video captioning and contains 20,000 videos related to 200 activity classes, along with 100,000 queries. The authors provide information about the average length of videos and the number of queries per video.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Charades-STA**, the citation is:
  > Gao, J., Sun, C., Yang, Z., & Nevatia, R. (2017). Tall: Temporal activity localization via language query. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, 2017.

- For **ActivityNet Captions**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Hata, K., Ren, F., Fei-Fei, L., & Niebles, J. C. (2017). Dense-captioning events in videos. In *Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)*, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
