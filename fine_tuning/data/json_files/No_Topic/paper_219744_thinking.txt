To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sionnx: Automatic Unit Test Generator for ONNX Conformance" by Xinli Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the development of Sionnx for ONNX conformance testing but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the challenges of ONNX operators and does not provide dataset information.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used for testing or validation purposes. I will look for any specific datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments or any datasets that are part of the ONNX framework.

In the **experiments section**, if the authors mention using specific datasets for testing the Sionnx framework, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper references well-known datasets, such as those commonly used in machine learning or AI research, I will ensure to include their standard citations. If the datasets are newly introduced or specific to the authors' work, I will document the citation as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
