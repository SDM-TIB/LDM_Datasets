To extract datasets from the research paper titled "THE CCI30 INDEX" by Igor Rivin and Carlo Scevola, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, solution, and performance sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the index's purpose, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction outlines the goals of the index but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **solution section**, particularly sections 2.2 (Number of cryptocurrencies) and 2.3 (Weighting scheme). Here, the authors mention that the index is based on the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This indicates that the dataset consists of these cryptocurrencies, but I need to confirm if they provide a specific list or source for this dataset.

In section 2.2, the authors state that they decided to use the top 30 cryptocurrencies, which implies that there is a dataset that includes these cryptocurrencies. However, the paper does not provide a detailed list or a specific dataset name. Instead, it describes the methodology for selecting and weighting these cryptocurrencies.

In the **performance section**, the authors mention the performance of the CCI30 index but do not provide additional datasets or references to external datasets. They do not cite any specific dataset or provide a link to where the dataset can be accessed.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation or a specific dataset name, I will note that the dataset consists of the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, but I cannot provide a full citation for a dataset as it is not explicitly mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will summarize my findings:
- The dataset is implicitly defined as the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, but no specific dataset name or citation is provided in the paper.

Since there are no formal citations for datasets in this paper, I will conclude that while the authors describe the dataset conceptually, they do not provide a specific dataset reference that can be cited.

In summary, I will document the findings regarding the dataset as follows:
- Dataset: Top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (no formal citation available).

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when available. However, in this case, the lack of explicit dataset references means I cannot provide a citation for the dataset.
