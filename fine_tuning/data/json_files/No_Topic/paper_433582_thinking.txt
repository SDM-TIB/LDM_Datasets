To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advanced simulation-based predictive modeling for solar irradiance sensor farms" by José L. Risco-Martín et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the CAIDE framework for solar irradiance sensor farms, which suggests that there may be datasets related to solar irradiance measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **use case section** (Section 5), where the authors describe a simulation involving two sensor farms: one based on real monitoring data from the Oahu Solar Measurement Grid and the other using synthetic data generated from the PhotoVoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS). This section is likely to contain the specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the use case section, the authors mention:

1. **Oahu Solar Measurement Grid**: This dataset consists of real solar irradiance measurements collected from 17 sensors distributed near Honolulu airport. The paper cites the source of this dataset as:
   > Sengupta, M., & Andreas, A. (2010). *1-Year Archive: Grid 1-Second Solar Irradiance; Oahu, Hawaii*. Measurement and Instrumentation Data Center. Retrieved from https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/apps/sitehome.pl?site=OAHUGRID.

2. **Almeria Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated using the PhotoVoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS). While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the synthetic dataset, it references PVGIS as the source for generating irradiance data. The citation for PVGIS is:
   > European Commission. (2023). *PhotoVoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS)*. Retrieved from https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they are used within the paper. The Oahu dataset is used for real monitoring, while the Almeria dataset serves as a synthetic counterpart for comparison.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited and described, ready for further processing or review.
