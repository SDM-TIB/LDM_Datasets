To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpectralLeader: Online Spectral Learning for Single Topic Models" by Tong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new online learning algorithm and mentions experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 7) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they mention two real-world datasets: **Newspapers data** and **Twitter data**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, size, and how they were used in the experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors provide the following details:

1. **Newspapers Data**: This dataset is collected over multiple years and consists of sequences of documents with timestamps. The authors mention that they retain the 500 most frequent words in the vocabulary and evaluate on 100K documents.

2. **Twitter Data**: This dataset is collected during the 2016 United States elections and also consists of sequences of documents with timestamps. Similar to the Newspapers data, the authors retain the 500 most frequent words in the vocabulary and evaluate on 100K documents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely publicly available datasets, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will note the sources provided in the text:

- For **Newspapers Data**, the authors reference it as:
  > "Newspapers data collected over multiple years. Please see https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news."

- For **Twitter Data**, the authors reference it as:
  > "Twitter data collected during the 2016 United States elections. Please see https://www.kaggle.com/kinguistics/election-day-tweets."

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as noted above.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation for proper attribution.
