To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Noise Segmentation: How Neural Noise Leads to the Emergence of Segmentation and Grouping" by Ben Lonnqvist et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce the **Good Gestalt (GG) datasets**, which is a strong indication that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **Good Gestalt (GG) datasets** in **section 2.3**. Here, they mention that the GG datasets consist of six individual datasets designed to test perceptual grouping.

I will carefully extract the details of each dataset mentioned in this section:

1. **Kanizsa Squares**: This dataset is used to study the perception of illusory figures, where humans can perceive illusory contours when cued by specific shapes.

2. **Closure**: This dataset examines whether a model can combine individual image elements to form a closed object.

3. **Continuity**: This dataset tests the integration of individual elements across the visual field to form a continuous object.

4. **Proximity**: This dataset studies how the distance between elements affects their grouping.

5. **Gradient Occlusion**: This dataset evaluates the ability to handle occlusion of an element without a constant color value.

6. **Illusory Occlusion**: This dataset investigates grouping across the visual field while being occluded by an illusory object.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. The authors reference several foundational works related to the principles of Gestalt psychology and the datasets themselves, but they do not provide specific citations for the GG datasets since they are original contributions of the authors.

Since the GG datasets are original to this paper, I will note that the citation for the datasets will be the paper itself:

- For the **Good Gestalt (GG) datasets**, the citation is:
  > Ben Lonnqvist, Zhengqing Wu, and Michael H. Herzog. *Latent Noise Segmentation: How Neural Noise Leads to the Emergence of Segmentation and Grouping*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GG datasets as they are the primary datasets discussed in the paper.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets with their descriptions and citations:
1. **Kanizsa Squares** - Study of illusory figures.
2. **Closure** - Combining elements to form closed objects.
3. **Continuity** - Integration of elements across the visual field.
4. **Proximity** - Grouping based on distance.
5. **Gradient Occlusion** - Handling occlusion without constant color.
6. **Illusory Occlusion** - Grouping while occluded by illusory objects.

Finally, I will ensure that the citation for the datasets is properly formatted and included in the output.
