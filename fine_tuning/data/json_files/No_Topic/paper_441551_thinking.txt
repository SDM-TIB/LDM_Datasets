To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When is an Embedder More Promising than Another?" by Maxime Darrin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of embedding models and hints at the use of various datasets for this purpose.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention the diversity of datasets used for evaluating embedding models. This section may provide insights into specific datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes and characteristics. For instance, they mention using datasets like **ZINC 250k** for molecular modeling tasks, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors reference any additional datasets or provide performance metrics related to specific datasets. This can help confirm the datasets used and their relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions the **ZINC 250k dataset**, I will look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Irwin, J. J., & Shoichet, B. K. (2005). ZINC: A Free Database of Commercially Available Compounds for Virtual Screening. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 45(1), 177-182.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
