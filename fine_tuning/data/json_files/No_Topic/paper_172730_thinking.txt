To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple-Kernel Local-Patch Descriptor" by Arun Mukundan, Giorgos Tolias, and OndÅ™ej Chum, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two local patch benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Phototourism Dataset**: This dataset contains three sets of patches (Liberty, Notredame, and Yosemite) and is widely used for training and evaluating local descriptors. The authors mention that it provides supervision through labels indicating the corresponding 3D points for the patches.

2. **HPatches Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing local patches of higher diversity and is used for three tasks: verification, retrieval, and matching. The authors follow a standard evaluation protocol for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Phototourism Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Simon Winder and Matthew Brown. *Learning local image descriptors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2007.

- For the **HPatches Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vassileios Balntas, Karel Lenc, Andrea Vedaldi, and Krystian Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the details as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
