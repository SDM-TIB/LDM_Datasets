To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic contrast enhancement in cardiac CT with Deep Learning" by Gianmarco Santini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a deep learning approach using a set of 120 patients, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of 150 ECG-triggered CT scans acquired during standard cardiac CT sessions. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of scans, the imaging parameters, and the manual segmentation provided by expert radiologists.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **150 ECG-triggered CT scans**: This is the primary dataset used for training and evaluation.
- The scans are characterized by specific imaging parameters, such as tube voltage and current, and the images are reconstructed with a fixed slice thickness.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, in this case, the dataset is not attributed to a specific external source but is rather a collection of scans from the authors' own clinical practice.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or cited from another source, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to the authors' institution and does not have a formal citation. However, I will still document the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: ECG-triggered CT scans
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 150 ECG-triggered CT scans acquired during standard cardiac CT sessions, used for training a deep learning model to synthesize contrast-enhanced images.
   - **Details**: The scans include both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced images, with manual segmentation provided for the left atrium and left ventricle by expert radiologists.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I include all relevant details about the dataset, even though it lacks a formal citation.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: ECG-triggered CT scans
- **Description**: 150 ECG-triggered CT scans used for deep learning model training.
- **Details**: Includes imaging parameters and manual segmentations.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly extracted and documented the dataset information from the research paper.
