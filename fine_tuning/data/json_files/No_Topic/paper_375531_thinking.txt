To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonlinear Kalman Filtering with Reparametrization Gradients" by San Gultekin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be useful.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section may include references to datasets used for training or testing their models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous studies that utilized specific datasets.

I will also examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that detail the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation, which might look like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

If the paper references any other datasets, I will follow the same process to extract their names and full citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research.
