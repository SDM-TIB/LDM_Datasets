To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Measuring and Quantifying Performance: Error Rates, Surrogate Loss, and an Example in SSL" by Marco Loog et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of comparing classifiers and mentions empirical results, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly state that they used **eight datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**. This is a clear indication that datasets are present, and I need to gather their names and details.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) listing the datasets along with their basic properties. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Haberman**: 306 objects, 3 dimensions.
2. **Ionosphere**: 351 objects, 33 dimensions.
3. **Pima**: 768 objects, 8 dimensions.
4. **Sonar**: 208 objects, 60 dimensions.
5. **Spect**: 267 objects, 22 dimensions.
6. **Spectf**: 267 objects, 44 dimensions.
7. **Transfusion**: 748 objects, 3 dimensions.
8. **WDBC**: 569 objects, 30 dimensions.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, since these datasets are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I will use the general citation for the repository itself:

- For the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the citation is:
  > K. Bache and M. Lichman. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source of these datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
