To extract datasets from the research paper titled "V3H: View Variation and View Heredity for Incomplete Multi-view Clustering" by Xiang Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on **fifteen benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **Section V (Performance Evaluation)**. Here, they list the datasets along with their characteristics such as the number of samples, views, features, and clusters.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **3-Sources**: This dataset consists of 169 samples collected from 3 views, categorized into 6 clusters. The features are derived from three news sources: BBC, Reuters, and The Guardian.

2. **20 New Groups (20-NGs)**: This dataset contains 500 samples from 3 views, categorized into 5 clusters, with each view having 500 features.

3. **100 Leaves (100-Ls)**: This dataset has 1600 samples from 100 clusters, with each sample appearing in 3 views, each having 64 features.

4. **BBC with 3 views (BBC (3v))**: This dataset includes 282 samples described by 3 views, categorized into 5 clusters.

5. **BBC with 4 views (BBC (4v))**: This dataset consists of 685 samples described by 4 views, also categorized into 5 clusters.

6. **BBCSport with 2 views (BS (2v))**: This dataset has 544 samples described by 2 views, categorized into 5 clusters.

7. **BBCSport with 4 views (BS (4v))**: This dataset includes 116 samples described by 4 views, categorized into 5 clusters.

8. **BUAA**: This dataset has 180 samples categorized into 10 clusters, described by 2 views.

9. **Coil**: This dataset consists of 1440 samples categorized into 20 clusters, with each sample appearing in 3 views.

10. **Digit**: This dataset has 2000 samples categorized into 10 clusters, described by 5 views.

11. **NUS**: This dataset consists of 2400 samples categorized into 12 clusters, described by 6 views.

12. **ORL**: This dataset has 400 samples categorized into 40 clusters, described by 3 views.

13. **Scene**: This dataset consists of 2688 samples categorized into 8 clusters, described by 4 views.

14. **Yale**: This dataset has 165 samples categorized into 15 clusters, described by 3 views.

15. **YaleB**: This dataset consists of 2414 samples described by 3 views, with a subset of 650 samples used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for each dataset, but I can infer that many of these datasets are well-known and can be found in the literature. For example:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
