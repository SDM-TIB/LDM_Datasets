To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-Assisted Automated Reasoning with Flyspeck" by Cezary Kaliszyk and Josef Urban, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the Flyspeck project and its use of automated theorem provers and machine-learning methods, which suggests that there may be datasets related to theorem proving and formal mathematics.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to contain detailed information about datasets. The **experiments** section is a key area where datasets used for evaluation are typically described. I will also check the **methods** and **results** sections for any mentions of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I find that the authors discuss the use of the Flyspeck library and the number of theorems that were proved. They mention that there are **14185 named theorems** and provide statistics about the performance of various automated theorem provers (ATPs) on these theorems. This indicates that the Flyspeck library itself is a dataset.

I will also look for any references to external datasets or benchmarks that may have been used in conjunction with the Flyspeck project. The authors mention the **MPTP2078 benchmark** and other datasets related to automated reasoning, which I will need to document.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. Here are the datasets I have identified:

1. **Flyspeck Library**: This is the main dataset used in the experiments, consisting of 14185 named theorems.
   - Citation: Hales, T. C., et al. (2010). "A revision of the proof of the Kepler Conjecture." *Discrete & Computational Geometry*, 44(1), 1-34.

2. **MPTP2078 Benchmark**: A benchmark for evaluating automated theorem provers.
   - Citation: Urban, J. (2006). "MPTP - Motivation, Implementation, First Experiments." *Journal of Automated Reasoning*, 33(3-4), 319-339.

3. **CASC LTB**: A competition benchmark for large-theory automated theorem proving.
   - Citation: Urban, J., et al. (2011). "An Overview of Methods for Large-Theory Automated Theorem Proving." In *ATE Workshop*, 3-8.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset. This will allow for proper referencing and further exploration of the datasets used in the research.
