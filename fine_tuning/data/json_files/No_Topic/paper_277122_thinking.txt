To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Selection in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO System using Convolutional Neural Networks" by Salman Khalid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a CNN framework for user selection but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the dataset generation process.

In **section III (CNN Based User Selection)**, the authors mention that the dataset is generated from **100,000 independent channel realizations**. They state that an exhaustive search method is used to generate class labels for each channel realization, which indicates that the dataset consists of channel matrices and their corresponding labels for user selection.

Next, I will look for any specific references to existing datasets or any citations that might provide more context about the dataset used. However, the paper does not cite any external datasets; instead, it describes how the dataset is generated through simulations.

Since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves, I will note that the dataset is not publicly available or referenced from another source. Therefore, I will create a dataset entry based on the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset, including the description of how it was generated and the context in which it was used. The dataset is based on channel realizations, and the authors have created it specifically for their experiments.

Finally, I will ensure to include the full citation of the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for the dataset information.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Salman Khalid, Waqas bin Abbas, Farhan Khalid, Michele Zorzi. "User Selection in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO System using Convolutional Neural Networks." IEEE Communications Letters, 2023.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
