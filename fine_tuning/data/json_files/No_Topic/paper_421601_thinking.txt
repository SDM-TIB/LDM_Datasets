To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dueling Over Dessert, Mastering the Art of Repeated Cake Cutting" by Simina Br√¢nzei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any phrases that indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant citations.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. This section may also provide insights into the performance metrics associated with each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are easily accessible and properly credited.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
