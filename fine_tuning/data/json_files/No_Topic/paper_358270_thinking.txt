To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Novice Type Error Diagnosis with Natural Language Models" by Chuqin Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and evaluation metric)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention two primary datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning:

1. **GitHub-OCaml dataset**: This dataset consists of over 350,000 OCaml programs collected from the top 500 OCaml GitHub repositories. It is noted that the dataset is filtered to remove automatically generated programs, making it suitable for training models on real-world code.

2. **Student-OCaml dataset**: This dataset includes around 20,000 OCaml programs collected from homework submissions by students in an undergraduate programming languages course at McGill University. This dataset is particularly valuable for understanding novice programming errors.

In the same section, the authors also reference a third dataset used for fine-tuning:

3. **Nate’s dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,000 labeled programs collected from an undergraduate Programming Languages course at UC San Diego during Spring 2014 and Fall 2015. It provides ground truth labels for various types of type errors, making it essential for evaluating the model's performance.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **GitHub-OCaml dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geng, C., Ye, H., Li, Y., Han, T., Pientka, B., & Si, X. (2022). Novice Type Error Diagnosis with Natural Language Models. *Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)*. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7055133

- For the **Student-OCaml dataset**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same study.

- For **Nate’s dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seidel, E.L., Sibghat, H., Chaudhuri, K., Weimer, W., & Jhala, R. (2017). Learning to blame: localizing novice type errors with data-driven diagnosis. *Proceedings of the ACM Programing Language (OOPSLA)*, 1(1), 60:1–60:27. https://doi.org/10.1145/3138818

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
