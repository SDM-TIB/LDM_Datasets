To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Robust Biotechnological Processes Regarding Variabilities using Multi-Objective Optimization Applied to a Biopharmaceutical Seed Train Design" by Tanja Hernández Rodríguez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets or simulations used. 

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any references to specific datasets or simulations.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This section may also include tables or figures that present data derived from the datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset related to cell culture processes, I will look for the original source of that dataset in the references. If the dataset is a simulation or a model developed by the authors, I will note that as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
