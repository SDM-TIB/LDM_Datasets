To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of Diabetes Mellitus using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization and Least Squares Support Vector Machine," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed algorithm is evaluated using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from the UCI repository, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might provide more details about the dataset. In this case, the **experimental results** section discusses the dataset in more detail, confirming that it consists of **768 records** with **8 features**. The paper also provides a table (Table I) that outlines the features of the dataset, which includes attributes like the number of times pregnant, plasma glucose concentration, and others.

I will also check the **conclusion** section to ensure that the dataset is consistently referenced throughout the paper, which it is, as the authors emphasize the effectiveness of their algorithm on this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. The dataset is commonly cited as follows:

- For the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith, S. W., & Smith, J. (1988). *Pima Indians Diabetes Database*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
