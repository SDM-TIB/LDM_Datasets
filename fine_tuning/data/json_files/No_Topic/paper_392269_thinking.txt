To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering how agents learn using few data" by Iosif Sakos, Antonios Varvitsiotis, and Georgios Piliouras, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach... accurately recovers the true dynamics across various benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then look into the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section often contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional context or analysis related to the datasets. The authors may discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets, which could provide further insights into the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **"Penn Action Dataset"**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Similarly, if they mention another dataset like the **"sub-JHMDB Dataset"**, I will find its citation, which could be:
> Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications. This structured output will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily accessed by others interested in the datasets used in this research.
