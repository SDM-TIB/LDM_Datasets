To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taming and Leveraging Interference in Mobile Radar Networks" by Husheng Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses simulations related to radar interference in vehicular networks, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the data used for simulations or evaluations. I will pay attention to any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the presence of datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant parameters.

In the **numerical simulations section**, the author describes the setup and parameters used for the simulations. I will look for any references to datasets that were collected or generated during these simulations. For example, the paper mentions collecting data on radar interference events, which may imply a dataset.

I will also check the **appendices and references** for any additional information about datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets or provide citations for datasets used in their research, I will note these down.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves. I will look for citations in the references section that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to radar interference, I will find the corresponding citation in the references and document it fully.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
