To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProportionNet: Balancing Fairness and Revenue for Auction Design with Deep Learning" by Kevin Kuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning techniques to auction design, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about auctions and mentions the use of machine learning but does not explicitly name any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain specific details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **methodology** section, the authors describe their approach and mention that they use training data consisting of bid profiles sampled from valuation distributions. However, they do not specify any particular datasets at this point.

In the **experiments** section, the authors detail various settings for their experiments. They mention using known valuation distributions for training but do not provide specific dataset names. Instead, they refer to settings labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F, which describe different auction configurations and the parameters used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references include various papers related to auction design and fairness in machine learning, but they do not specifically mention datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not use publicly available datasets or did not explicitly name any datasets in their work. Instead, they focused on generating synthetic data based on valuation distributions for their experiments.

In conclusion, I will document that no specific datasets were extracted from this paper, as the authors primarily utilized synthetic data generated from valuation distributions rather than established datasets. Therefore, there are no full citations to provide for datasets in this case.
