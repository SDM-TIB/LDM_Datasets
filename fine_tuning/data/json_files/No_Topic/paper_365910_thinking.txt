To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brazilian listed options with discrete dividends and the fast Laplace transform" by Maikon Ara√∫jo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a numerical procedure for pricing options, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets or data sources. The introduction primarily discusses theoretical foundations and previous works but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that might present data. The results section includes tables comparing the performance of the proposed method against benchmarks, but it does not explicitly mention datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets. The references include works by Thakoor and Bhuruth (2018), Haug (2007), and others, but these are primarily theoretical papers and do not seem to provide datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the author discusses methodologies and comparisons with existing models, there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is on the numerical methods and theoretical contributions rather than empirical data.

Since no datasets are explicitly identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have ensured to retrieve their full citations from the references section and provide a detailed description of each dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, no citations can be provided.
