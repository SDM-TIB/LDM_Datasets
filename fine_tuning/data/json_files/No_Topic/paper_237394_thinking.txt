To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wireless Fingerprinting via Deep Learning: The Impact of Confounding Factors" by Metehan Cekic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract hints at the use of data from **WiFi and ADS-B protocols**, which suggests that these are the datasets I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors discuss their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention using two types of data:

1. **WiFi Dataset**: This dataset consists of packets from 19 commercial-off-the-shelf devices collected indoors without channel distortion using a Tektronix RSA5126B receiver. The authors specify that the dataset includes signals sampled at 200 MHz.

2. **ADS-B Dataset**: This dataset includes air traffic control signals collected from 100 airplanes over a span of 10 days using a Tektronix RSA5106B receiver. The signals are used for transmitting airplane position and velocity information, with a sampling rate of 20 MHz.

I will also check the **contributions section** to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for the experiments and to ensure I have the correct context for their use.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **WiFi Dataset**:
  > IEEE Std 802.11a, Wireless LAN Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications: High Speed Physical layer in the 5 GHz band, 1999.

- For the **ADS-B Dataset**:
  > The ADS-B signals are based on the standards set by the FAA and are widely documented in various aviation communication literature.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for any further analysis or reporting.
