To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to De-reserve Reserves: Admissions to Technical Colleges in India" by Orhan Aygün and Bertan Turhan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used for analysis or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context and significance of their research. If they reference any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section may include information about the source of the data, the size of the datasets, and how they were utilized in the analysis.

Following that, I will check the **results** section to see if the authors present any findings based on the datasets. They may provide statistics or insights derived from the data, which can help confirm the datasets' relevance and importance.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them thoroughly, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "National Technical College Admissions Dataset," I would note its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics, along with a citation such as:

> Aygün, O., & Turhan, B. (2022). *How to De-reserve Reserves: Admissions to Technical Colleges in India*. [Dataset]. Retrieved from [URL or DOI if available].

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
