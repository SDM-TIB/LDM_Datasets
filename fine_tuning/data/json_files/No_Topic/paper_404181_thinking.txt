To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RSVP: Customer Intent Detection via Agent Response Contrastive and Generative Pre-Training" by Yu-Chien Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on "two real-world customer service datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Intent Detection Datasets with Responses)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **KKday Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,276 samples of customer utterance-response pairs collected from KKday, an e-commerce travel platform. The authors note that the dataset was annotated by 8 agents and includes multi-turn dialogues.

2. **TwACS Dataset**: This is a public English dataset with 491 samples, consisting of conversations between customer service agents and customers on various topics discussed in Twitter posts.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **KKday Dataset**, the citation is:
  > KKday. *KKday Customer Service Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kkday.com/en-us.

- For the **TwACS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Perkins, H., & Yang, Y. (2019). *Dialog intent induction with deep multi-view clustering*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 4016â€“4025, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation for proper attribution.
