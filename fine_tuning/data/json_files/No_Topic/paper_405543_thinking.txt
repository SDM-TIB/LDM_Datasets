To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Detection of LLMs-Generated Content" by Xianjun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses detection strategies and benchmarks, which suggests that datasets will be mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for detection tasks. Here, they list several datasets, including:

1. **TURINGBENCH**: A benchmark environment for Turing tests in the age of neural text generation.
2. **HC3**: A dataset that includes both long- and short-level documents from various sources.
3. **CHEAT**: A dataset for detecting ChatGPT-written abstracts.
4. **Ghostbuster**: A detection benchmark covering various types of documents.
5. **OpenGPTText**: A dataset consisting of rephrased content generated using ChatGPT.
6. **M4**: A large-scale benchmark for machine-generated text detection.
7. **MULTITuDE**: A multilingual machine-generated text detection benchmark.
8. **MGTBench**: Focused on ChatGPT-generated content.
9. **SAID**: Curated for real AI-generated text from social media platforms.
10. **HC3 Plus**: An extended version of HC3 with more task types.

I will also check the **Appendix A.3** for detailed descriptions of these datasets, which will provide additional context and specifics about their content and purpose.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for their full citations in the **References section**. This is crucial for proper attribution. For example, I will find the citation for **CHEAT** as follows:

- **CHEAT**: Yu et al., 2023a. This dataset provides 35,304 synthetic academic abstracts.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring I capture the authors, year, title, and publication details for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets discussed in the paper, complete with proper citations for each.
