To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuralMeshing: Differentiable Meshing of Implicit Neural Representations" by Mathias Vetsch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and while it may not explicitly name datasets, it can hint at their existence. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a subset of the **D-Faust dataset** and the **ShapeNet dataset** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors state that they used a subset of the **D-Faust dataset**, which contains high-resolution scans of humans in different poses and corresponding triangle meshes. They also mention that they used **ShapeNet**, specifically a selected subset of shapes belonging to the file cabinet category, for training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **D-Faust dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bogo, F., Romero, J., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M.J. (2017). Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. For the **ShapeNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chang, A.X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository. Tech. Rep. arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
