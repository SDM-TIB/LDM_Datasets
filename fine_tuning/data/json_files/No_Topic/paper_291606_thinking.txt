To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk aggregation and capital allocation using a new generalized Archimedean copula" by Fouad Marri and Khouzeima Moutanabbir, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, potentially naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or data sources**. In many research papers, authors explicitly describe the datasets they used for their analyses in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of the datasets mentioned.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the analysis. Authors often mention datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous studies.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Bernstein Copula Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another study, I will ensure to cite the original source.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
