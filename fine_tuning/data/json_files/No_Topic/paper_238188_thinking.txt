To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicitly Defined Layers in Neural Networks" by Qianggong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I will focus on sections that are likely to mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. If the authors reference any datasets or benchmark tasks, I will note them down. 

I will then examine the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are described in detail). This section may include specific datasets used for validation or testing of the proposed methods. I will look for any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I notice that the authors mention several applications and showcase problems. I will pay particular attention to any datasets referenced in these examples, especially in sections discussing **example applications** or **experiments**.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for evaluating their method, I will look for the full citation in the references. The citation for ShapeNet is:
> Chang, A.X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012 (2015).

Similarly, if they reference the **CUB-200-2011 dataset**, I will find its citation:
> Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., Belongie, S. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology (2011).

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
