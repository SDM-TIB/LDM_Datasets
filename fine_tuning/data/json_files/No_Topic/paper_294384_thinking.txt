To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Parametric Quickest Detection of a Change in the Mean of an Observation Sequence" by Yuchen Liang and Venugopal V. Veeravalli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used. The introduction often discusses the context and applications of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical results or simulations that might indicate the datasets used for validation. The authors mention validating their analysis through numerical results for detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution, which suggests that they used specific datasets for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets. In this case, the authors mention using data from various counties in the US for pandemic monitoring. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, specifically related to COVID-19 case data.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **COVID-19 Data from Various Counties in the US**: This dataset is used for monitoring the spread of COVID-19. The authors reference the source as:
   > Rearc. AWS Marketplace: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Data in the United States â€” The New York Times. Available: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/Coronavirus-COVID-19-Data-in-the-United-States-The/prodview-jmb464qw2yg74

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets or specific names for other datasets, I will focus on this one.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the full citation for the dataset and prepare to format this information as needed for downstream processing.
