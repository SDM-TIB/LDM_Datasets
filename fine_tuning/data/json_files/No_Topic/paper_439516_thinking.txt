To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PyramidKV: Dynamic KV Cache Compression based on Pyramidal Information Funneling" by Zefan Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using the **LongBench benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark may contain multiple datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used **LongBench** to evaluate their method, which is a benchmark suite designed for long-context inputs. This section will likely provide details about the specific datasets included in LongBench.

In **section 5.2 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention 17 datasets covering various tasks, including:

1. **Single-Document QA**: 
   - **NarrativeQA**: A dataset for reading comprehension based on narratives.
   - **Qasper**: A dataset for question answering based on scientific papers.
   - **MultiFieldQA-en**: A dataset for multi-field question answering.

2. **Multi-Document QA**:
   - **HotpotQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering.
   - **2WikiMultihopQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering across two Wikipedia articles.
   - **MuSiQue**: A dataset for multi-document question answering.

3. **Summarization**:
   - **GovReport**: A dataset for summarizing government reports.
   - **QMSum**: A dataset for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization.
   - **MultiNews**: A dataset for multi-document summarization.

4. **Few-shot Learning**:
   - **TREC**: A dataset for question classification.
   - **TriviaQA**: A large-scale dataset for reading comprehension.
   - **SAMSum**: A dataset for dialogue summarization.

5. **Synthetic Task**:
   - **PassageCount**: A dataset for passage retrieval tasks.
   - **PassageRetrieval-en**: A dataset for English passage retrieval tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the LongBench benchmark are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
