To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAPPING: Model Average with Post-processing for Stroke Lesion Segmentation" by Jiayu Huo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their segmentation model to the **Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS v2.0)** dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the evolution of stroke lesion segmentation datasets. They mention the **ATLAS v1.2 dataset** and its limitations, which leads to the introduction of **ATLAS v2.0**. This section provides context for the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methods section**, particularly in **section 2.1**, the authors describe the structure of the **ATLAS v2.0 dataset** in detail. They specify that it contains 1271 T1-weighted MRIs with manually annotated lesion masks, divided into training, public test, and hidden test sets. This confirms that **ATLAS v2.0** is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any clarifications regarding the datasets used. However, the focus remains on the **ATLAS v2.0 dataset** throughout the paper.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **ATLAS v2.0**, the citation is:
   > Liew, S.L., Lo, B.P., Donnelly, M.R., Zavaliangos-Petropulu, A., Jeong, J.N., Barisano, G., Hutton, A., Simon, J.P., Juliano, J.M., Suri, A., et al. *A large, curated, open-source stroke neuroimaging dataset to improve lesion segmentation algorithms*. Scientific Data 9(1), 1–12, 2022.

2. For **ATLAS v1.2**, the citation is:
   > Liew, S.L., Anglin, J.M., Banks, N.W., Sondag, M., Ito, K.L., Kim, H., Chan, J., Ito, J., Jung, C., Khoshab, N., et al. *A large, open source dataset of stroke anatomical brain images and manual lesion segmentations*. Scientific Data 5(1), 1–11, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
