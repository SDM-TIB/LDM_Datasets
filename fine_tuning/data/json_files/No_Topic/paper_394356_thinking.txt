To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moreau-Yoshida Variational Transport: A General Framework for Solving Regularized Distributional Optimization Problems" by Dai Hai Nguyen and Tetsuya Sakurai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically described.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on **synthetic datasets**. They describe two case studies involving different nonsmooth functions (l1-norm and total variation semi-norm) but do not provide specific names for these datasets. Instead, they refer to the datasets as generated examples based on certain conditions.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **related works section** or the **conclusion**. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on synthetic data generated for their experiments rather than established datasets.

Since the paper does not cite any specific datasets with full references, I will note that the experiments are based on synthetic data generated under specific conditions rather than publicly available datasets. 

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, specifically:
   - Case Study 1: Involves generating 500 examples with Gaussian noise added to a sparse vector.
   - Case Study 2: Involves generating 500 examples with Gaussian noise added to a locally smooth vector.
   - Case Study 3: Focuses on image denoising using a truth image degraded by Gaussian noise.

Since these datasets are not publicly available or formally cited, I will note that they are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that they are synthetic and not formally cited in the references section of the paper.
