To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphMLP: A Graph MLP-Like Architecture for 3D Human Pose Estimation" by Wenhao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention two datasets: **Human3.6M** and **MPI-INF-3DHP**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is described as the largest benchmark for 3D human pose estimation, containing 3.6 million video frames captured by a motion capture system with 11 professional actors performing 15 actions.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: This dataset is noted for containing both indoor and outdoor scenes, with a test set consisting of three different scenes: studio with green screen, studio without green screen, and outdoor scene.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE TPAMI, vol. 36, no. 7, pp. 1325–1339, 2013.

- For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > D. Mehta, H. Rhodin, D. Casas, P. Fua, O. Sotnychenko, W. Xu, and C. Theobalt. *Monocular 3D human pose estimation in the wild using improved CNN supervision*. In 3DV, 2017, pp. 506–516.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
