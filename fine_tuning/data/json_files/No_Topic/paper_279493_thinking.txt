To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Topological Filter for Learning with Label Noise" by Pengxiang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is validated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also widely used in the field of machine learning.

3. **Clothing1M**: This dataset consists of 1 million clothing images collected from online shopping websites, with 14 classes. The labels in this dataset are known to be noisy, making it a challenging dataset for testing label noise handling methods.

4. **ModelNet40**: A dataset containing 12,311 CAD models from 40 categories, used for point cloud classification. It includes 9,843 models for training and 2,468 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
