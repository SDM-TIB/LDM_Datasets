To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Navigable maps of structural brain networks across species" by Antoine Allard and M. Ángeles Serrano, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on connectomes across species, which suggests that datasets related to brain networks will be discussed.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 2 (Results)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used. They mention that the datasets cover various species and correspond to structural connectomes at different levels (microscopic and mesoscopic/macroscopic). This section will likely contain specific names of the datasets.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets, including their names, types of nodes, brain regions covered, and whether spatial information is available. The datasets listed include:

1. **C. Elegans**: A dataset of neuronal connections at the cell level in the nervous system.
2. **Drosophila1**: A dataset of neuronal connections at the cell level in the optic medulla.
3. **Drosophila2**: Another dataset of neuronal connections at the cell level in the optic medulla.
4. **ZebraFinch1**: A dataset of connections at the area level in the basal ganglia (Area X).
5. **Mouse1**: A dataset of connections at the area level in the whole brain.
6. **Mouse2**: A dataset of connections at the cell level in the retina.
7. **Macaque1**: A dataset of connections at the area level in the cortex.
8. **Human1**: A dataset of connections at the area level in the cortex (two hemispheres).
9. **Human2**: A dataset of connections at the area level in the cortex (one hemisphere).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **C. Elegans** dataset is:
> Varshney, L. R., Chen, B. L., Paniagua, E., Hall, D. H., & Chklovskii, D. B. (2011). Structural Properties of the Caenorhabditis elegans Neuronal Network. *PLoS Comput. Biol.*, 7(2), e1001066.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned in Table I, ensuring to note the authors, title, journal, and publication year.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize this information in a clear format, ready for further processing or presentation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
