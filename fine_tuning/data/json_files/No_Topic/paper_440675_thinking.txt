To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatchSVD: A Non-uniform SVD-based Image Compression Algorithm" by Zahra Golpayegani and Nizar Bouguila, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed PatchSVD algorithm and its comparison with JPEG and SVD, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about image compression but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluated their method on the **Kodak** and **CLIC** datasets. This is a crucial finding, as it directly indicates the datasets utilized in their experiments.

In **section 5.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, the authors provide details about each dataset:

1. **Kodak Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 24 full-color images, either 768x512 or 512x768 pixels in size. It is noted for capturing a variety of lighting conditions and subjects, making it a classic dataset for evaluating image compression algorithms.

2. **CLIC Dataset**: The CLIC dataset was introduced for the Challenge on Learned Image Compression in 2020 and includes both RGB and grayscale images. The authors mention using the test split, which comprises 428 samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Kodak Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kodak. *Kodak lossless true color image suite*. Last accessed on 2023-11-14.

- For the **CLIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Toderici, G., Shi, W., Timofte, R., Theis, L., Balle, J., Agustsson, E., Johnston, N., and Mentzer, F. (2020). *Workshop and challenge on learned image compression (clic2020)*. Last accessed on 2023-11-14.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references for future use or processing.
