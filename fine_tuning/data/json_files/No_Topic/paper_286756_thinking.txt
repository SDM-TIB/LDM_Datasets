To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Mitigating Accuracy Disparity in Regression" by Jianfeng Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **five benchmark datasets** to corroborate their theoretical findings. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is used for income prediction based on various attributes, including gender as a sensitive attribute. The authors note that it contains 48,842 examples.

2. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict recidivism among criminal defendants. It contains 6,172 instances and uses race as a sensitive attribute.

3. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: This dataset contains socio-economic and crime data about communities in the U.S. and is used to predict the number of violent crimes per 100K population.

4. **Law School Dataset**: This dataset includes records of law students and is used to predict undergraduate GPA, with gender as the sensitive attribute.

5. **Medical Insurance Cost Dataset**: This dataset contains medical expense examples for patients in the U.S. and uses gender as the sensitive attribute.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Adult Dataset**:

- **COMPAS Dataset**: 
  > Dieterich, W., Mendoza, C., & Brennan, T. (2016). COMPAS risk scales: Demonstrating accuracy equity and predictive parity. Northpointe Inc.

- **Communities and Crime Dataset**:

- **Medical Insurance Cost Dataset**: 
  > Lantz, B. (2013). Machine Learning with R. Packt Publishing Ltd.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
