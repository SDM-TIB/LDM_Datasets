To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blindly Assess Quality of In-the-Wild Videos via Quality-aware Pre-training and Motion Perception" by Bowen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of blind video quality assessment (BVQA) and mentions the use of multiple databases for training and evaluation, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention six benchmarking databases for evaluating their method:

1. **CVD2014**: This database is used for evaluating no-reference video quality assessment algorithms. It contains 234 videos with various resolutions and quality annotations.

2. **KoNViD-1k**: This is a natural video database consisting of 1,200 videos, which are annotated for quality assessment.

3. **LIVE-Qualcomm**: This database includes 208 videos and is used for assessing video quality.

4. **LIVE-VQC**: This database contains 585 videos and is another resource for evaluating video quality.

5. **YouTube-UGC**: This dataset consists of 39,072 videos, specifically designed for video compression research.

6. **LSVQ**: This database includes 39,072 videos and is used for evaluating video quality.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
