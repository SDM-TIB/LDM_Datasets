To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embarrassingly Parallel Variational Inference in Nonconjugate Models" by Willie Neiswanger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical study sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the development of a variational inference procedure but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction mentions various types of data collected in distributed settings, but again, no specific datasets are named.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical study section** where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using the **SUSY particles dataset** for a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** section, particularly in the context of the nonlinear matrix factorization model. However, the primary dataset used for empirical evaluation appears to be the SUSY dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SUSY dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
> "SUSY particles dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY"

This citation provides a direct link to the dataset, which is essential for proper documentation.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The key dataset extracted from this paper is the SUSY particles dataset, which is used to evaluate the proposed variational inference method.

In summary, the steps taken are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the empirical study section to identify specific datasets.
3. Document the SUSY particles dataset and retrieve its citation from the references.
4. Prepare the dataset information for structured output.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
