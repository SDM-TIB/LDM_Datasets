To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIPPM: a Deep Learning Inference Performance Predictive Model using Graph Neural Networks" by Karthick Panner Selvam and Mats Brorsson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors constructed a **graph multi-regression dataset** consisting of 10,508 different DL models, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (The DIPPM Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset contains 10,508 graphs for graph-level multi-regression problems, and they describe the variables included in each data point: the Node feature matrix (X), Adjacency Matrix (A), static features (Fs), and the target variables (Y) which consist of inference latency, memory usage, and energy consumption.

The authors also explain that they used the Nvidia Management Library and CUDA toolkit to measure the energy, memory, and inference latency of each model in the dataset. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and the methodology used to collect the data.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset is open-sourced and will provide a URL in the camera-ready version of the paper. However, since the URL is not provided in the current version, I will note that the dataset is referenced as follows:

- **DIPPM Dataset**: A graph-level multi-regression dataset containing 10,508 DL models for performance prediction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the available information, ensuring to include the citation format as required. Since the dataset is open-sourced, I will mention that the URL will be provided later.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
