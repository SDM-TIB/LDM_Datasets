To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ein Beitrag zur durchgängigen, formalen Verhaltensspezifikation automatisierter Straßenfahrzeuge" by Nayel Fabian Salem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and may explicitly mention the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are utilized in the research.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the outcomes related to these datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of their relevance.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark," I will look for its citation, which might be formatted as follows:
> "M. Neumann, T. H. Weisswange, and F. Kummert. *German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), pages 378–385, 2014."

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be utilized effectively in future research or applications.
