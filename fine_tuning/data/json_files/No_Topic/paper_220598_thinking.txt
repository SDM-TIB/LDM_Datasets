To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Targeted Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis" by Jeremy Barnes and Roman Klinger, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a cross-lingual approach to sentiment analysis, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Resources)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **OpeNER Corpora**: This dataset consists of hotel reviews annotated for aspect-based sentiment analysis in English and Spanish. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Agerri, R., Bermudez, J., & Rigau, G. (2013). OpeNER: Open polarity enhanced named entity recognition. In Sociedad Espa˜nola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural, Vol. 51, pp. 215–218.

2. **MultiBooked Corpora**: This dataset contains hotel reviews annotated similarly to the OpeNER corpora but in Basque and Catalan. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Barnes, J., Klinger, R., & Schulte im Walde, S. (2018). MultiBooked: A corpus of Basque and Catalan hotel reviews annotated for aspect-level sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 11th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC’18).

3. **SemEval 2016 Task 5**: This dataset includes restaurant review corpora in English and Spanish, annotated for three levels of sentiment. The citation is:
   > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., Manandhar, S., & Stoyanov, V. (2016). SemEval-2016 task 5: Aspect based sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pp. 19–30.

4. **USAGE Corpora**: This dataset consists of Amazon reviews in English and German, annotated for three levels of sentiment. The citation is:
   > Klinger, R., & Cimiano, P. (2014). The USAGE review corpus for fine-grained multilingual opinion analysis. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), pp. 2211–2218.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they are used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information gathered, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.
