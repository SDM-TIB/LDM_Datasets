To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaTroll: Few-shot Detection of State-Sponsored Trolls with Transformer Adapters" by Lin Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset released by Twitter that contains user accounts associated with state-sponsored influence activities. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the "information operations dataset published by Twitter," which contains various groups of users banned for engaging in state-sponsored information operations. They also provide specific campaign examples, such as "Iran-2018-Palestine" and "Russia-2016-MAGA," which are crucial for identifying the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics for different campaigns, including the number of users and hashtags associated with each campaign. This table will help me gather detailed information about the datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Information Operations Dataset**: This dataset includes various campaigns defined by Twitter, such as "Iran-2018-Palestine," "Russia-2016-MAGA," and others. It contains user accounts banned for engaging in state-sponsored influence operations.

2. **Campaign-Specific Datasets**: The paper lists several campaigns, each representing a specific dataset:
   - **Iran-2018-Palestine**: Users involved in the campaign targeting Palestine.
   - **Russia-2016-MAGA**: Users involved in the campaign related to the 2016 US Presidential election.
   - **Iran-2018-Pakistan**: Users involved in the campaign targeting Pakistan.
   - **Venezuela-2018-Trump**: Users involved in the campaign related to Trump.
   - **Nigeria-2019-Racism**: Users involved in the campaign addressing racism.
   - **Iran-2020-BLM**: Users involved in the Black Lives Matter campaign.
   - **GRU-2020-NATO**: Users involved in the NATO-related campaign.
   - **IRA-2020-Russia**: Users involved in the Russian influence campaign.
   - **Uganda-2021-NRM**: Users involved in the campaign related to Uganda.
   - **China-2021-Xinjiang**: Users involved in the campaign concerning Xinjiang.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Twitter dataset and its associated blog posts for more information. The citations for the campaigns can be derived from the blog posts linked in the paper.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Information Operations Dataset**:
  > Twitter. *Information Operations*. Available at: https://transparency.twitter.com/en/reports/information-operations.html

- For the specific campaigns, the citations can be referenced from the blog posts:
  > Twitter. *Enabling Further Research of Information Operations on Twitter*. Available at: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/enabling-further-research-of-information-operations-on-twitter

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
