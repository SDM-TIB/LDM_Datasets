To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Prediction of Beta-Amyloid and Tau Burden Using Hippocampal Surface Multivariate Morphometry Statistics and Sparse Coding" by Jianfeng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on amyloid PET/MRI and tau PET/MRI datasets from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **methods section**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They state that data were obtained from the ADNI database, which is a significant dataset for Alzheimer's research. They specify that they analyzed two sets of scans: one for amyloid deposition and another for tau deposition. 

In the **results section**, the authors provide details about the number of subjects and scans used for each dataset:
1. **Amyloid PET/MRI Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,127 pairs of T1-weighted MRI and florbetapir PET images from 1,109 participants.
2. **Tau PET/MRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of 925 pairs of MRI scans and AV1451 PET images from 688 subjects.

Now, I will check the **acknowledgments and references sections** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The ADNI is a well-known initiative, and its citation is typically included in the references. The citation for the ADNI is:
> Mueller SG, Weiner MW, Thal LJ, Petersen RC, Jack C, Jagust W, Trojanowski JQ, Toga AW, Beckett L. *The Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative*. Neuroimaging Clin N Am 15(4), 869–77, xi–xii, 2005.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Amyloid PET/MRI Dataset**: 1,127 pairs of T1-weighted MRI and florbetapir PET images from 1,109 participants.
   - Citation: Mueller SG, Weiner MW, Thal LJ, Petersen RC, Jack C, Jagust W, Trojanowski JQ, Toga AW, Beckett L. *The Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative*. Neuroimaging Clin N Am 15(4), 869–77, xi–xii, 2005.

2. **Tau PET/MRI Dataset**: 925 pairs of MRI scans and AV1451 PET images from 688 subjects.
   - Citation: Mueller SG, Weiner MW, Thal LJ, Petersen RC, Jack C, Jagust W, Trojanowski JQ, Toga AW, Beckett L. *The Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative*. Neuroimaging Clin N Am 15(4), 869–77, xi–xii, 2005.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
