To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariance-powered Trustworthy Defense via Remove Then Restore" by Xiaowei Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Backbones)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 10 classes of handwritten digit images, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset includes 10 classes of common objects, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. It is widely used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

3. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 100 classes, with each class having 600 color images (500 training images and 100 test images). It is also a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured accurately and can be easily accessed later.
