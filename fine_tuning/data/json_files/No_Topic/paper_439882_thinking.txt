To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks" by Lihao Wang and Zhaofei Yu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention conducting experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, but I need to locate their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a clear list of datasets used for their experiments, which includes:

1. **Moving MNIST**: A video sequence dataset generated from the MNIST dataset, consisting of 10,000 sequences, each with 20 frames of two randomly moving digits. The goal is to predict the positions and shapes of the digits in the subsequent frames.

2. **TaxiBJ**: A dataset containing GPS data from taxis in Beijing, used to predict future urban population flow based on historical data.

3. **KTH**: A dataset designed for human action recognition, which includes six different actions performed by individuals in various scenarios.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide statistical summaries of these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Moving MNIST**, the citation is:

- For **TaxiBJ**, the citation is:

- For **KTH**, the citation is:
  > Schuldt, C., Laptev, I., & Caputo, B. (2004). Recognizing human actions: a local SVM approach. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), volume 3, pp. 32–36.

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
