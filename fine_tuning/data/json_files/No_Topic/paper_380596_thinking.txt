To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Humans and Machines Have the Same Eyes? Human-Machine Perceptual Differences on Image Classification" by Minghao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Datasets and model training)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **CIFAR-N**: This dataset is a label-noise benchmark that provides three noisy human annotations for each image of the CIFAR-10 training dataset. The authors specify that they split the training set into a 40K training subset and a 10K test subset.

2. **CIFAR-H**: This dataset is referenced as providing human annotation time information, which is used to analyze human difficulty levels in labeling tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-N**, the citation is:
  > Joshua C. Peterson, Ruairidh M. Battleday, Thomas L. Griffiths, and Olga Russakovsky. *Learning with noisy labels revisited: A study using real-world human annotations*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2022.

- For **CIFAR-H**, the citation is:
  > Joshua C. Peterson, Ruairidh M. Battleday, Thomas L. Griffiths, and Olga Russakovsky. *CIFAR-10H: Human Annotations for CIFAR-10*. Available at: https://github.com/jcpeterson/cifar-10h.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
