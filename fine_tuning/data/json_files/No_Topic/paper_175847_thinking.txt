To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Viseme Vocabulary Construction to Enhance Continuous Lip-reading" by Adriana Fernandez-Lopez and Federico M. Sukno, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of a viseme vocabulary and mentions testing on a Spanish corpus of continuous speech, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 3), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they mention the **AV@CAR dataset**, which is a Spanish corpus for automatic audio-visual speech recognition. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of speakers, the type of recordings, and the conditions under which the data was collected.

I will extract the following details about the AV@CAR dataset:

1. **AV@CAR Dataset**: This dataset is described as a free multichannel multi-modal database for automatic audio-visual speech recognition in Spanish, including both studio and in-car recordings. It consists of sequences from 20 speakers recorded under controlled conditions while repeating predefined phrases or sentences.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the AV@CAR dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **AV@CAR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ortega, A., Sukno, F., Lleida, E., Frangi, A. F., Miguel, A., Buera, L., and Zacur, E. (2004). *AV@CAR: A Spanish multichannel multimodal corpus for in-vehicle automatic audio-visual speech recognition*. In LREC.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the AV@CAR dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
