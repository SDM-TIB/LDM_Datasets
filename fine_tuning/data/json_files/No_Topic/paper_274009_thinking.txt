To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Virtual Historical Simulation for estimating the conditional VaR of large portfolios" by Christian Francq and Jean-Michel Zakoïan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "numerical illustrations on simulated and real data," which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their numerical experiments and mention using "simulated data" and "real financial data." I will need to find out if they provide specific names or sources for these datasets.

In the **numerical illustrations section**, the authors refer to "simulated data" and "real data examples based on large sets of US stocks." They also mention that the data for the US stocks was provided by Sébastien Laurent and described in a previous work. This indicates that there is a dataset related to US stocks that I need to cite.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets or data sources mentioned. The paper references Monte Carlo experiments and various designs for the cDCC-GARCH model, which may include specific datasets or simulation parameters.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Simulated Data**: The paper mentions using simulated data for their experiments, but it does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated by the authors.

2. **Real Financial Data**: The authors state that the real data examples are based on large sets of US stocks, specifically mentioning that the data was provided by Sébastien Laurent and described in:
   > Laurent, S., Lecourt, C., and Palm, F.C. (2016). *Testing for jumps in conditionally Gaussian ARMA-GARCH models, a robust approach*. Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 100, 383–400.

3. **Monte Carlo Experiments**: The designs for the Monte Carlo experiments are based on the cDCC-GARCH model, but again, these are generated datasets and do not have a specific citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I provide full citations for any referenced datasets.

In conclusion, I will create a structured output that includes the datasets identified, along with their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
