To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You Only Cut Once: Boosting Data Augmentation with a Single Cut" by Junlin Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of YOCO to various datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically sections 4 and 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating YOCO on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **ImageNet**: This is a large-scale dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories. It is widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models in various computer vision tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
