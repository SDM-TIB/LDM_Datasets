To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Banker Online Mirror Descent: A Universal Approach for Delayed Online Bandit Learning" by Jiatai Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe the datasets in detail, I will note down this information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the full citation for each one.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is clearly presented.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation practices.
