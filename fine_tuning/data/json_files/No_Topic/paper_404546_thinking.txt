To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Descriptive Knowledge Graph in Biomedical Domain" by Kerui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of a system that organizes descriptive sentences from a biomedical corpus, specifically mentioning the **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)** as a representative corpus. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **methodology sections**, particularly **section 2.1 (Corpus)**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **CORD-19 dataset** to build their descriptive knowledge graph, referred to as **CovidDEER**. This section provides details about the dataset, including its purpose and the number of documents it contains.

I will also check the **experiments and evaluation sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if the CORD-19 dataset is referenced in the context of specific experiments. However, it appears that the focus remains on the CORD-19 dataset throughout the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CORD-19 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19)**:
  > Paul Mooney, Dewey A. Murdick, Devvret Rishi, Jerry Sheehan, Zhihong Shen, Brandon Stilson, Alex D. Wade, Kuansan Wang, Nancy Xin Ru Wang, Christopher Wilhelm, Boya Xie, Douglas M. Raymond, Daniel S. Weld, Oren Etzioni, and Sebastian Kohlmeier. *CORD-19: The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on NLP for COVID-19 at ACL 2020, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the CORD-19 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.
