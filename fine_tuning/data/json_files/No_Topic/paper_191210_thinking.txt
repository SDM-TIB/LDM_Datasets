To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A General Framework for Multi-focal Image Classification and Authentication: Application to Microscope Pollen Images" by François Chung and Tomás Rodríguez, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the methodology is demonstrated on microscope pollen images, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to pollen images.

Next, I will focus on the **Material section** (Section 2), where the authors describe the materials used for their experiments. Here, they mention using a Nikon Eclipse E200-LED microscope and a specific camera for image acquisition. However, I need to look for specific datasets related to pollen types.

In **Section 3 (Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the pollen types used in their experiments. They mention that they have a pollen image database comprising 15 pollen types, which are:

1. Aster
2. Brassica
3. Campanulaceae
4. Carduus
5. Castanea
6. Cistus
7. Cytisus
8. Echium
9. Ericaceae
10. Helianthus
11. Olea
12. Prunus
13. Quercus
14. Salix
15. Teucrium

This section also includes a brief description of each pollen type, including their size, shape, and origin, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Next, I will check the **Results section** (Section 9) to see if the authors mention any specific datasets used for testing their classification and authentication methods. They refer to a training dataset comprising 1800 pollen grain sub-images, which were gathered from the 15 pollen types mentioned earlier.

Additionally, the authors created two additional datasets for testing their authentication method: an inlier dataset and an outlier dataset. The inlier dataset consists of 280 pollen images from 7 types that belong to the training dataset, while the outlier dataset comprises 280 pollen images from 7 types that do not belong to the training dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely original datasets created by the authors. Therefore, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Pollen Image Database**: A dataset comprising 15 pollen types used for classification and authentication.
   - Citation: Chung, F., & Rodríguez, T. (2018). A General Framework for Multi-focal Image Classification and Authentication: Application to Microscope Pollen Images. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

2. **Inlier Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 280 pollen images from 7 types that belong to the training dataset.
   - Citation: Chung, F., & Rodríguez, T. (2018). A General Framework for Multi-focal Image Classification and Authentication: Application to Microscope Pollen Images. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

3. **Outlier Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 280 pollen images from 7 types that do not belong to the training dataset.
   - Citation: Chung, F., & Rodríguez, T. (2018). A General Framework for Multi-focal Image Classification and Authentication: Application to Microscope Pollen Images. *Preprint submitted to Elsevier*.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
