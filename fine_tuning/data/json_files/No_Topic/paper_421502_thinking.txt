To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Text Detoxification as Style Transfer in English and Hindi" by Sourabrata Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset development sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize a dataset provided by Dementieva et al. (2021), which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of text detoxification and mention the dataset from Dementieva et al. (2021) again, emphasizing its importance for their experiments. This section also hints at the creation of a new Hindi dataset, which I need to note.

In the **dataset development section**, the authors provide detailed information about the original dataset from Dementieva et al. (2021). They describe it as a collection of user-generated comments that are toxic in nature, and they mention the process of curating this dataset, which includes selecting the most suitable detoxified versions of toxic sentences. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors introduce a **new Hindi parallel dataset** consisting of 500 aligned toxic and non-toxic sentences. This dataset is specifically designed for validation purposes and is mentioned in the context of enhancing multilingual resources for text detoxification.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **dataset by Dementieva et al. (2021)**, the citation is:
   > Daryna Dementieva, Varvara Logacheva, Irina Nikishina, Alena Fenogenova, David Dale, Irina Krotova, Nikita Semenov, Tatiana Shavrina, and Alexander Panchenko. *Crowdsourcing of parallel corpora: the case of style transfer for detoxification*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Crowd Science Workshop: Trust, Ethics, and Excellence in Crowdsourced Data Management at Scale co-located with 47th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB 2021), Copenhagen, Denmark, August 20, 2021, volume 2932 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings, pages 35–49. CEUR-WS.org.

2. For the **Hindi parallel dataset**, while the authors do not provide a separate citation for this dataset, it is derived from their own work and can be referenced as:
   > Sourabrata Mukherjee, Akanksha Bansal, Atul Kr. Ojha, John P. McCrae, and Ondřej Dušek. *Text Detoxification as Style Transfer in English and Hindi*. In Proceedings of the 16th International Natural Language Generation Conference, pages 388–395, Prague, Czechia. Association for Computational Linguistics.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
