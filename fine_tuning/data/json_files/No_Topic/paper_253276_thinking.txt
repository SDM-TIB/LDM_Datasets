To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wavelet Denoising and Attention-based RNN-ARIMA Model to Predict Forex Price" by Zhiwen Zeng and Matloob Khushi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **USD/JPY five-minute data**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors mention that they collected **75,000 records of the USDJPY currency pair from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31** from the MetaTrader5 platform. This provides a clear description of the dataset, including its size, the currency pair involved, and the time period covered.

I will also check the **related literature and references sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or cited. However, the primary dataset appears to be the USDJPY data, which is explicitly detailed in the experiments section.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from the MetaTrader5 platform, I will note that in the citation. The citation for the dataset will be:

> Zhiwen Zeng and Matloob Khushi. "Wavelet Denoising and Attention-based RNN-ARIMA Model to Predict Forex Price." *School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney*, 2019. Data collected from MetaTrader5 platform.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, the key dataset extracted from this paper is the **USDJPY five-minute data**, and I will ensure to document it accurately with the citation provided.
