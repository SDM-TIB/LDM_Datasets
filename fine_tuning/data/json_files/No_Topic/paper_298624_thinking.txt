To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Maximizing Mutual Information Across Feature and Topology Views for Learning Graph Representations" by Xiaolong Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two synthetic datasets and five real-world datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**:
   - **Feature Synthetic Dataset (FEA. SYN. DATA)**: This dataset consists of 2,400 nodes, with edges created based on a probability of 0.01. The features are generated from a Gaussian distribution.
   - **Topology Synthetic Dataset (TOP. SYN. DATA)**: This dataset also contains 2,400 nodes, divided into three communities, with different probabilities for edge creation within and between communities.

2. **Real-World Datasets**:
   - **CORA**: A citation network dataset containing sparse bag-of-words feature vectors for documents and citation links.
   - **CITESEER**: Similar to CORA, this dataset also consists of documents with features and citation links.
   - **PUBMED**: Another citation network dataset with document features and citation links.
   - **PUBMEDFULL**: An extended version of the PUBMED dataset.
   - **AMAZON COMPUTERS**: A dataset representing goods with edges indicating co-purchase relationships.
   - **AMAZON PHOTO**: Similar to AMAZON COMPUTERS, this dataset also represents goods with co-purchase relationships.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the synthetic datasets are generated by the authors and do not have external citations, I will focus on the real-world datasets:

- For **CORA**, **CITESEER**, and **PUBMED**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Cohen, W., & Salakhudinov, R. (2016). Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For **PUBMEDFULL**, the citation is:
  > Bojchevski, A., & G ¨unnemann, S. (2018). Deep Gaussian embedding of graphs: Unsupervised inductive learning via ranking. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations.

- For **AMAZON COMPUTERS** and **AMAZON PHOTO**, the citation is:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G ¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. In NeurIPS Workshop.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
