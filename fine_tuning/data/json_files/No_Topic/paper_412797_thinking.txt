To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Localization Is All You Evaluate: Data Leakage in Online Mapping Datasets and How to Fix It" by Adam Lilja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions two primary datasets: **nuScenes** and **Argoverse 2**, which are used for training and evaluating online mapping methods. This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research presented in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **related work** and **experiments** sections to gather more details about these datasets. In the related work section, the authors discuss the datasets used for online mapping, specifically highlighting the issues with geographical overlap in the original splits of nuScenes and Argoverse 2. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in the context of the paper.

In the **datasets section** (which is likely part of the experiments or methodology), I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sample sizes, and the specific issues related to data leakage. The paper provides a summary table (Table 1) that outlines the datasets, their purposes, and the number of samples in each set. 

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **nuScenes**: This dataset contains 1,000 driving sequences collected in Boston and Singapore, with a total of 40,000 key-frame samples. It is primarily used for object detection and online mapping tasks.

2. **Argoverse 2**: An extension of the original Argoverse dataset, it includes 1,000 annotated driving sequences from six U.S. cities, focusing on drivable areas and road boundaries.

Next, I will check the **references section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **nuScenes**:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A Multi-Modal Dataset for Autonomous Driving*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

- For **Argoverse 2**:
  > Benjamin Wilson, William Qi, Tanmay Agarwal, John Lambert, Jagjeet Singh, Siddhesh Khandelwal, Bowen Pan, Ratnesh Kumar, Andrew Hartnett, Jhony Kaesemodel Pontes, Deva Ramanan, Peter Carr, and James Hays. *Argoverse 2: Next Generation Datasets for Self-Driving Perception and Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks (NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks), 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
