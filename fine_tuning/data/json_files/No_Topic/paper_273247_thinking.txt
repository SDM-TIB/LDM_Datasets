To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Shadow Price via Lagrangian Multiplier for Nonsmooth Problem" by Yan Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss applications or examples** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the exploration of shadow pricing in nonsmooth situations and an application to electricity pricing, which may suggest the use of datasets related to energy economics.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of specific datasets or references to prior studies that may have utilized datasets. The introduction discusses the historical context of shadow pricing and its applications but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

I will then look into **section 5 (Pricing Mechanism Based on Social Welfare Maximization)**, which discusses an electric power system and mentions utility functions and cost functions. This section may provide insights into datasets used in the context of energy pricing. However, it does not specify any datasets directly.

Throughout the paper, I will also check the **references** section to see if any cited works include datasets or if they reference studies that utilized datasets. For instance, the paper cites works by Deng et al. (2015) and Lee and Zhou (2015), which may have associated datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile any identified datasets and ensure to include full citations for each dataset. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that the paper primarily discusses theoretical concepts without providing empirical datasets.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
