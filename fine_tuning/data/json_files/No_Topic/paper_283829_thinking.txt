To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Taylor Based Sampling Scheme for Machine Learning in Computational Physics" by Paul Novello et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of numerical simulations to generate data for training machine learning models, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of surrogate models and the importance of training data, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will need to look further into the methodology and results sections for specific dataset mentions.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to sampling data for training. They mention that the dataset is drawn from a numerical simulation software, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. I will need to check if they refer to any established datasets or if they are using a custom dataset generated from their simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors present their findings based on the application of their methodology to the Bateman Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system. They discuss the performance of their model but do not explicitly name any datasets used for training or testing.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to their methodology. The references include various works related to machine learning and computational physics, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several works that may involve datasets, but none are explicitly named as datasets used in this study. The authors primarily focus on their methodology and its application rather than on specific datasets.

Given that no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that the authors may have used custom datasets generated from their simulations rather than established datasets. Therefore, I will document this finding accordingly.

In summary, I will note that the paper discusses the use of numerical simulations for data generation but does not provide specific dataset names or citations. I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
