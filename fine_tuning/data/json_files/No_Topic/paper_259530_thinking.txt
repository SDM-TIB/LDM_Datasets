To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coherent Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification Networks" by Eleonora Giunchiglia and Thomas Lukasiewicz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their proposed method. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down for further investigation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their methodology and results. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used for training and testing their model. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of features, classes, and data points.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention **20 real-world datasets** commonly used for hierarchical multi-label classification. They provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists these datasets along with their respective characteristics. I will extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided in the table.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as the citations provide the necessary context and acknowledgment for the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

I will continue this process for all datasets listed in Table 1, ensuring that I accurately capture the full citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
