To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge and Identity Preserving Network for Face Super-Resolution" by Jonghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on two datasets: **CelebA** and **VGGFace2**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they specify:

1. **CelebA**: This dataset is described as a large-scale face dataset containing about 0.2 million images, with both aligned and unaligned face images. The authors mention using 162,770 aligned images for training and 19,962 for testing, as well as 135,516 unaligned images for training and 33,880 for testing.

2. **VGGFace2**: This dataset is referenced as a part of the evaluation, but the authors do not provide extensive details in this section. However, they mention that it contains images used for unaligned face images in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, X. Tang. *Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset*. Retrieved August 15, 2018.

- For **VGGFace2**, the citation is:
  > Q. Cao, L. Shen, W. Xie, O. M. Parkhi, A. Zisserman. *VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In Proceedings of the 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pages 67–74.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CelebA**: A large-scale face dataset with approximately 0.2 million images, used for training and testing.
   - Citation: Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, X. Tang. *Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset*. Retrieved August 15, 2018.

2. **VGGFace2**: A dataset used for recognizing faces across various poses and ages.
   - Citation: Q. Cao, L. Shen, W. Xie, O. M. Parkhi, A. Zisserman. *VGGFace2: A dataset for recognising faces across pose and age*. In Proceedings of the 2018 13th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2018), pages 67–74.

With this information, I am now ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing or review.
