To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-situ Stochastic Training of MTJ Crossbar based Neural Networks" by Ankit Mondal and Ankur Srivastava, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SONAR, Rocks vs Mines**: This dataset is used to train and evaluate neural networks with different architectures. The authors indicate that they tested on 104 samples of the test dataset.

2. **MNIST Digit Recognition**: This well-known dataset is used for training and evaluating three 2-layer networks with varying hidden units and a 3-layer network. The authors mention that they evaluated on 10,000 images of the test dataset.

3. **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) (WBCD)**: This dataset is used for training a single-layer network and two two-layer networks. The test dataset consists of 200 samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **SONAR, Rocks vs Mines dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman. 2013. UCI Machine Learning Repository. (2013). http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun et al. 1998. Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proc. IEEE 86, 11 (1998), 2278â€“2324.

- For the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman. 2013. UCI Machine Learning Repository. (2013). http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper referencing.
