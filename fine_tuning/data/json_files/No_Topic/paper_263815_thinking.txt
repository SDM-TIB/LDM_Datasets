To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NeuralFusion: Online Depth Fusion in Latent Space" by Silvan Weder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel depth map fusion approach and indicates that experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real-world data. This suggests that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **ShapeNet**: The authors state that they used the ShapeNet dataset for performance evaluation, selecting 13 classes for training and evaluating on a specific test set consisting of 60 objects from six classes.

2. **ModelNet**: The authors also mention using the ModelNet dataset, training and testing on 10 classes with a specific train-test split.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas A. Funkhouser, Leonidas J. Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qi-Xing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. CoRR, abs/1512.03012, 2015.

- For **ModelNet**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, CVPR 2015, Boston, MA, USA, June 7-12, 2015, pages 1912â€“1920. IEEE Computer Society, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. ShapeNet
2. ModelNet

I will ensure that the full citations for each dataset are included in the final output.
