To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TALC: Time-Aligned Captions for Multi-Scene Text-to-Video Generation" by Hritik Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (TALC: Time-Aligned Captions for Multi-Scene T2V Generation)**, where the authors discuss their method and may reference specific datasets used for training their model. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets used for creating the multi-scene video-text data.

In **section 3.2 (TALC Training)**, the authors describe their method for creating synthetic multi-scene video-text examples. They mention using existing datasets for this purpose, specifically citing **MSR-VTT** and **VaTeX** as sources of natural videos and associated captions. This is crucial information as it indicates the datasets they utilized.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
> Xin Wang, Jiawei Wu, Junkun Chen, Lei Li, Yuan-Fang Wang, and William Yang Wang. *Vatex: A large-scale, high-quality multilingual dataset for video-and-language research*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 4581â€“4591, 2019.

For **VaTeX**, the citation is:
> Wenyi Hong, Ming Ding, Wendi Zheng, Xinghan Liu, and Jie Tang. *Cogvideo: Large-scale pretraining for text-to-video generation via transformers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.15868, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
