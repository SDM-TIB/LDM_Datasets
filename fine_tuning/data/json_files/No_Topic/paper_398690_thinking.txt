To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Analysis of CPU and GPU Profiling for Deep Learning Models" by Dipesh Gyawali, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Pytorch for analyzing CPU and GPU resource allocations, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly looking for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the author mentions that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is being built using the Pytorch framework and that the dataset used is downloaded from Kaggle. The author specifies that there are a total of **8005 training sets and 2023 test sets of cat and dog images**.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its name or any specific characteristics. The author does not provide a specific name for the dataset but indicates that it is a cat and dog image classification dataset from Kaggle.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, since the dataset is sourced from Kaggle and not from a specific academic paper, I will need to provide a general citation for Kaggle datasets. The citation format for Kaggle datasets typically includes the dataset title and the URL where it can be accessed.

The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:
- **Dataset Title**: Dogs vs. Cats
- **Citation**: Kaggle. *Dogs vs. Cats Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify the specific dataset used.
3. Note the total number of training and test samples.
4. Look for the appropriate citation for the dataset from Kaggle.

With this information, I can now create a complete entry for the dataset used in the research paper.
