To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confirmatory Aspect-based Opinion Mining Processes" by Jongho Ima et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to customer reviews of restaurants in Hawaii obtained from TripAdvisor. This suggests that there is a dataset related to restaurant reviews.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the paper, the authors describe collecting **6,983 TripAdvisor reviews from 677 Hawaii restaurants**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used for their analysis.

I will also check the **empirical analysis** section, where the authors provide details about the dataset, including the columns it contains: restaurant name, overall rating, review title, customer review, and the date visited. This further confirms the dataset's relevance and structure.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset is derived from TripAdvisor reviews, and while the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, I can reference the source of the data collection:

- For the **TripAdvisor dataset**, the citation is:
  > TripAdvisor. *TripAdvisor Reviews*. Available at: https://www.tripadvisor.com (Accessed: [insert access date]).

Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the dataset in the references, I will use the general source of the data as the citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the dataset used in the research.
