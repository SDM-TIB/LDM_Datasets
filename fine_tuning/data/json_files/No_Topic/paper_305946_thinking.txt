To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-agnostic multi-objective approach for the evolutionary discovery of mathematical models" by Alexander Hvatov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 3 (Examples)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using a common dataset for all experiments, specifically the **time series of sea surface height** obtained from numerical simulations using the NEMO model for the Arctic Ocean. This indicates that there is a dataset that is central to their experiments.

I will also check the **experimental setup** subsection within section 3.1, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset covers one year with hourly time resolution, which is crucial for understanding its scope and application.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite the following work related to the dataset:

- For the **NEMO model** dataset, the citation is:
  > Hvatov, A., Nikitin, N.O., Kalyuzhnaya, A.V., Kosukhin, S.S. (2019). *Adaptation of nemolim3 model for multigrid high resolution arctic simulation*. Ocean Modelling, 141, 101427. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101427

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Sea Surface Height Time Series
   - **Description**: Time series data obtained from numerical simulations using the NEMO model for the Arctic Ocean, covering one year with hourly time resolution.
   - **Full Citation**: Hvatov, A., Nikitin, N.O., Kalyuzhnaya, A.V., Kosukhin, S.S. (2019). *Adaptation of nemolim3 model for multigrid high resolution arctic simulation*. Ocean Modelling, 141, 101427. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2019.101427

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
