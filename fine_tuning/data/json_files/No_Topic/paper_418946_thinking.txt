To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Global Glacier Mapping with Deep Learning and Open Earth Observation Data" by Konstantin A. Maslov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a benchmark dataset covering 9% of glaciers worldwide, which suggests that there is a significant dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they collected a large dataset combining publicly available optical, SAR, and DEM data for 11 regions worldwide. This section will likely provide specific details about the dataset, including its composition and the regions it covers.

In the **Table 2 (Dataset summary)**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the number of glaciers, glacier area, and references for each region. I will extract the following datasets from this table:

1. **European Alps (ALP)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for the Alps region.
   - Citation: Paul, F. et al. *Glacier shrinkage in the Alps continues unabated as revealed by a new glacier inventory from Sentinel-2*. Earth System Science Data 12, 1805–1821, 2020.

2. **Antarctica (ANT)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for Antarctica.
   - Citation: RGI Consortium. *Randolph Glacier Inventory—A Dataset of Global Glacier Outlines, Version 6*. Boulder, Colorado USA. NSIDC: National Snow and Ice Data Center, 2017.

3. **Alaska and Western America (AWA)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for Alaska and Western America.
   - Citation: GLIMS Consortium. *GLIMS Glacier Database, Version 1*. Boulder Colorado, USA. NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center, 2015.

4. **Caucasus (CAU)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for the Caucasus region.
   - Citation: Tielidze, L. G. & Wheate, R. D. *The Greater Caucasus Glacier Inventory (Russia, Georgia and Azerbaijan)*. Cryosphere 12, 81–94, 2018.

5. **Greenland (GRL)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for Greenland.

6. **High-Mountain Asia (HMA)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for High-Mountain Asia.
   - Citation: Racoviteanu, A. E. et al. *Challenges and recommendations in mapping of glacier parameters from space: results of the 2008 Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) workshop, Boulder, Colorado, USA*. Annals of Glaciology 50, 53–69, 2009.

7. **Low Latitudes (TRP)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for low latitude regions.
   - Citation: Carrivick, J. L. et al. *Ice thickness and volume changes across the Southern Alps, New Zealand, from the little ice age to present*. Scientific Reports 10, 1–10, 2020.

8. **New Zealand (NZL)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for New Zealand.
   - Citation: Carrivick, J. L. et al. *Ice thickness and volume changes across the Southern Alps, New Zealand, from the little ice age to present*. Scientific Reports 10, 1–10, 2020.

9. **Southern Andes (SAN)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for the Southern Andes.
   - Citation: Zemp, M. et al. *Global glacier mass changes and their contributions to sea-level rise from 1961 to 2016*. Nature 568, 382–386, 2019.

10. **Scandinavia (SCA)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for Scandinavia.
    - Citation: Huss, M. & Hock, R. *Global-scale hydrological response to future glacier mass loss*. Nature Climate Change 8, 135–140, 2018.

11. **Svalbard (SVAL)**: This dataset includes glacier outlines and relevant data for Svalbard.
    - Citation: Lith, A., Moholdt, G. & Kohler, J. *Svalbard glacier inventory based on Sentinel-2 imagery from summer 2020*. 2021.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
