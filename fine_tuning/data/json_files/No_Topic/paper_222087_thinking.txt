To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Data-Driven Automatic Video Editing" by Sergey Podlesnyy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset references.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the need for automatic video editing and mentions the use of "samples extracted from the content created by professional editors including the motion pictures masterpieces." This suggests that there are datasets derived from professional films, but I need to find specific names or references.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (System Overview)** and **section 4 (Components and Training)**, where the author describes the features extraction pipeline and the datasets used for training. In section 4.1, the author mentions using a dataset created from "detailed cinematography scripts of 72 episodes of various Russian TV series," which contains **566,000 frames**. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the author refers to using **DVD copies of 68 out of 100 best movies** by The American Society of Cinematographers as reference samples for training the editing model. This indicates another dataset, although it is not quantified in terms of the number of frames or clips.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The references may provide additional context or details about the datasets used in the research.

1. For the dataset derived from the **72 episodes of Russian TV series**, I will note that the specific citation for this dataset is not provided in the paper, but it is important to mention it as a significant dataset used for training.

2. For the **68 movies** referenced, I will cite the source as:
   > ASC Unveils List of 100 Milestone Films in Cinematography of the 20th Century. https://theasc.com/news/asc-unveils-list-of-100-milestone-films-in-cinematography-of-the-20th-century, 2019/01/08.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
