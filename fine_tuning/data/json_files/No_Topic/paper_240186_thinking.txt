To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds for Zero-Order Stochastic Gradient Estimation" by Abdulrahman Alabdulkareem and Jean Honorio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there may be a section that outlines the experiments conducted, which typically includes details about the datasets used. If such a section exists, I will carefully read it to extract the names and descriptions of the datasets.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the earlier sections, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. This is crucial because datasets are often introduced in the context of previous works, and their full citations can be found there.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations. For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "MNIST dataset," I will look for the original paper that introduced it and write down the complete citation.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset entry.
