To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From orders to prices: A stochastic description of the limit order book to forecast intraday returns" by Johannes Bleher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for empirical analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the data used in their analysis. Here, they mention that the data were provided by Deutsche Börse and consist of all recorded order book events from the XETRA system for trading of the 30 stocks in the DAX index between January 2 and March 26, 2004. This section is crucial as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In this section, the authors also mention the total number of events recorded (228,275,832) and the initial positions available at the beginning of the period (2,282). This information is essential for understanding the scale and scope of the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

The key datasets identified in the paper are:

1. **XETRA Order Book Data**: This dataset includes all recorded order book events for the 30 stocks in the DAX index from January 2 to March 26, 2004. It consists of order arrivals, cancellations, and other relevant events.

   Citation:
   > Deutsche Börse. *XETRA Order Book Data*, 2004.

2. **Initial Positions Data**: This dataset includes the open order positions in the XETRA system as of January 1, 2004, at 12 PM.

   Citation:
   > Deutsche Börse. *Initial Positions Data*, January 1, 2004.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets, their descriptions, and citations for further reference.
