To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic-based Watermarks for LLM-Generated Text" by Alexander Nemecek, Yuzhou Jiang, and Erman Ayday, I will follow a systematic approach to identify any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses watermarking algorithms and their limitations but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of watermarking without citing specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background** and **related work** sections, as these often contain references to datasets used in previous studies. In these sections, the authors discuss various watermarking algorithms and their applications but do not provide specific datasets.

I will then look into the **proposed method** and **experiments** sections, as these typically detail the methodologies and any datasets used for evaluation. However, upon reviewing these sections, it appears that the paper does not utilize any specific datasets for experiments; instead, it focuses on theoretical frameworks and algorithms.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references primarily consist of papers discussing watermarking techniques and LLMs, but they do not mention specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention or utilize any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, I have thoroughly searched the paper for any datasets, but it appears that the focus is on theoretical contributions rather than empirical evaluations involving specific datasets. Thus, there are no datasets to extract or cite from this paper.
