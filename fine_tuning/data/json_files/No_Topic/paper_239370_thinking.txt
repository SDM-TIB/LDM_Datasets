To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Neuron to Fool Them All" by Anshuman Suri and David Evans, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the research. I will take note of these datasets as potential candidates for extraction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to confirm the use of these datasets and gather any additional details. In this section, the authors discuss their experiments and provide results related to the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. This reinforces that these datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets used in the research.
