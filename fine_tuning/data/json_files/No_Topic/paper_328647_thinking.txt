To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Accelerated (Extra-)Gradient Methods with Variance Reduction" by Zijian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their algorithms' performance on "real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors may describe the context of their work and reference datasets that are commonly used in the field. If they mention any datasets by name, I will take note of them.

I will then examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for testing their algorithms. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics (e.g., size, type, and any relevant statistics).

If the paper includes a **datasets section** (which is common), I will focus on that section to find explicit descriptions of the datasets used. I will note down the names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention the "LIBSVM datasets" in the experiments, I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. *LIBSVM: A Library for Support Vector Machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2(3):1â€“27, 2011.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness.
