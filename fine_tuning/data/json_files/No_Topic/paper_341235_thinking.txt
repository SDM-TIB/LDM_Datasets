To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fatigue Prediction in Outdoor Running Conditions using Audio Data" by Andreas Triantafyllopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on predicting fatigue using audio data, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **Section III (Dataset)**, where the authors introduce the KIRun dataset. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. The KIRun dataset consists of 48 runners and includes various data modalities collected during outdoor running sessions. The authors mention that the dataset comprises 185 running sessions, each approximately 45 minutes long, and that it includes audio signals, heart rate data, and biomechanical sensor data.

I will note the key details about the KIRun dataset:
- **KIRun Dataset**: A dataset of 48 runners collected in outdoor conditions, comprising 185 running sessions with audio, heart rate, and biomechanical data.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the KIRun dataset in the **References section**. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for the KIRun dataset, as it appears to be a newly introduced dataset by the authors themselves. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the authors and the title of the paper:

- For the **KIRun Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Triantafyllopoulos, Sandra Ottl, Alexander Gebhard, Esther Rituerto-González, Mirko Jaumann, Steffen Hüttner, Valerie Dieter, Patrick Schneeweiß, Inga Krauß, Maurice Gerczuk, Shahin Amiriparian, and Björn W. Schuller. *Fatigue Prediction in Outdoor Running Conditions using Audio Data*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the KIRun dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
