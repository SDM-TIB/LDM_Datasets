To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Orbital-free Bond Breaking via Machine Learning" by John C. Snyder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or data sources used in the research. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets that the authors might reference. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets that are foundational to the study.

Then, I will examine the **methodology section** closely, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets used for training or validation. In this paper, the authors discuss using machine learning to approximate kinetic energy functionals, which may involve specific datasets related to molecular structures or energies.

After that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors mention any datasets in the context of their findings or performance evaluations. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized and their relevance to the study's conclusions.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. It is crucial to ensure that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset, as this will be important for proper attribution and further research.

Based on my reading, I will identify the datasets used in the study. For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for training their machine learning model, I will note its name and description. I will also look for any relevant papers that describe these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.
