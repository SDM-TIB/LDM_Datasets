To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Machine Learning Enhances Disease Prognosis: Applications on COVID-19 and Onward" by Jinzhi Shen and Ke Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of interpretable machine learning techniques in predicting the prognosis of respiratory diseases, particularly COVID-19, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **overview of the problem setup** and **clinical knowledge-informed model design** sections. These sections may provide insights into the types of data used, such as electronic health records (EHR), clinical features, and other relevant datasets.

In the **table of interpretable machine learning methods developed for COVID-19 prognosis**, I will look for specific datasets mentioned alongside the models. The table lists various models, their input clinical features, and performance metrics, which may indicate the datasets used for training and validation.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for each dataset.

From the table, I can identify several datasets used in the studies referenced:

1. **Mortality Risk Dataset**: This dataset includes clinical features such as LDH, CRP, and age, used in models like RF and XGBoost. The performance metrics indicate it was evaluated on a cohort of 205 patients.

2. **SVM Mortality Risk Dataset**: This dataset includes features like CRP, BUN, serum calcium, and albumin, evaluated on 398 patients with reported AUROC and AUPRC metrics.

3. **Bayesian Networks Dataset**: This dataset predicts mortality risk based on hospital stay duration, ICU admission, and death records, evaluated on 1,645 patients.

4. **Factor Graph Dataset**: This dataset predicts ICU admission based on comorbidities, laboratory tests, and vital signs, evaluated on 533 patients.

5. **CT Image Features Dataset**: This dataset analyzes CT image features to predict disease aggravation, evaluated on 188 patients.

Next, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section. For example:

- For the **Mortality Risk Dataset** using RF and XGBoost, I will find the original study that introduced this dataset and cite it accordingly.
- For the **SVM Mortality Risk Dataset**, I will locate the study by Booth et al. that reported the AUROC and AUPRC metrics.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including the number of patients involved and the clinical features used.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.
