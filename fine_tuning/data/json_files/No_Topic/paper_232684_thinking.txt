To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BIONET: INFUSING BIOMARKER PRIOR INTO GLOBAL-TO-LOCAL NETWORK FOR CHOROID SEGMENTATION IN OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY IMAGES" by Huihong Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a dataset named **AROD**, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the AROD dataset. They describe it as containing **256 × 20 B-scans** covering a **6×6 mm² region** and a depth of **2 mm**. They also mention that **1280 B-scan images** were used for training and testing, which confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AROD dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Cheng et al. for the dataset, which is crucial for providing the complete citation.

The citation for the AROD dataset is:
> Cheng, J., Tao, D., Quan, Y., Wong, D. W., Cheung, G. C., Akiba, M., & Liu, J. (2016). *Speckle reduction in 3D optical coherence tomography of retina by a-scan reconstruction*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 35(10), 2270-2279.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, I have identified the AROD dataset as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have gathered its details and citation for further processing.
