To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Tensor Latent Features" by Sung-En Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **three synthetic datasets** (Syn0, Syn1, Syn2) and **three real-world datasets** (Indian Pines, Jasper Ridge, and Samson1). I will take note of these datasets and their characteristics.

For the **synthetic datasets**, the authors describe how they were generated, including the dimensions and the number of atoms used. I will summarize this information clearly.

For the **real-world datasets**, I will look for specific details provided in the experiments section, such as the source, dimensions, and any relevant characteristics. The authors mention that the Indian Pines dataset consists of 145 × 145 pixels and 224 spectral reflectance bands, Jasper Ridge has 512 × 614 pixels with 224 channels, and Samson1 has 952 × 952 pixels with 156 channels.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
