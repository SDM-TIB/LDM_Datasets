To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Retrieval with Hierarchical Matching Pursuit" by Shasha Bu and Yu-Jin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on the **Holidays dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges in image retrieval and mention the use of the Holidays dataset for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their work.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors provide detailed information about their methodology and results. They specifically mention that they conducted experiments on the Holidays dataset, which contains 1,491 color images and 500 queries. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its use.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Holidays dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For the **Holidays dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Jegou, M. Douze, and C. Schmid. *Hamming embedding and weak geometric consistency for large scale image search*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2008, pp. 304–317. Springer, 2008.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details and its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the dataset used in the research.
