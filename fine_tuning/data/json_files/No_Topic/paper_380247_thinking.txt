To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Perception-Driven Image Compression: A Layered Generative Approach" by Yuefeng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a specific dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using the **CelebAMask-HQ dataset** for their experiments. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its size, content, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a description of the CelebAMask-HQ dataset, stating that it contains 30,000 high-resolution facial images with pixel-level labels for 19 semantic classes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebAMask-HQ dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lee, C.-H., Liu, Z., Wu, L., & Luo, P. (2020). MaskGAN: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
