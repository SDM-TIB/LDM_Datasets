To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Travelling waves in a coarse-grained model of volume-filling cell invasion: Simulations and comparisons" by Rebecca M. Crossley et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets used in their research. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

In the **methods section**, I will look for descriptions of the simulations and comparisons made in the study. This section often contains information about the datasets used for validation or comparison purposes. If the authors describe any datasets in detail, I will extract that information.

I will also check the **results section** for any figures or tables that might summarize data from specific datasets. If the authors present results based on particular datasets, I will note those datasets and any relevant statistics or findings associated with them.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Now, I will proceed with this structured approach to extract the datasets from the paper.
