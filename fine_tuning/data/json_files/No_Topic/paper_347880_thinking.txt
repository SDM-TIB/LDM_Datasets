To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the scaling of avalanche shape and activity power spectrum in neuronal networks" by Manoj Kumar Nandi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the scaling behavior of neuronal avalanches and mentions that the study involves a numerical model of integrate-and-fire neurons, which may imply the use of specific datasets or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **results** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss data collection or analysis. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including any numerical simulations or experimental data that the authors may have used to validate their findings.

In the **results** section, I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that may summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. If the authors refer to datasets used in their numerical simulations or experimental setups, I will note these down.

I will also check the **discussion** section for any references to datasets that may have been used in previous studies or comparisons made with existing datasets in the literature.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This may include original datasets or studies that provided data for comparison.

Based on my reading, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include:

1. The name of each dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
3. The full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset for neuronal activity, I will ensure to capture its name, describe its relevance to the study, and provide the complete citation.

After gathering all this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
