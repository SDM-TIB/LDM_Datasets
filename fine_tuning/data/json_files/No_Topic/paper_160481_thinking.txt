To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral clustering algorithms for the detection of clusters in block-cyclic and block-acyclic graphs" by Hadrien Van Lierde and Tommy W. S. Chow, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the algorithms are applied to a trophic network and a worldwide network of Autonomous Systems, indicating that these are potential datasets.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the application of their algorithms to real-world networks, specifically mentioning a trophic network based on predator-prey relationships and a network of Autonomous Systems. This suggests that these networks are the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe the trophic network as consisting of 128 species or agents, and they reference a dataset from the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis for the Autonomous Systems network, which includes 45,427 ISPs and 230,194 connections.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**:

1. For the **trophic network dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ulanowicz, R. E., & DeAngelis, D. L. (2005). Network analysis of trophic dynamics in south Florida ecosystems. US Geological Survey Program on the South Florida Ecosystem, 114.

2. For the **Autonomous Systems dataset**, the citation is:
   > Luckie, M., Huffaker, B., Dhamdhere, A., Giotsas, V., et al. (2013). As relationships, customer cones, and validation. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on Internet measurement conference (pp. 243â€“256). ACM.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
