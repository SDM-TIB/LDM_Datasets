To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synchronized Pivots, A New Way of Engineering Optimized Fc Antibody Fragments" by J. C. Phillips, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses thermodynamic profiles and hydropathicity scales, but does not directly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the text**, particularly sections that discuss experimental results or methodologies. I will pay close attention to any references to specific datasets, such as amino acid sequences or structural data related to antibodies.

In the text, the author refers to various proteins and their sequences, including mentions of specific proteins like IgG1 and IgG4, as well as UBA1. However, there are no explicit datasets listed in a dedicated section like "Datasets" or "Materials and Methods." Instead, the author discusses the use of data from sources like DrugBank and the PDB (Protein Data Bank), which suggests that these databases are the underlying sources of the data used in the research.

I will now check the **References section** to find full citations for the databases or datasets mentioned. The paper references several studies and databases, but I need to ensure I capture the relevant citations for the datasets used in the analysis.

1. **DrugBank**: This is a comprehensive resource for drug and drug target information, which includes amino acid sequences and other relevant data for various drugs. The citation for DrugBank is:
   > Wishart, D. S., Feunang, Y. D., Marcu, A., et al. (2018). *DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018*. Nucleic Acids Research, 46(D1), D1074-D1082.

2. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: This database contains 3D structural data of proteins and nucleic acids. The citation for PDB is:
   > Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., et al. (2000). *The Protein Data Bank*. Nucleic Acids Research, 28(1), 235-242.

3. **Uniprot**: This is a comprehensive protein sequence and functional information database. The citation for Uniprot is:
   > The UniProt Consortium. (2019). *UniProt: a worldwide hub of protein knowledge*. Nucleic Acids Research, 47(D1), D506-D515.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- DrugBank
- Protein Data Bank (PDB)
- Uniprot

Each dataset will be accompanied by its full citation to ensure proper attribution and reference for future research or analysis.
