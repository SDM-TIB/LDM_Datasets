To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROBIN: a Graph-Theoretic Approach to Reject Outliers in Robust Estimation using Invariants" by J. Shi, H. Yang, and L. Carlone, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors mention evaluating ROBIN on four geometric perception problems, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

In the experiments section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets. For example, the authors mention using the **3DMatch dataset** for evaluating their method, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the **3DMatch dataset**, I will look for the original paper that introduced it to ensure I have the correct citation.

The citation for the **3DMatch dataset** is:
> A. Zeng, S. Song, M. Nie√üner, M. Fisher, J. Xiao, and T. Funkhouser. *3DMatch: Learning the Matching of Local 3D Geometry in Range Scans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, volume 1, page 4, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
