To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDA-GAN: Unsupervised Image Translation Using Spectral Domain Attention-Guided Generative Adversarial Network" by Qizhou Wang and Maksim Makarenko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel GAN architecture for image translation but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section** (Section 4), where the authors compare their proposed method with a baseline model. Here, they mention that they trained the proposed SDA-GAN on a variety of datasets, specifically highlighting the following:

1. **Horse2Zebra Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for unpaired image-to-image translation tasks, particularly for translating images of horses to images of zebras.

2. **Apple2Orange Dataset**: Another dataset used for image-to-image translation, focusing on translating images of apples to images of oranges.

3. **Face2Comic Dataset**: This dataset is used for translating human face images to comic-style images.

4. **Monet2Photo Dataset**: This dataset is used for translating images of Monet paintings to photographs.

In the experimental analysis, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets mentioned are commonly known in the research community, and their original papers or sources can be cited as follows:

- For the **Horse2Zebra Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., & Efros, A. A. (2017). Unpaired image-to-image translation using cycle-consistent adversarial networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2223â€“2232.

- For the **Apple2Orange Dataset**, this dataset is part of the same work as the Horse2Zebra dataset and can be cited similarly.

- For the **Face2Comic Dataset**, there is no specific citation provided in the paper, but it is often referenced in the context of style transfer tasks.

- For the **Monet2Photo Dataset**, this dataset is also part of the work by Zhu et al. (2017) and can be cited in the same manner.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
