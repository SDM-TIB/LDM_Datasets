To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TI-Face: Improving Facial Reconstruction through Tensorial Radiance Fields and Implicit Surfaces" by Ruijie Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the "View Synthesis Challenge for Human Heads (VSCHH)" and mentions a public dataset, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of reconstructing 3D objects and mention a novel challenge evaluated on a new public dataset. The reference to the "ILSH dataset" is crucial, as it is likely the primary dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on the **ILSH dataset** and provide results comparing their method against others. This confirms that the ILSH dataset is indeed utilized for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSH dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ILSH Dataset**: 
  > Jiali Zheng, Youngkyoon Jang, Athanasios Papaioannou, Christos Kampouris, Rolandos Alexandros Potamias, Foivos Paraperas Papantoniou, Efstathios Galanakis, Aleš Leonardis, and Stefanos Zafeiriou. *ILSH: The Imperial Light-Stage Head Dataset for Human Head View Synthesis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) Workshops, pages 1112–1120, October 2023.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the ILSH dataset is the only dataset referenced in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the ILSH dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be structured according to the specified format for downstream processing.
