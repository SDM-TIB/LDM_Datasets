To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Communities in Heterogeneous Multi-Relational Networks: A Message Passing based Approach" by Maoying Qiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on both synthetic and real-world networks, specifically referencing the **DBLP** and **Delicious-2K** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation in detail:

1. **DBLP Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the digital bibliography and library project, which includes bibliographic records from major computer science journals and proceedings. The authors specify that the dataset contains multi-typed objects such as authors and papers, along with their relationships.

2. **Delicious-2K Dataset**: This dataset consists of social bookmarking data, including users and their friendship connections, as well as URLs and their relationships.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For the **DBLP dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Deng, J. Han, B. Zhao, Y. Yu, and C. X. Lin. "Probabilistic topic models with biased propagation on heterogeneous information networks." In Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD), 2011, pp. 1271–1279.

- For the **Delicious-2K dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Cantador, P. Brusilovsky, and T. Kuﬂik. "2nd workshop on information heterogeneity and fusion in recommender systems (hetrec 2011)." In Proceedings of the 5th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, ser. RecSys 2011. New York, NY, USA: ACM, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
