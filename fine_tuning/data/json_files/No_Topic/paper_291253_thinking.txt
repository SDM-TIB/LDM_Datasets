To extract datasets from the technical report titled "SimpleSBML: A Python package for creating, editing, and interrogating SBML models: Version 2.0" by Herbert M. Sauro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and supplementary information sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the SimpleSBML package but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the introduction and methods.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the functionality of SimpleSBML and its relation to SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language), but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned. 

Next, I will examine the **methods section**. Here, the author describes the capabilities of the SimpleSBML package, including how to create and manipulate SBML models. However, there are no datasets explicitly referenced in this section either.

I will also check the **testing and documentation section** for any references to datasets used for testing the SimpleSBML package. The author mentions using a simple testing framework but does not provide any specific datasets.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the research or examples provided. The references include various papers related to SBML and its applications, but they do not specifically mention datasets used in the context of SimpleSBML.

After thoroughly reviewing the document, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in this technical report. The focus is primarily on the software package and its functionalities rather than on empirical datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings and note that the report does not include specific datasets for extraction.
