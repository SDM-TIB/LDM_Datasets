To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Powerful Are Randomly Initialized Pointcloud Set Functions?" by Aditya Sanghi and Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of pointclouds and neural networks, which might hint at specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets explicitly:

1. **MNIST-PC**: This is a pointcloud version of the MNIST dataset, generated by sampling points from the white pixels of the MNIST images. The authors state that they used 512 points in their experiments.

2. **ModelNet40**: This is a well-known dataset for 3D shape classification, consisting of 40 categories of 3D models.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **results and discussion sections** to confirm their usage and any specific characteristics mentioned by the authors.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Charles Ruizhongtai Qi, Hao Su, Kaichun Mo, and Leonidas J. Guibas. *PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 77â€“85, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
