To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pragmatic auditing: a pilot-driven approach for auditing Machine Learning systems" by Djalel Benbouzid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on auditing ML systems, but it may not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Conducting the Pilots)**, as this section describes two specific use cases that may involve datasets. The first pilot focuses on an AI-assisted calibration system, and the second pilot involves a vision system in a Geriatronics project. I will look for any references to datasets used in these pilots.

In the first pilot, the authors mention that the system relies on "historical knowledge accumulated by the domain experts," but they do not specify a formal dataset. I will note this as a qualitative source of data rather than a structured dataset.

In the second pilot, the authors describe the GARMI project, which involves capturing data from elderly patients, including facial expressions and skeleton data. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference. I will document this as well, noting that it involves data collection but lacks a formal dataset citation.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited that may have been used in the pilots or mentioned elsewhere in the paper. I will look for any papers or resources that describe datasets relevant to the topics discussed.

If I find any datasets mentioned in the references, I will extract their full citations. If no formal datasets are identified, I will summarize the qualitative data sources mentioned in the pilots.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset or data source is clearly described, along with its citation if applicable. If no formal datasets are found, I will note that the paper primarily discusses qualitative data sources without specific dataset references.
