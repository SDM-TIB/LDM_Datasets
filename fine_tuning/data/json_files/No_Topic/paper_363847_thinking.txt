To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Conditioned Spatial Relation Reasoning for 3D Object Grounding" by Shizhe Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Nr3D Dataset**: This dataset contains 37,842 human-written sentences referring to annotated objects in the 3D indoor scene dataset ScanNet. It includes 641 scenes, with specific splits for training and validation.

2. **Sr3D Dataset**: Constructed using templates to automatically generate sentences, this dataset has 1,018 training scenes and 255 validation scenes from ScanNet, totaling 83,570 sentences.

3. **ScanRefer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 51,583 human-written sentences for 800 scenes in ScanNet, with specified training and validation splits.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Nr3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panos Achlioptas, Ahmed Abdelreheem, Fei Xia, Mohamed Elhoseiny, and Leonidas Guibas. *Referit3D: Neural listeners for fine-grained 3D object identification in real-world scenes*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 422–440, 2020.

- For the **Sr3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panos Achlioptas, Ahmed Abdelreheem, Fei Xia, Mohamed Elhoseiny, and Leonidas Guibas. *Referit3D: Neural listeners for fine-grained 3D object identification in real-world scenes*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 422–440, 2020.

- For the **ScanRefer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dave Zhenyu Chen, Angel X Chang, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanRefer: 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 202–221, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
