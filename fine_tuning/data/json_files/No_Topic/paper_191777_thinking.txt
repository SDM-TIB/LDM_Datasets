To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Authorship recognition via fluctuation analysis of network topology and word intermittency" by Diego R. Amancio, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on analyzing stylistic patterns in texts, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the application of complex networks in textual analysis and mentions the relevance of stylistic fluctuations. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the part where the author describes the authorship recognition task. Here, the author states that the experiments were conducted on a dataset comprising books written by 8 authors, which is a crucial piece of information. I will look for any supplementary materials or tables that provide more details about this dataset.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of various classifiers and mentions the dataset again, confirming its importance in the analysis. The author also refers to a table (Table S1) in the supplementary information that lists the authors and their works, which is essential for identifying the dataset.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. If the dataset is derived from previously published works, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Based on my findings, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Dataset of Books for Authorship Recognition**: This dataset includes books written by 8 authors, which were analyzed for stylistic patterns and authorship recognition. The specific titles and authors will be extracted from Table S1 in the supplementary information.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset, which may include the original publications of the books or any relevant studies that have used these texts in authorship analysis.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its full citation, ready for inclusion in the structured output.
