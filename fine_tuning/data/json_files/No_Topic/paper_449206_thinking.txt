To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fintech and MSEs Innovation: an Empirical Analysis" by Siyu Chen and Qing Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I accurately identify and cite each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data source sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract mentions the **China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey (CMES)** and the **Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)**, indicating that these are key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data Source)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey (CMES)**: This dataset is provided by the Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance of Southwest University of Finance and Economics. It includes a nationwide large-scale sample survey of MSEs conducted in 2015, covering over 5400 MSEs across 28 provinces in China.

2. **Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)**: This index is produced by a research team from the Institute of Digital Finance at Peking University and Ant Financial Services Group. It compiles micro data on fintech and aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the development of fintech in China.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey (CMES)**, the citation is:
  > Survey and Research Center for China Household Finance, Southwest University of Finance and Economics. *China Micro and Small Enterprise Survey (CMES) 2015*.

- For the **Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)**, the citation is:
  > Digital Finance Research Center, Peking University, and Ant Financial Services Group. *Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the descriptions.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
