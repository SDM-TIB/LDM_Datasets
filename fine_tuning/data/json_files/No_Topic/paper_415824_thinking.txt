To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering from Sure to Uncertain: Uncertainty-Aware Curriculum Learning for Video Question Answering" by Haopeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where datasets are typically detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their methods on **four datasets**: **TGIF-QA**, **NExT-QA**, **MSVD-QA**, and **MSRVTT-QA**. I will note down these names as they are crucial for the dataset extraction.

Next, I will look for any specific details about each dataset, such as their characteristics, sizes, and the tasks they are used for. The authors describe **TGIF-QA** as consisting of four sub-tasks: Count, FrameQA, Action, and Transition. **NExT-QA** is mentioned as a multi-choice dataset encompassing description, chronology, and causality. **MSVD-QA** and **MSRVTT-QA** are described as open-ended VideoQA datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

3. **MSVD-QA** citation:

4. **MSRVTT-QA** citation:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
