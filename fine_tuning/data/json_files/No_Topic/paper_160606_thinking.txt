To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sketch-a-Classiﬁer: Sketch-based Photo Classiﬁer Generation" by Conghui Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of sketches to synthesize photo classifiers, which suggests that datasets related to sketches and photos are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they state that they utilize the **Sketchy dataset** and provide details about it:

1. **Sketchy Dataset**: The paper indicates that this dataset contains approximately 75,000 sketches and 12,500 photos across 125 categories, along with an additional 56,166 ImageNet photos corresponding to the categories in Sketchy. This dataset is crucial for evaluating their proposed method.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Sketchy dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **Sketchy Dataset**:
  > P. Sangkloy, N. Burnell, C. Ham, and J. Hays. *The Sketchy Database: Learning to Retrieve Badly Drawn Bunnies*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2016.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference **ImageNet** as a source of additional photos for their experiments. I will include this dataset as well:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
