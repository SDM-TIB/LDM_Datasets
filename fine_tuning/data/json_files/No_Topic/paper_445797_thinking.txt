To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POLAFFINI: Efficient feature-based polyaffine initialization for improved non-linear image registration" by Antoine Legouhy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental design)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using T1-weighted images from three databases:

1. **ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**: This dataset includes a cohort of elderly subjects divided into cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer’s disease groups.

2. **IXI dataset**: This dataset consists of adult healthy subjects aged 20 years and older.

3. **UK Biobank**: A large database of subjects from the UK, aged between 40 and 69 years.

The paper also provides specific details about the voxel size and the reference for registration, which is an MNI template.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ADNI**, the citation is:
  > Petersen, R.C., Aisen, P.S., Beckett, L.A., Donohue, M.C., Gamst, A.C., Harvey, D.J., Jack, C.R., Jr, Jagust, W.J., Shaw, L.M., Toga, A.W., Trojanowski, J.Q., Weiner, M.W. *Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): clinical characterization*. Neurology, 74(3), 201–209 (2010).

- For **IXI dataset**, the citation is:
  > IXI dataset. *Brain Development*. Available at: [brain-development.org/ixi-dataset](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset).

- For **UK Biobank**, the citation is:
  > UK Biobank. *UK Biobank*. Available at: [ukbiobank.ac.uk](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
