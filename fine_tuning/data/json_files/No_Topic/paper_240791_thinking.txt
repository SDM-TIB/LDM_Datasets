To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimistic Agent: Accurate Graph-Based Value Estimation for More Successful Visual Navigation" by Mahdi Kazemi Moghaddam et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a neural graph and mentions empirical studies, which may indicate the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find explicit mentions of datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and may provide details about the datasets they utilized.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **AI2THOR environment** for their experiments. This is a significant clue that I need to document as a dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AI2THOR dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Eric Kolve, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Winson Han, Eli VanderBilt, Luca Weihs, Alvaro Herrasti, Daniel Gordon, Yuke Zhu, Abhinav Gupta, and Ali Farhadi. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Visual Genome dataset** for pre-training their prior knowledge graph. I will also look for its citation in the References section:
> Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, and et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, Feb 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **AI2THOR**: 
   - Citation: Eric Kolve, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Winson Han, Eli VanderBilt, Luca Weihs, Alvaro Herrasti, Daniel Gordon, Yuke Zhu, Abhinav Gupta, and Ali Farhadi. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. 2017.

2. **Visual Genome**: 
   - Citation: Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalandidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, and et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, Feb 2017.

With this information, I am ready to create the necessary structured output for the datasets.
