To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tables to LaTeX: Structure and Content Extraction from Scientific Tables" by Pratik Kayal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of extracting tabular information from scientific documents and refer to existing datasets for table detection and recognition. This indicates that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets they created and used for their experiments. They mention a new dataset called **Tab-To-Tex**, which is specifically designed for the task of generating LaTeX code from table images. The authors describe how they created this dataset by extracting table snippets from papers on ArXiv and converting them into images.

The paper also references other datasets in the context of related work and comparisons. Specifically, they mention the **PubTabNet** dataset, which is used as an adversarial case study for evaluating their model. 

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets along with their descriptions:

1. **Tab-To-Tex Dataset**: This dataset was created by the authors and consists of table images generated from LaTeX code extracted from scientific papers on ArXiv. The dataset is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License and is available for download at https://tinyurl.com/ydbw9asp.

2. **PubTabNet Dataset**: This dataset contains tables extracted from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. It is used to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model against tables from a different domain.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that the information is accurately documented and formatted according to the requirements for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in efficiently extracting and presenting the datasets from the research paper.
