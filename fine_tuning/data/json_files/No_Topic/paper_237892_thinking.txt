To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dimensionality reduction to maximize prediction generalization capability" by Takuya Isomura and Taro Toyoizumi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors discuss the performance of their method using sequential visual inputs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using specific datasets, which are likely to be detailed in the results or methods sections. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits. It is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **ALOI Dataset**: The Amsterdam Library of Object Images (ALOI) is a dataset that contains images of various objects, which can be used for object recognition tasks. The authors reference this dataset in the context of their experiments with 3D objects.

3. **BDD100K Dataset**: This dataset is a diverse driving video database that includes various driving scenarios and is used for tasks such as object detection and segmentation in autonomous driving contexts.

Next, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
