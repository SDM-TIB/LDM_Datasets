To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Fine-Grained Reasoning for Fake News Detection" by Yiqiao Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of detecting fake news and reference previous works that utilized datasets for this purpose. However, I need to find the specific datasets they used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two benchmark datasets: **PolitiFact** and **GossipCop**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their sizes and the nature of the data they contain.

The paper states that the **PolitiFact dataset** contains 815 news articles, with 443 labeled as true and 372 as fake. The **GossipCop dataset** contains 7,612 news articles, with 4,219 labeled as true and 3,393 as fake. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the **Fakenewsnet** repository, which is a data repository that includes both datasets. The citation for this repository is:

> Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., & Liu, H. (2020). Fakenewsnet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media. *Big Data*, 8(3), 171-188.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries. I will ensure that each dataset is described clearly, including its name, size, and the citation for the source where it can be found.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **PolitiFact Dataset**: Contains 815 news articles (443 true, 372 fake).
   - Citation: Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., & Liu, H. (2020). Fakenewsnet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media. *Big Data*, 8(3), 171-188.

2. **GossipCop Dataset**: Contains 7,612 news articles (4,219 true, 3,393 fake).
   - Citation: Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., & Liu, H. (2020). Fakenewsnet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media. *Big Data*, 8(3), 171-188.

After gathering all this information, I will format it according to the required structure for further processing.
