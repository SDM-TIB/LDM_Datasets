To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Optimal Antenna Tilt Control Policies: A Contextual Linear Bandit Approach" by Filippo Vannella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses algorithms for learning optimal tilt control policies but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain information about the datasets used for training and testing their algorithms. 

In the experiments section, the authors mention using a **network simulator** to run their experiments, which implies that they are using simulated data rather than a publicly available dataset. They describe the parameters of the simulation environment, including the number of base stations, sectors, and users, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets or provide a citation for a dataset, I will note that the data used in the experiments is generated from a proprietary simulator and does not have a formal citation. 

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of previous work or related studies. However, it appears that the references primarily cite other research papers and do not provide specific datasets.

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset**: No specific datasets were mentioned or cited in the paper. The experiments were conducted using data generated from a proprietary network simulator.

Since there are no formal datasets to cite, I will ensure to clearly state that the data is simulated and does not have a citation. This will be important for clarity in any future references to the data used in the experiments.
