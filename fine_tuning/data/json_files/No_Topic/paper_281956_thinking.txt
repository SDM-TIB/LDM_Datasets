To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical Blind Membership Inference Attack via Differential Comparisons" by Bo Hui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **Section IV (Datasets, Prior Attacks and Implementation)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. Here, I will look for a table or a list that outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details.

In **Table V**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their evaluation. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **UCI Adult Dataset**: This dataset contains census income records and is used to predict whether a person earns over $50,000 per year based on various attributes.

2. **EyePACS Dataset**: This dataset consists of retina images used for diabetic retinopathy detection, with labels indicating the severity of the condition.

3. **CH-MNIST Dataset**: A benchmark dataset of histological images of colorectal cancer, which includes multiple classes of tissue types.

4. **Location Dataset**: This dataset contains mobile users' location check-in records from the Foursquare social network.

5. **Purchase-50 Dataset**: This dataset includes purchase histories of shoppers, clustered into different classes representing various purchase habits.

6. **Texas Hospital Stays Dataset**: This dataset contains inpatient stay records from health facilities in Texas.

7. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: A well-known dataset for image recognition tasks, containing images across 100 classes.

8. **Birds-200 Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of various bird species, used for object recognition tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **UCI Adult Dataset** is:
> D. D. Dua and C. E. Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2019.

For the **EyePACS Dataset**, the citation is:
> P. M. Burlina et al. *Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Challenge*. Kaggle, 2018.

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
