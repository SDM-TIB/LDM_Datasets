To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ECPC-IDS: A benchmark endometrial cancer PET/CT image dataset for evaluation of semantic segmentation and detection of hypermetabolic regions" by Dechao Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors have published a publicly available dataset called **ECPC-IDS**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction elaborates on the significance of the dataset and confirms that it is the first publicly available dataset for endometrial cancer, containing both PET and CT images.

I will then look into **section II (Data and Method)**, where the authors describe the dataset preparation. Here, they mention that the ECPC-IDS consists of two sub-datasets:
1. **Sub-set A**: This includes 7159 images for semantic segmentation.
2. **Sub-set B**: This includes 3579 images for object detection.

The paper also specifies that the dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding its structure.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors reiterate the dataset's significance and its availability for non-commercial use, further emphasizing its importance in the field.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset from the **References section**. The citation for the ECPC-IDS dataset is:
> Dechao Tang, Tianmin Du, Deguo Ma, Zhiyu Ma, Hongzan Sun, Marcin Grzegorzek, Huiyan Jiang, Chen Li. *ECPC-IDS: A benchmark endometrial cancer PET/CT image dataset for evaluation of semantic segmentation and detection of hypermetabolic regions*. Available at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/ECPC-IDS/23808258.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
