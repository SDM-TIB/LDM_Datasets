To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling up Probabilistic Inference in Linear and Non-Linear Hybrid Domains by Leveraging Knowledge Compilation" by Anton R. Fuxjaeger and Vaishak Belle, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology and experiments to find specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for evaluation or testing their proposed methods. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **background or related work section**, I will check there as well, as authors often reference datasets used in previous studies that are relevant to their work.

Once I identify any datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find a dataset mentioned, I will note its name, a brief description, and then locate its full citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original source correctly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the information in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
