To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Busy-Quiet Video Disentangling for Video Classification" by Guoxi Huang and Adrian G. Bors, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method outperforms existing models on several datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four datasets: **Something-Something V1**, **Kinetics400**, **UCF101**, and **HMDB51**. I will take note of these names as they are crucial for my dataset extraction.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

1. **Something-Something V1**:
   > Goyal, R., Kahou, S. E., Michalski, V., Materzynska, J., Westphal, S., Kim, H., Haenel, V., Fruend, I., Yianilos, P., Mueller-Freitag, M., et al. (2017). The “something something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5842–5850.

2. **Kinetics400**:
   > Carreira, J., & Zisserman, A. (2017). Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4724–4733.

3. **UCF101**:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

4. **HMDB51**:
   > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Garrote, E., Poggio, T., & Serre, T. (2011). HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2556–2563.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
