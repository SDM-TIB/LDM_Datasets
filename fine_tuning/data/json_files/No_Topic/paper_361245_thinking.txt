To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Modeling of the Enteric Nervous System Employing Point Pattern Analysis and Graph Construction" by Abida Sanjana Shemonti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from images of human and mouse tissue samples obtained through confocal microscopy, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to these samples.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the architecture of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and mention that their models are developed using data from confocal images of human and mouse tissue samples. This implies that there are datasets related to these images, but I need to find more specific details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the biological data used for their models. They mention that confocal images of mouse and human ENS were utilized, specifically noting a sample ID for a child with Hirschsprung disease (sample ID: 2475-P). This is a clear indication of a dataset that can be referenced.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or sample IDs mentioned. The authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists various human ENS samples along with their physiological conditions and parameters of the generative model. This table includes sample IDs and their corresponding conditions, which are crucial for dataset identification.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The relevant datasets are:

1. **Human ENS Samples**: The authors used confocal images from various human ENS samples, including sample ID 2475-P, which is specifically noted as coming from a child with Hirschsprung disease. The citation for the study that provides details on these samples is:
   > Graham, K. D., López, S. H., Sengupta, R., Shenoy, A., Schneider, S., Wright, C. M., et al. (2020). Robust, 3-dimensional visualization of human colon enteric nervous system without tissue sectioning. *Gastroenterology*, 158(8), 2221–2235.e5. doi:10.1053/j.gastro.2020.02.035

2. **Mouse ENS Samples**: The authors also mention using confocal images of mouse ENS, but they do not provide a specific citation for these datasets in the text. However, the general reference for studies involving mouse ENS can be cited as:
   > Heuckeroth, R. O. (2018). Hirschsprung disease—integrating basic science and clinical medicine to improve outcomes. *Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology*, 15(3), 152. doi:10.1038/nrgastro.2018.1

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present them in the required format for further processing or review.
