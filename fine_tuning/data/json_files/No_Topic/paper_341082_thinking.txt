To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modelling Pre-fatigue, Low-velocity Impact and Fatigue behaviours of Composite Helicopter Tail Structures under Multipoint Coordinated Loading Spectrum" by Zheng-Qiang Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or prior studies that utilized datasets relevant to their research. This section often contains citations that can lead to the identification of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments. The authors may describe the data collection process or the sources of their data, which is crucial for identifying datasets.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. The authors may discuss the outcomes of their analyses in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or verified by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a previous study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation. If they describe a dataset they created or used, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
