To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual Learning with Recursive Gradient Optimization" by Hao Liu and Huaping Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art performance on **20-split-CIFAR100** and **20-split-miniImageNet**, indicating that these are datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more details about these datasets. The authors describe the benchmarks they evaluated their method on, specifically mentioning:

1. **20-split-CIFAR100**: This dataset is a random division of the CIFAR100 dataset into 20 tasks, with each task containing 5 different classes. This is a well-known dataset in the field of continual learning.

2. **20-split-miniImageNet**: Similar to CIFAR100, this dataset is a division of a subset of the original ImageNet dataset into 20 tasks. The authors reference this dataset as well, confirming its use in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 29.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **20-split-CIFAR100** - A division of CIFAR100 into 20 tasks.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **20-split-miniImageNet** - A division of miniImageNet into 20 tasks.
   - Citation: Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 29.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper, along with their full citations.
