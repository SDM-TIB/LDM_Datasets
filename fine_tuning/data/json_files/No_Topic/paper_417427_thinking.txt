To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training program on sign language: social inclusion through Virtual Reality in ISENSE project" by Alessia Bisio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a VR application for sign language recognition, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or data collection methods. The introduction discusses the importance of sign language and the role of technology in facilitating communication, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for details about the dataset used in the study. The authors describe the creation of a custom dataset that includes 50 sign variations per language, focusing on static signs for the alphabet, words, and sentences. This section provides critical information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In the **results section**, the authors summarize the classification results, which further confirms the use of the dataset for evaluating their sign language recognition algorithm. They mention that the dataset was divided into training and test sets with a 70%-30% distribution, which is important for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The authors reference a collection of videos from "Spread the Sign" as a source for their dataset. The citation for this source is:

- **Spread the Sign**: Thomas Lydell. European Sign Language Center. Retrieved June 2, 2023, from https://www.spreadthesign.com/

Since the dataset is custom and created for this specific study, it does not have a formal citation like established datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is based on the resources from "Spread the Sign."

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included where applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
