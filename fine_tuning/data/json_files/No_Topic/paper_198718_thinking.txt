To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Probabilistic Inference in Generic Neural Networks Trained with Non-Probabilistic Feedback" by A. Emin Orhan and Wei Ji Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of neural networks on various psychophysical tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to previous works that may have introduced these datasets.

In the **results** section, the authors describe training on nine probabilistic psychophysical tasks. I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets associated with these tasks. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references. If they refer to a dataset that is not widely known, I will ensure to capture the citation provided by the authors.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations.
