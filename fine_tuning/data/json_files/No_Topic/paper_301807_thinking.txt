To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk Ranked Recall: Collision Safety Metric for Object Detection Systems in Autonomous Vehicles" by Ayoosh Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new metric for evaluating object detection systems, indicating that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation process. The introduction references several datasets used for developing and evaluating object detection systems, specifically citing datasets [1] to [3].

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the introduction, where the authors refer to the **BDD100K**, **KITTI**, and **Waymo Open Dataset**. I will need to gather more details about these datasets, including their specific contributions to the research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The references are numbered, and I will locate the corresponding entries for the datasets:

1. **BDD100K**: The citation is:
   > F. Yu, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, M. Liao, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. "BDD100K: A diverse driving video database with scalable annotation tooling." arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04687, 2018.

2. **KITTI**: The citation is:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. "Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite." In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 3354â€“3361, 2012.

3. **Waymo Open Dataset**: The citation is:
   > P. Sun, H. Kretzschmar, X. Dotiwalla, A. Chouard, V. Patnaik, P. Tsui, J. Guo, Y. Zhou, Y. Chai, B. Caine, V. Vasudevan, W. Han, J. Ngiam, H. Zhao, A. Timofeev, S. Ettinger, M. Krivokon, A. Gao, A. Joshi, Y. Zhang, J. Shlens, Z. Chen, and D. Anguelov. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo Open Dataset," 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for understanding the context and validity of the findings presented in the paper.
