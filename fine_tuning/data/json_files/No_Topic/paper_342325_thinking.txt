To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning on Rail Profiles Matching" by Kunqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the establishment of a rail profiles matching dataset composed of **46,386 pairs of professional manual matched data**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Dataset section** (section 2), where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the dataset's construction, including the number of samples, the division into training, validation, and test sets, and the characteristics of the images used. The dataset consists of images that contain both the designed and measured profiles, which are crucial for the matching process.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **46,386 samples** in total.
- The samples are divided into:
  - **Training set**: 32,480 samples (~70%)
  - **Validation set**: 6,976 samples (~15%)
  - **Test set**: 6,930 samples (~15%)

The dataset is designed to capture various shapes of rail section profiles, including typical section profiles, switch section profiles, and frog section profiles. This diversity is important for the model's training and evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it is an original dataset created by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is referred to as the "Rail Profiles Matching Dataset" and provide the citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Kunqi Wang, Daolin Si, Pu Wang, Jing Ge, Peiyuan Ni, Shuguo Wang. *Deep Learning on Rail Profiles Matching*. Railway Engineering Research Institute, China Academy of Railway Sciences Corporation Limited, Beijing, China, 2023.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and the citation for the paper, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
