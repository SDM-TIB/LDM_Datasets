To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alexa doesn’t have that many feelings: Children’s understanding of AI through interactions with smart speakers in their homes" by Valentina Andries and Judy Robertson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and findings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their mixed-methods approach involving questionnaires and interviews with primary-school children. I will look for any specific datasets that were collected during these processes. The paper mentions that 166 children completed the questionnaire, which is a key dataset.

In the **findings section**, I will look for any specific data points or results that are presented in a structured format, such as tables or figures. The paper includes various figures and tables that summarize the responses from the questionnaires, which can be considered datasets.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **Questionnaire Dataset**: This dataset includes responses from 166 primary-school children regarding their interactions with smart speakers. The data covers various aspects such as the frequency of use, perceptions of AI, and trust in conversational assistants.

2. **Interview Dataset**: This dataset consists of qualitative data gathered from group interviews with children, providing insights into their understanding and perceptions of conversational assistants.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies that were referenced in the paper. However, since the datasets are primarily based on the authors' own research, I will focus on citing the paper itself.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Andries, V., & Robertson, J. (2023). Alexa doesn’t have that many feelings: Children’s understanding of AI through interactions with smart speakers in their homes. Centre for Research in Digital Education, The University of Edinburgh.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper as it serves as the primary source for the datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
