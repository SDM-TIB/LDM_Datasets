To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plug-and-Play Methods for Magnetic Resonance Imaging" by Rizwan Ahmad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of MRI and the need for efficient reconstruction methods, hinting at the use of datasets but not naming them yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments with two specific datasets:

1. **Cardiac Cine Datasets**: The authors mention that they acquired 50 fully sampled, high-SNR cine datasets from eight healthy volunteers. They provide details about the spatial and temporal resolutions, the number of frames, and the specific imaging views used. This dataset is crucial for demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed methods.

2. **Single-coil fastMRI Knee Data**: The authors refer to the single-coil fastMRI dataset, which contains fully-sampled k-space data partitioned into training and testing slices. They specify that this dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their PnP methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cardiac Cine Datasets**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is implied that the data was collected from healthy volunteers and processed using specific methods. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on original research conducted by the authors.

- For the **Single-coil fastMRI Knee Data**, the citation is:
  > J. Zbontar, F. Knoll, A. Sriram, M. J. Muckley, M. Bruno, A. Defazio, M. Parente, K. J. Geras, J. Katsnelson, H. Chandarana et al., “fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI,” arXiv:1811.08839, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
