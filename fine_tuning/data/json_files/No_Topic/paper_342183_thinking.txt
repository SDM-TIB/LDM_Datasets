To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experimentally realized in situ backpropagation for deep learning in nanophotonic neural networks" by Sunil Pai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the work, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it usually details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for training or testing the models. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss the training and testing of the photonic neural networks. The authors may describe the datasets used for training the models, including any synthetic datasets they generated for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Li Deng, “The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research,” IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 29, 141–142 (2012).

If they mention any custom datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and any relevant publication or repository links provided by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the research paper.
