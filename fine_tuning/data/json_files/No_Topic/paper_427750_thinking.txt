To extract datasets from the research paper titled "State Estimation Using Single Body-Frame Bearing Measurements" by Sifeddine Benahmed and Soulaimane Berkane, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of measurements from various sensors, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of simulation results. The authors describe a simulation scenario involving a vehicle moving in 3D space, but they do not specify any datasets used for training or validation. Instead, they focus on the simulation parameters and the performance of their proposed observer.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. However, the references primarily consist of works related to algorithms and methodologies rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets cited or used in the experiments. The authors rely on simulated data generated from their own models rather than external datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are explicitly mentioned or cited in the paper, I will note that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research work. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have provided their full citations as required. 

Overall, my extraction process involved careful reading of the relevant sections and cross-referencing with the references to ensure completeness.
