To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling RIS Empowered Outdoor-to-Indoor Communication in mmWave Cellular Networks" by Mahyar Nemati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of reconÔ¨Ågurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) for outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) communication, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for simulations or analyses. In this paper, the authors describe their performance analysis and simulations, but they do not seem to mention specific datasets directly. Instead, they refer to various models and parameters used in their simulations.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited works that may include datasets. The references include various studies and papers, but they primarily focus on theoretical models and previous works related to RIS and mmWave communications rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors reference several studies and models that could potentially be sources of data for future research.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in this paper, and I will provide a citation for the paper itself for reference:

- Mahyar Nemati, Behrouz Maham, Shiva Raj Pokhrel, and Jinho Choi. "Modeling RIS Empowered Outdoor-to-Indoor Communication in mmWave Cellular Networks." [Insert publication details here if available].

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly searched for datasets while also providing proper citations for the paper and any relevant references.
