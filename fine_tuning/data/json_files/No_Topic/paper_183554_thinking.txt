To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is a Picture Worth Ten Thousand Words in a Review Dataset?" by Roberto Camacho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework using the **Yelp Challenge Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the challenges of mapping reviews to images and mention the **Yelp dataset** specifically. This reinforces the idea that the Yelp dataset is a key component of their work.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They state that the dataset contains **25,071 restaurants, 1,363,242 reviews, and 98,786 images**. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides quantitative details that are important for understanding its scope.

I will also check the **experiments and evaluation sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any subsets of the Yelp dataset. However, the primary focus remains on the Yelp dataset throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the Yelp dataset. The citation for the Yelp dataset is as follows:
> Yelp. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Yelp dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **Yelp Challenge Dataset**, which is essential for the authors' proposed framework and evaluation.
