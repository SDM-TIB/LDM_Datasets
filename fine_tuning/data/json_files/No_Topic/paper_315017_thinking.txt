To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pathogen Evolution During Vaccination Campaigns" by Troy Day et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's focus, which may include key datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections** to identify any specific datasets that the authors utilized for their analyses. This includes looking for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that may be included in these sections.

I will also pay close attention to any **appendices** or **supplementary materials** that may contain additional information about datasets used in the study. These sections often provide detailed descriptions of datasets, including their sources and characteristics.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided by the authors, such as the number of samples, types of data collected, and the context in which the datasets were used.

Once I have compiled a list of datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced in future work.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Data," I will look for the corresponding citation in the References section to document it fully.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation.

Finally, I will compile all the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the paper.
