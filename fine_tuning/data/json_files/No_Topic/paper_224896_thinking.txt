To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Satellite Pose Estimation with Deep Landmark Regression and Nonlinear Pose Refinement" by Bo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of estimating the 6DOF pose of satellites, which suggests that datasets related to satellite images and poses may be discussed.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention the "Kelvins Pose Estimation Challenge (KPEC)" and that participants were provided with training images containing ground truth poses. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with this challenge.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their experiments. They specifically mention the **Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset (SPEED)**, which consists of 12,000 training images with ground truth 6DOF poses and 2,998 testing images without ground truth. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of images, their resolution, and the variations in object size and background.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citation of the SPEED dataset. The authors reference the SPEED dataset as follows:

- For **SPEED**, the citation is:
  > Bo Chen, Jiewei Cao, Álvaro Parra, Tat-Jun Chin. *Satellite Pose Estimation with Deep Landmark Regression and Nonlinear Pose Refinement*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Spacecraft PosE Estimation Dataset (SPEED)**: This dataset contains high-fidelity grayscale images of the Tango satellite, with 12,000 training images and 2,998 testing images. Each image has a resolution of 1920×1200 pixels, and the dataset includes ground truth 6DOF poses for the training images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
