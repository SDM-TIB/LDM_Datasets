To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning over Coupled Graphs" by Runze Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **12 real-world datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list the datasets along with some details about each, such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and attributes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **CORA**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 7 classes, and 1,433 attributes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 6 classes, and 3,703 attributes.
3. **PubMed**: A larger citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 3 classes, and 500 attributes.
4. **DBLP**: A co-authorship network dataset with 17,716 nodes, 52,867 edges, 4 classes, and 1,639 attributes.
5. **Coauthor-CS**: A co-authorship dataset in computer science with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, 15 classes, and 6,805 attributes.
6. **Coauthor-Phy**: A co-authorship dataset in physics with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, 5 classes, and 8,415 attributes.
7. **ACM**: A co-authorship dataset from ACM with 3,025 nodes, 13,128 edges, 3 classes, and 1,870 attributes.
8. **BlogCatalog**: A social network dataset with 5,196 nodes, 171,743 edges, 6 classes, and 8,189 attributes.
9. **Flickr**: A social network dataset with 7,575 nodes, 239,738 edges, 9 classes, and 12,047 attributes.
10. **Amazon-CS**: A product co-purchase dataset with 13,752 nodes, 287,209 edges, 10 classes, and 767 attributes.
11. **Amazon-Photo**: Another product co-purchase dataset with 7,650 nodes, 143,663 edges, 8 classes, and 745 attributes.
12. **UAI**: An Internet document network dataset with 3,067 nodes, 28,311 edges, 19 classes, and 4,973 attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
