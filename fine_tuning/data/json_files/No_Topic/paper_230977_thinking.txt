To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy Preserving Gaze Estimation using Synthetic Images via a Randomized Encoding Based Framework" by Efe Bozkir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic eye images for gaze estimation, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved, specifically synthetic images generated for the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **data generation subsection** (3.1), where the authors describe how they generated the eye images and gaze vectors. Here, they mention using **UnityEyes** to create synthetic images, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **data generation section**, the authors specify that they rendered **20,000 images** with specific parameters, including eye landmarks and gaze vectors. This is crucial information as it outlines the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the UnityEyes dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **UnityEyes**:
  > Erroll Wood, Tadas Baltrušaitis, Louis-Philippe Morency, Peter Robinson, and Andreas Bulling. *Learning an Appearance-Based Gaze Estimator from One Million Synthesised Images*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Biennial ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA ’16). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 131–138. https://doi.org/10.1145/2857491.2857492

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **experiments section**. However, the primary dataset used for training and evaluation appears to be the synthetic images generated from UnityEyes.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
