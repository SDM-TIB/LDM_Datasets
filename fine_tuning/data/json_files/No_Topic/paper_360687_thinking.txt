To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectrum-BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Spectral Classification of Chinese Liquors" by Yansong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "real liquor spectral dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiment section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention that the tested liquors are selected from 12 brands in the Chinese market, including various types of Maotai-Flavor, Luzhou-Flavor, and Fen-Flavor liquors. They specify that 100 sample data points were taken at different times for each liquor, which provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure.

The authors also describe the process of data collection, calibration, and normalization, which further confirms the existence of a dataset. They do not provide a specific name for the dataset, but they refer to it as the "liquor spectral dataset" throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not publicly available or referenced in other works, as the authors mention the challenges of obtaining and labeling spectral data for Chinese liquors.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will create a citation entry based on the information provided in the paper. The citation will include the authors, title, and a brief description of the dataset:

- **Liquor Spectral Dataset**: This dataset consists of spectral data collected from 12 different brands of Chinese liquors, with 100 samples taken for each brand. The dataset is used for training and evaluating the Spectrum-BERT model for spectral classification tasks.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the information I have gathered, ensuring to include the relevant details and citation format.

In summary, the dataset extraction process involved identifying the dataset's existence through the abstract and experimental sections, confirming its details in the experiment setup, and creating a citation based on the information provided in the paper.
