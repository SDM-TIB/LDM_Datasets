To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Mining using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Latent Semantic Analysis" by Ali Hassani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment details)**, which typically contains a table or description of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets, including their names, number of documents, terms, classes, and references. 

In this paper, I find a table (Table 2) that lists several datasets used in the experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **20 Newsgroups**: This dataset is divided into several categories, including Computer, Politics, Miscellaneous, Religion, and Science. It contains a total of 18,000 documents across these categories.

2. **AG News**: A corpus of news articles collected from over 2,000 webpages, categorized into four classes.

3. **BBC Sport**: This dataset categorizes BBC Sports transcripts into five groups: Football, Rugby, Tennis, Athletic, and Cricket.

4. **BBC News**: Similar to the BBC Sport dataset, but it categorizes BBC News transcripts into five categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, and Technology.

5. **DMOZ**: A dataset containing text information from the DMOZ (Open Directory Project) with 13 classes.

6. **SMS**: A dataset containing non-spam and spam text messages, which has been resampled for balance.

7. **WebKB**: A dataset collected from webpages categorized into seven classes.

8. **WebAce**: A dataset consisting of over 1,500 web documents in 21 categories.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
