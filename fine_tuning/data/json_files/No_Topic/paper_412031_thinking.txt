To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Head Orientation Estimation with Distributed Microphones Using Speech Radiation Patterns" by Kaspar MÃ¼ller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Directivity of Human Speech)**, where the authors discuss datasets related to speech directivity. Specifically, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, their descriptions, and how they were utilized in the study.

In **section II.A (Datasets of Measured Speech Directivities)**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset 1**: This dataset consists of speech directivities averaged over 40 human talkers and the directivity of a B&K 4128 head and torso simulator (HATS) in 1/3-octave bands between 160 Hz and 8 kHz.

2. **Dataset 2**: This dataset includes speech directivities averaged over 6 human talkers and the directivity of a KEMAR HATS in 1/3-octave bands between 100 Hz and 10 kHz with a finely sampled angular grid.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

For **Dataset 1**, the citation is:
> W. T. Chu and A. C. C. Warnock. "Detailed directivity of sound fields around human talkers." Tech. Rep., 2002.

For **Dataset 2**, the citation is:
> S. D. Bellows, C. M. Pincock, J. K. Whiting, and T. W. Leishman. "Average speech directivity." Tech. Rep. 1, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
