To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-Shot Imitation from Observing Humans via Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning" by Tianhe Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the ability of robots to learn from a single video demonstration, which suggests that there may be datasets related to human demonstrations and robot demonstrations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention using human demonstrations and robot demonstrations for various tasks, specifically in the context of placing, pushing, and pick-and-place tasks. I will look for specific names of datasets or descriptions that indicate the nature of the data used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe collecting human demonstrations from various backgrounds and using robot demonstrations collected via teleoperation. They mention that they used a dataset with hundreds of objects, consisting of 1293, 640, and 1008 robot demonstrations for placing, pushing, and pick-and-place tasks, respectively. However, they do not provide specific dataset names, so I will need to infer the datasets based on the context.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might correspond to the datasets used. The authors may reference prior works that describe the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset. If specific dataset names are not provided, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' experiments and provide a general description based on the context.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the following:
1. **Dataset Name**: If explicitly mentioned, or a descriptive title if not.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
3. **Citation**: Full citation for the dataset or the original work that describes it.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
