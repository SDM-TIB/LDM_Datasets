To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Eager Satisfiability Modulo Theories Solver for Algebraic Datatypes" by Amar Shah, Federico Mora, and Sanjit A. Seshia, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a new SMT solver and mentions benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmark sets. They mention the need for efficient SMT solvers and the challenges faced by existing tools, which may lead to the identification of datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 5 (Empirical Evaluation)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention two existing benchmark sets from SMTCOMP, as well as a new benchmark set they generated consisting of blocks world queries. This section is crucial as it likely contains the specific datasets used in their experiments.

The two existing benchmark sets mentioned are:
1. **Bouvier Benchmark Set**: This set is referenced as being useful but limited, consisting of queries that existing solvers struggle with.
2. **Blocks World Benchmark Set**: This new benchmark set consists of randomly generated blocks world queries, which are more challenging and contain various types of algebraic data types.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for these benchmark sets. However, since the benchmark sets are likely not standalone datasets with formal citations, I will note the context in which they are used in the paper.

For the **Bouvier Benchmark Set**, the citation is:
> Bouvier, P. 2021. The VLSAT-3 Benchmark Suite. INRIA Technical Report 516.

For the **Blocks World Benchmark Set**, since it is a new set generated by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but is described in detail in section 5 of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about these datasets, ensuring to include the context and citations where applicable. This will allow me to create a structured output that accurately reflects the datasets discussed in the paper.
