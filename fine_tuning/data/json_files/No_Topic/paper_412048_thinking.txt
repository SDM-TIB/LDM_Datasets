To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OplixNet: Towards Area-Efficient Optical Split-Complex Networks with Real-to-Complex Data Assignment and Knowledge Distillation" by Ruidi Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I will need to look deeper into the sections where experiments are discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of various neural network models and their applications, but I need to find specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In these sections, the authors describe the neural network models tested, specifically mentioning datasets like **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100**. These datasets are crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed OplixNet framework.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
