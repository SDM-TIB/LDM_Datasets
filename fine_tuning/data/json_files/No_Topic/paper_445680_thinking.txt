To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Large Language Models Strategic Decision Makers? A Study of Performance and Bias in Two-Player Non-Zero-Sum Games" by Nathan Herr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on LLMs in strategic games, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of LLMs and their applications in various fields, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons. 

Upon reviewing the **methodology**, I find that the authors mention using data from a previous study by Belloc et al. (2019) for their preliminary study comparing human and AI performance in the Stag Hunt game. This indicates that the dataset from Belloc et al. is relevant to my extraction.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer back to the dataset from Belloc et al. for their analysis. The results section discusses findings based on the experiments conducted but does not introduce new datasets.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset used from Belloc et al. The citation is as follows:
- Belloc, M., Bilancini, E., Boncinelli, L., & Dâ€™Alessandro, S. (2019). Intuition and deliberation in the stag hunt game. *Scientific Reports*, 9(1), 14833. DOI: 10.1038/s41598-019-51380-0.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the paper.
