To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learned Radio Interferometric Imaging for Varying Visibility Coverage" by MatthÄ³s Mars et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for efficient reconstruction techniques and mentions the use of simulated data from the IllustrisTNG simulations, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction provides context about radio interferometry and mentions the challenges of processing data from telescopes, but it does not specify datasets yet.

I will then focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their training strategies and data generation process. Here, they mention creating a dataset of measurements using images of simulated galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **training and training data section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They specify that they used 2000 images for training and 1000 for testing, derived from the IllustrisTNG simulations. This section also mentions that the images are augmented during training, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the IllustrisTNG simulations, as this is the primary dataset used in the study. The relevant citation is:

- For the **IllustrisTNG simulations**, the citation is:
  > Nelson, D., et al. (2019). "Computational Astrophysics and Cosmology," *6*, 2. doi:10.1186/s40672-019-0002-8.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset from IllustrisTNG simulations**: This dataset consists of images of simulated galaxies used for training and testing the reconstruction networks. The authors used 2000 images for training and 1000 for testing, with specific augmentation techniques applied during training.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
