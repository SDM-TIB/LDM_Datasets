To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Episodic Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Curiosity-driven Exploration" by Lulu Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsections that discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this benchmark in the text, including any references to the tasks or scenarios within the benchmark that were used for evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark, I will look for the original source or any relevant papers that describe the benchmark in detail.

The citation for the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark is:
> Mikayel Samvelyan, Tabish Rashid, Christian Schroeder de Witt, Gregory Farquhar, Nantas Nardelli, Tim GJ Rudner, Chia-Man Hung, Philip HS Torr, Jakob Foerster, and Shimon Whiteson. *The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems, pages 2186â€“2188, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
