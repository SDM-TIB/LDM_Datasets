To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining recurrent and residual learning for deforestation monitoring using multitemporal SAR images" by Carla Nascimento Neves et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **Sentinel-1 multitemporal data**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they specify that they employed **Sentinel-1 data** from a site in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, characterized by mixed land cover, primarily dense evergreen forests and pastures. They detail that the dataset consists of **seven images** captured over a period from August 2019 to August 2020, with a resolution of **9327 × 5767 pixels** and two polarizations (VV and VH).

In this section, the authors also mention that the reference map of deforestation used in their analysis is available on the **INPE website**, which is crucial for understanding the ground truth for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset. However, since the Sentinel-1 data is a publicly available dataset, I will provide a general citation format for it, as specific papers detailing the dataset may not be directly referenced in this paper.

The citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset can be formatted as follows:
> European Space Agency. *Sentinel-1: A European radar mission to provide an all-weather, day-and-night supply of imagery of Earth’s surface*. Available at: https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1

Additionally, the authors reference the **PRODES Project** for the ground truth data, which can be cited as:
> Valeriano, D. M., Mello, E. M., Moreira, J. C., Shimabukuro, Y. E., Duarte, V., Souza, I., Santos, J., Barbosa, C. C., & Souza, R. (2004). Monitoring tropical forest from space: the PRODES digital project. *International Archives of Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences*, 35, 272–274.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
