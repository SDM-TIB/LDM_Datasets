To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural networks: deep, shallow, or in between?" by Guergana Petrova and Przemyslaw Wojtaszczyk, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in their studies.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections dedicated to datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there doesn't seem to be a section explicitly labeled as "Datasets," but I will check the **experiments section** for any mentions of datasets used for validation or testing of their theoretical results.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced, including their names and any relevant details provided by the authors. If the authors mention using existing datasets, I will look for citations that can provide the full references for these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the complete citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original papers or sources that introduced those datasets, as these will serve as the authoritative citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
