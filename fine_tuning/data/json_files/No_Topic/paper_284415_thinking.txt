To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Noise Meets Chaos: Stochastic Resonance in Neurochaos Learning" by Harikrishnan NB and Nithin Nagaraj, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "simulated and real-world spoken digit datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (SR in NL with multiple GLS Neurons)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they mention two types of datasets:

1. **Concentric Circle Data (CCD)**: This dataset is used for a binary classification task involving two concentric circles. The paper provides details about the number of classes and instances for training and testing.

2. **Overlapping Concentric Circle Data (OCCD)**: Similar to CCD, this dataset is also used for binary classification but involves overlapping circles. The authors provide specific details about the number of training and testing instances.

Additionally, in **section 3.2**, the authors discuss the **Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)**, which consists of voice recordings of spoken digits from six speakers. They specify that they used recordings from one speaker and provide details about the number of recordings per class.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Concentric Circle Data (CCD)** and **Overlapping Concentric Circle Data (OCCD)**, since these are simulated datasets created for the study, they may not have formal citations. However, I will note the details provided in the paper.

- For the **Free Spoken Digit Dataset (FSDD)**, the citation is:
  > Jakobovski, D. *Free Spoken Digit Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/Jakobovski/free-spoken-digit-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
