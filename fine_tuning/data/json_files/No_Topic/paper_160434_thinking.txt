To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonparametric Pricing Analytics with Customer Covariates" by Ningyuan Chen and Guillermo Gallego, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses personalized pricing analytics but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then check the **literature review** and **experiments sections** for any references to datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets that were utilized for testing the proposed pricing policy. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names and descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will check for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain additional information about the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, clearly indicating each dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
