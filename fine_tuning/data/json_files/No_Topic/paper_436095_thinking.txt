To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-Cybersecurity Education Through Designing AI-based Cyberharassment Detection Lab" by Ebuka Okpala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. This section typically details the experimental setup and may list the datasets used for training or evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the outcomes of their experiments, which could include performance metrics on the datasets. This could provide additional context about the datasets used and their relevance to the study.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to cyberharassment detection, as that is the focus of the study. I will note any datasets that are explicitly named, such as those used for training machine learning models or for evaluation purposes.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Identify any datasets explicitly named or described.
3. Check the references section for full citations of these datasets.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the descriptions and citations.
