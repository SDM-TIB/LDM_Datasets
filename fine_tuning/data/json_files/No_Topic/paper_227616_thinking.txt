To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Representation for EHR Signals and Codes as Patient Status Vector" by Sajad Darabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a two-step unsupervised representation learning scheme and evaluates the method on two downstream tasks: mortality and readmission. This indicates that there may be datasets involved, particularly related to electronic health records (EHR).

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the **eICU collaborative Research Database v2.0** as the dataset utilized for their study. The authors provide details about the dataset, including its size (over 200,000 ICU records), the time period of data collection (2014-2015), and the nature of the data (including diagnosis codes, medication codes, treatment codes, and vital signals).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the eICU dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Tom J Pollard, Alistair EW Johnson, Jesse D Raffa, Leo A Celi, Roger G Mark, and Omar Badawi. *The eicu collaborative research database, a freely available multi-center database for critical care research*. Scientific data, 5, 2018.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the eICU collaborative Research Database v2.0 is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
