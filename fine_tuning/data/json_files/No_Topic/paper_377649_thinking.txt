To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPEC: Summary Preference Decomposition for Low-Resource Abstractive Summarization" by Yi-Syuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on six diverse corpora, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will note this as a potential indicator of datasets to look for.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section V) to find specific mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly list the corpora used for evaluation, which include:

1. **Amazon Product Reviews**: This dataset is referenced as a source for summarization tasks.
2. **Reddit-TIFU**: Another dataset used for evaluating the summarization methods.
3. **Movie Reviews**: This dataset is included in the experiments to assess performance.
4. **SAMSum**: A dialogue dataset that is also part of the evaluation.
5. **SciTLDR**: A dataset for summarizing scientific documents.
6. **XSum**: A dataset for extreme summarization tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper documentation. 

The citations I will look for are:

- For **Amazon Product Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Keung, P., Lu, Y., Szarvas, G., & Smith, N. A. (2020). The multilingual Amazon reviews corpus. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 4563–4568.

- For **Reddit-TIFU**, the citation is:
  > Kim, B., Kim, H., & Kim, G. (2019). Abstractive summarization of Reddit posts with multi-level memory networks. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 2519–2531.

- For **Movie Reviews**, the citation is:

- For **SAMSum**, the citation is:
  > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). SAMSum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pp. 70–79.

- For **SciTLDR**, the citation is:
  > Cachola, I., Lo, K., Cohan, A., & Weld, D. (2020). TLDR: Extreme summarization of scientific documents. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pp. 4766–4777.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1797–1807.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
