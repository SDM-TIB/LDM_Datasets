To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Orchestrated AI Workflows Execution on Scale-out Spatial Architecture" by Jinyi Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or evaluation section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any specific names of datasets used in the experiments, along with descriptions of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics.

In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks in the **evaluation methodology section**. The benchmarks include:

1. **Emotion Recognition (ER)**: This benchmark involves video processing with resolutions of 1920×1080, 960×720, and 640×380 at 30fps, lasting between 3 to 30 minutes. It utilizes 20-50 videos of varying resolutions and lengths.

2. **Driver and Passenger Status Recognition (DPSR)**: Similar to ER, this benchmark also involves video processing with specific resolutions and frame rates.

3. **Street Flow Recognition (SFR)**: This benchmark is focused on video processing and has similar characteristics to the previous benchmarks.

4. **Crowd Mask Recognition (CMR)**: Another video processing benchmark, details about its specific dataset characteristics are also provided.

5. **One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS)**: This benchmark is for image processing, using a resolution of 1800 unique images.

6. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: This benchmark also involves image processing and utilizes a dataset of 1800 unique images.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or benchmarks mentioned. If the datasets are derived from existing works, I will ensure to cite the original sources accurately.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **Emotion Recognition (ER)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *Emotion Recognition Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

- For **Driver and Passenger Status Recognition (DPSR)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *Driver and Passenger Status Recognition Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

- For **Street Flow Recognition (SFR)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *Street Flow Recognition Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

- For **Crowd Mask Recognition (CMR)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *Crowd Mask Recognition Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

- For **One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (OSVOS)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *One-Shot Video Object Segmentation Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

- For **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, the citation is:
  > ModelArts. *Optical Character Recognition Benchmark*. 2023. Available: https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/modelarts.html.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
