To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Study of Market Impact Conditional on Order-Flow Imbalance" by Anastasia Bugaenko, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "publicly available trades and quotes data," which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Research Methodology)**, where the author describes the datasets used for the analysis. In **subsection 3.2 (The Dataset)**, the author specifies that the research utilizes **LOBSTER data**, which is a significant dataset for analyzing trades and quotes from the NASDAQ electronic stock exchange. The author provides details about the data source, indicating that it is reconstructed from NASDAQ’s Historical TotalView-ITCH files.

In **subsection 3.2.1 (LOBSTER Data)**, the author elaborates on the dataset, explaining that it includes detailed information about market events, such as submissions, cancellations, and executions of limit orders. This dataset is crucial for the empirical analysis conducted in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LOBSTER dataset. The citation for the LOBSTER data is as follows:
> Huang, Ruihong, Charles-Albert Lehalle, and Mathieu Rosenbaum. "LOBSTER: Limit Order Book Reconstruction System." 2015. URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1977207.

Additionally, I will note that the paper analyzes data from four specific NASDAQ stocks: **SIRI, EBAY, TSLA, and PCLN**. However, the paper does not provide separate citations for these stocks as datasets since they are part of the broader LOBSTER dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LOBSTER dataset, as it is the primary dataset used in the research.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **LOBSTER Data**: A dataset for analyzing trades and quotes from the NASDAQ electronic stock exchange, reconstructed from NASDAQ’s Historical TotalView-ITCH files.
   - Citation: Huang, Ruihong, Charles-Albert Lehalle, and Mathieu Rosenbaum. "LOBSTER: Limit Order Book Reconstruction System." 2015. URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1977207.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
