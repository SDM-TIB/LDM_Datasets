To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kronecker PCA Based Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Video for Dismount Classification" by Kristjan H. Greenewald and Alfred O. Hero III, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of KronPCA for video dismount classification, which suggests that a dataset is involved, particularly for gender classification.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **SWAG-1 gender recognition dataset**. The description indicates that this dataset consists of videos of pedestrians walking in various weather conditions, with a total of 356 videos (89 for each gender). This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and context.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SWAG-1 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being released by AFRL, and the citation provided is:

> McCoppin, R., Koester, N., Rude, H. N., Rizki, M., Tamburino, L., Freeman, A., and Mendoza-Schrock, O. "Electro-optical seasonal weather and gender data collection." Proceedings of SPIE 8751, 87510H–87510H–9 (2013).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the context of the dataset.
2. Focus on the dataset section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references for the identified dataset.

This method ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset used in the research paper.
