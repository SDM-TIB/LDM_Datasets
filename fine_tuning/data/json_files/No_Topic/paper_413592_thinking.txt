To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JPIS: A Joint Model for Profile-Based Intent Detection and Slot Filling with Slot-to-Intent Attention" by Thinh Pham and Dat Quoc Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the JPIS model establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on the **Chinese benchmark dataset ProSLU**. This indicates that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors discuss the benchmark dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specify that the **ProSLU dataset** consists of 4,196 training utterances, 522 validation utterances, and 531 test utterances, along with user-associated feature vectors and context awareness vectors. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ProSLU dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For **ProSLU**, the citation is:
  > Xiao Xu, Libo Qin, Kaiji Chen, Guoxing Wu, Linlin Li, and Wanxiang Che. “Text Is No More Enough! A Benchmark for Profile-Based Spoken Language Understanding,” in AAAI, 2022.

Since the ProSLU dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for ProSLU, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is crucial for proper attribution. After this, I will finalize the dataset entry for review or further processing.
