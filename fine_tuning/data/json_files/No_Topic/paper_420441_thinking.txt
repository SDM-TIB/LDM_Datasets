To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precedence-Constrained Winter Value for Effective Graph Data Valuation" by Hongliang Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted across diverse datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A larger citation network dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A dataset with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, and 8 classes.
5. **Amazon-Computer**: This dataset contains 13,752 nodes, 245,861 edges, and 10 classes.
6. **Coauthor-Physics**: A dataset with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, and 8 classes.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or statistics about these datasets, as they often contain supplementary information that can be useful.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, and I can find their citations as follows:

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Citeseer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Pubmed**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **Amazon-Photo** and **Amazon-Computer**, the citations are:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

- For **Coauthor-Physics**:
  > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & G¨unnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.05868*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
