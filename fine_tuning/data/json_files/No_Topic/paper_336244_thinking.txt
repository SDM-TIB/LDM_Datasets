To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Query Transfer Attacks on Context-Aware Object Detectors" by Zikui Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted using images from both the **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. The authors state that they conducted experiments using images from both datasets, specifically mentioning that they randomly selected 500 images from **voc2007test** and **coco2017val**. This confirms the datasets and provides additional context regarding the specific subsets used for evaluation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. **MS COCO Dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
