To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Temporal Convolutional Network for Anticipating Actions in Egocentric Videos" by Olga Zatsarynna et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on two large-scale datasets of egocentric videos, specifically **EPIC-Kitchens-55** and **EPIC-Kitchens-100**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly describe both datasets in **section 4.2 (Datasets)**. Here, they provide detailed information about each dataset:

1. **EPIC-Kitchens-55**: This dataset contains videos collected by 32 participants capturing daily kitchen activities, with a total of 55 hours of recordings and 39,596 action annotations. It includes 125 verb and 352 noun classes, resulting in 2,513 unique action classes. The authors also mention the availability of RGB frames and pre-computed optical flow frames.

2. **EPIC-Kitchens-100**: This dataset extends EPIC-Kitchens-55, containing 100 hours of footage collected by 37 participants in 45 environments. It has 89,977 fine-grained action annotations, with 97 verb and 300 noun classes, leading to 3,806 action classes. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **EPIC-Kitchens-55**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Sanja Fidler, Antonino Furnari, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2018.

- For **EPIC-Kitchens-100**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari, Jian Ma, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Rescaling egocentric vision*. In CoRR, abs/2006.13256, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review.
