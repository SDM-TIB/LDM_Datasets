To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A random walk Monte Carlo simulation study of COVID-19-like infection spread" by S. Triambak and D. P. Mahapatra, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference specific datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their random walk Monte Carlo simulations. This section is likely to detail the datasets used for the simulations, including any specific parameters or data sources that were incorporated into the study.

In the **results section**, I will look for any figures, tables, or descriptions that indicate the datasets used for analysis. The authors may present results based on specific datasets, which will help confirm their relevance.

I will also check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any additional mentions of datasets or data sources that may not have been explicitly detailed earlier in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used publicly available datasets related to COVID-19 infection rates, mortality data, or other epidemiological data. I will look for specific names of datasets, such as those from health organizations or previous studies.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will involve formatting the citations correctly and ensuring that they are complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
