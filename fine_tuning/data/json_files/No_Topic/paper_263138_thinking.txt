To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Elementary Effects Analysis of factors controlling COVID-19 infections in computational simulation reveals the importance of Social Distancing and Mask Usage" by Kelvin K. F. Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, which hints at the use of simulation data related to COVID-19 interventions.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their agent-based simulation model. Here, they detail the parameters and variables used in their simulations, which may include references to datasets or sources of data.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the simulation results, as these often contain key data points or references to datasets used in the analysis. The authors may also discuss the datasets in relation to their findings, which can provide additional context.

I will also examine the **references section** to find citations for any datasets or studies that the authors relied upon. This is crucial for obtaining full citations, as the authors may reference previous works that contain the datasets they used.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Agent-Based Simulation Data**: The paper describes a simulation model with parameters such as population size, infection rates, and control measures. However, it does not specify a publicly available dataset but rather presents the simulation results derived from their model.

2. **COVID-19 Infection Data**: The authors reference real-world data from various countries (e.g., the UK, Hong Kong, and Italy) to validate their model. I will need to find the original sources of this data to provide full citations.

Next, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

- For the **COVID-19 infection data**, the citations may include:
  > Worldometer. "COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic." Available at: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

- For the **agent-based simulation model**, since it is based on the authors' own work, I will cite the paper itself:
  > Li, K. K. F., Jarvis, S. A., & Minhas, F. (2020). Elementary Effects Analysis of factors controlling COVID-19 infections in computational simulation reveals the importance of Social Distancing and Mask Usage. *Journal Name*, *Volume*(Issue), pages. DOI or URL if available.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the study, along with the proper citations, to facilitate further research or validation of the findings presented in the paper.
