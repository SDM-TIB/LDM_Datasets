To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Speech Recognition with Pitch and Voice Quality Features" by Guillermo Cámbaro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **Spanish Common Voice** and **LibriSpeech 100h** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data subsection**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they describe the **Spanish Common Voice dataset** as an open-source corpus consisting of recordings from volunteers, and the **LibriSpeech 100h dataset** as a collection of audio book recordings. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further context about the datasets used. However, the focus remains on the two datasets already identified.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **Spanish Common Voice dataset**, the citation is:
   > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. 2019.

2. For the **LibriSpeech 100h dataset**, the citation is:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in this research paper.
