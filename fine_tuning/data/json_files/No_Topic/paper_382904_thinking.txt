To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SegGPT Meets Co-Saliency Scene" by Yi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating SegGPT on co-salient object detection using three datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three public co-salient object detection datasets:

1. **CoSOD3k**: This dataset is described as containing 50 groups with a total of 2015 images.
2. **CoCA**: This dataset is noted to be the most challenging, containing 1295 images across 80 groups.
3. **CoSal2015**: This dataset includes 160 groups with a total of 3316 images.

I will also verify the details of these datasets in the **references section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CoSOD3k**, the citation is:
  > D.-P. Fan, T. Li, Z. Lin, G.-P. Ji, D. Zhang, M.-M. Cheng, H. Fu, and J. Shen. "Re-thinking co-salient object detection." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 44, no. 8, pp. 4339–4354, 2021.

- For **CoCA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Zhang, W. Jin, J. Xu, and M.-M. Cheng. "Gradient-induced co-saliency detection." In *Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part XII*, pp. 455–472. Springer, 2020.

- For **CoSal2015**, the citation is:
  > D. Zhang, J. Han, C. Li, J. Wang, and X. Li. "Detection of co-salient objects by looking deep and wide." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 120, pp. 215–232, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
