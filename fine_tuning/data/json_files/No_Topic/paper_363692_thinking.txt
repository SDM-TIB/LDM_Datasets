To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neurodevelopmental Phenotype Prediction: A State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Model" by D´aniel Unyi and B´alint Gyires-T´oth, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from the **Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP)**, which suggests that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset. The authors mention that they analyze cortical surface data of neonates derived from the dHCP, which reinforces its importance.

In the **methods section**, specifically in **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They state that the dataset contains the cortical surface of **588 neonatal subjects**, along with metadata such as gestational age (GA) at birth, postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan, sex, birthweight, head circumference, and radiology score. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its composition.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the dataset is referenced again, but since the dataset is primarily discussed in the methods section, I will focus on that for extraction.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). The authors reference several papers related to the dHCP, but the most relevant citation appears to be:

> Makropoulos, A., Robinson, E. C., Wright, R., Schuh, A., Fitzgibbon, S., Bozek, J., ... & Rueckert, D. (2018). The Developing Human Connectome Project: A minimal processing pipeline for neonatal cortical surface reconstruction. *Neuroimage*, 173, 88-112.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset's origin and its significance in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the dHCP as required. This will ensure that the dataset is accurately represented and properly credited in any subsequent documentation or analysis.
