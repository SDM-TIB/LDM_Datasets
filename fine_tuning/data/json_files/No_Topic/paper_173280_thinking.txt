To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Critique of a Critique of Word Similarity Datasets: Sanity Check or Unnecessary Confusion?" by Minh Le, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions a critical evaluation of word similarity datasets, specifically citing **mc, rg, and men** as datasets under scrutiny. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the paper's discussion.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might elaborate on these datasets. In the **introduction**, the author discusses the reliability of small datasets and mentions **Rubenstein and Goodenough (1965)** and **Miller and Charles (1991)**, which are also datasets relevant to word similarity. This suggests that I should include these datasets as well.

In the **main body**, the author critiques the sanity check proposed by Batchkarov et al. (2016) and discusses the datasets **mc** (Miller and Charles), **rg** (Rubenstein and Goodenough), and **men** (Bruni and Baroni, 2014). The author provides insights into the performance and reliability of these datasets, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. For **mc (Miller and Charles)**, the citation is:
   > George A. Miller and Walter G. Charles. *Contextual correlates of semantic similarity*. Language and Cognitive Processes, 6(1):1–28, 1991. doi: 10.1080/01690969108406936.

2. For **rg (Rubenstein and Goodenough)**, the citation is:
   > Herbert Rubenstein and John B. Goodenough. *Contextual correlates of synonymy*. Communications of the ACM, 8(10):627–633, 1965. doi: 10.1145/365628.365657.

3. For **men (Bruni and Baroni)**, the citation is:
   > Elia Bruni and Marco Baroni. *Multimodal Distributional Semantics*. 49:1–47, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
