To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale Promoted Self-adjusting Correlation Learning for Facial Action Unit Detection" by Xin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on widely used AU detection benchmark datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **BP4D Dataset**: This dataset contains 2D and 3D data of spontaneous facial expressions from 41 subjects, with a total of 328 videos and approximately 140,000 frames annotated with AU labels. 

2. **DISFA Dataset**: This dataset records facial expression data from 27 subjects while watching video clips intended to elicit spontaneous emotion expression, containing about 130,000 frames annotated with AU intensity.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BP4D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Zhang, L. Yin, J. F. Cohn, S. Canavan, M. Reale, A. Horowitz, P. Liu, and J. M. Girard. "BP4D-Spontaneous: A high-resolution spontaneous 3D dynamic facial expression database." *Image and Vision Computing*, vol. 32, no. 10, pp. 692–706, 2014.

- For the **DISFA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. M. Mavadati, M. H. Mahoor, K. Bartlett, P. Trinh, and J. F. Cohn. "DISFA: A spontaneous facial action intensity database." *IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing*, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 151–160, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
