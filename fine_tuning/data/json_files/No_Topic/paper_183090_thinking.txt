To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonrigid Optical Flow Ground Truth for Real-World Scenes with Time-Varying Shading Effects" by Wenbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a dense ground truth dataset for nonrigidly deforming real-world scenes, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details. Here, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and emphasize the need for a new ground truth dataset for evaluating optical flow algorithms. This reinforces the idea that they are introducing a novel dataset.

I will then focus on the **section II (Non-Rigid Ground Truth Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe their dataset. They mention that their dataset includes both short and long video sequences, which are crucial for evaluating RGB-based tracking and registration methods. They also detail the methodology for capturing ground truth data using RGB-NIR imaging.

In this section, the authors provide specific information about the dataset, including:
- The dataset contains dense inter-frame correspondences from eight short sequences and five long sequences.
- Each short sequence consists of ten frames, while the long sequences contain 50 frames.

The authors also describe the characteristics of the sequences, such as "single," "illumination," "mObjs," "triObjs," "featureless," "crease," "blur," and "str.shadow," which indicate the diversity of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **experiments** section to confirm that the dataset was used in their evaluations. The authors mention evaluating existing optical flow methods on their new dataset, which validates its application in real-world scenarios.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide a specific citation for their dataset, as it is a new contribution. However, they reference existing datasets and methodologies that influenced their work.

Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, I will create a citation for it based on the authors and title. The citation will be formatted as follows:

- For the new dataset:
  > Wenbin Li, Darren Cosker, Zhihan Lv, and Matthew Brown. *Nonrigid Optical Flow Ground Truth for Real-World Scenes with Time-Varying Shading Effects*. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, accepted June 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset information and citation into a structured format for further processing.
