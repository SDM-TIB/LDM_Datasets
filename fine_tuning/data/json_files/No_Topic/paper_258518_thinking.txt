To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EB-DEVS: A Formal Framework for Modeling and Simulation of Emergent Behavior in Dynamic Complex Systems" by Daniel J. Foguelman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but specific datasets are likely to be detailed in the case studies.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section**. The authors present three case studies: the SIR model, the Boids model, and the mitochondria model. I will look for any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced in these case studies.

1. **SIR Model**: The authors mention using a configuration model graph for the SIR model. I will check if they provide a specific dataset or reference for this model.

2. **Boids Model**: The authors describe the Boids model and its implementation. I will look for any datasets related to the parameters or simulations used in this model.

3. **Mitochondria Model**: The authors reference a modified version of Dalmassoâ€™s model. I will check if they provide a dataset or reference for the mitochondrial dynamics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset related to the SIR model, I will ensure to include the full citation from the references.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all datasets are accurately documented and attributed to their respective sources.
