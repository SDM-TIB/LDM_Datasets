To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Searchable Hidden Intermediates for End-to-End Models of Decomposable Sequence Tasks" by Siddharth Dalmia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on the **Fisher-CallHome corpus** and the **MuST-C corpus**, indicating that these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **data and experimental setup** section (section 5) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **Fisher-CallHome corpus**: This dataset contains 170 hours of Spanish conversational telephone speech, along with transcriptions and English translations. The authors note that they report results in terms of BLEU scores and provide references for the original dataset.

2. **MuST-C corpus**: This is a multilingual speech translation corpus that includes recordings of TED talks in English with translations in various target languages. The authors mention using 400 hours of English-German and 500 hours of English-French data from this corpus.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Fisher-CallHome corpus**, the citation is:
> Matt Post, Gaurav Kumar, Adam Lopez, Damianos Karakos, Chris Callison-Burch, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Improved speech-to-text translation with the Fisher and Callhome Spanish–English speech translation corpus*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2013).

For the **MuST-C corpus**, the citation is:
> Mattia A. Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 2012–2017, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset entry contains the name, description, and full citation, which is essential for proper documentation and referencing in future work.
