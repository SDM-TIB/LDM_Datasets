To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sector connectedness in the Chinese stock markets" by Ying-Ying Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on volatility spillovers within Chinese sectors, which suggests that stock market data is likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Method and Data)**, where the authors describe the data used for their analysis. Here, they mention that the analysis is performed on **28 different sector indices in the Chinese stock markets** issued by Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., Ltd. This indicates that the dataset consists of sector indices, which is crucial for my extraction.

In this section, the authors provide a list of the sectors along with their abbreviations, which includes:
- Agriculture and forestry (A&F)
- Mining (Mining)
- Chemical (Chem)
- Steel (Steel)
- Non-ferrous metals (NFMet)
- Electronic (Elec)
- Household appliances (HApp)
- Food and drink (F&D)
- Textile and apparel (T&A)
- Light manufacturing (LMF)
- Biotechnology (Biotech)
- Utilities (Util)
- Transportation (Trans)
- Real estate (REst)
- Commercial trade (ComT)
- Leisure and services (L&S)
- Composite (Cps)
- Building materials (BM)
- Building and decoration (B&D)
- Electrical equipment (ElecE)
- National defence (ND)
- Computer (Cpt)
- Media (Media)
- Communications (Comm)
- Bank (Bank)
- Non-bank financial (NBF)
- Automobile (Auto)
- Mechanical equipment (MechE)

The authors also specify that the data spans from **January 4, 2000, to December 31, 2019**, and includes daily records of open, high, low, and close indices for each sector. This information is essential for documenting the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is proprietary and specific to the authors' analysis, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the source as Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., Ltd. and mention that it is a proprietary dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and source. The full citation for the dataset will be noted as:
- **Dataset Name**: Chinese Sector Indices
- **Description**: Daily sector indices data for 28 sectors in the Chinese stock markets, including open, high, low, and close values from January 4, 2000, to December 31, 2019.
- **Source**: Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., Ltd. (http://www.swsresearch.com)

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the paper, ready for further processing or analysis.
