To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Evolution of Blockchain: from Lit to Dark" by Agostino Capponi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on blockchain dark venues and mentions empirical support, which suggests that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical analysis section (Section 6)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their analysis. In this section, they mention using transaction-level data from various sources, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed.

Upon reviewing Section 6.2 (Data), the authors specify the datasets they utilized:

1. **Uniswap and Sushiswap Transaction Data**: This dataset includes transaction-level data from these decentralized exchanges, which is crucial for identifying frontrunning arbitrages. The authors collected this data from their own Ethereum node, covering transactions from block number 10000835 created on May 4, 2020, to block number 12344944 created on April 30, 2021.

2. **Flashbots API Data**: The authors collected transaction data submitted through the Flashbots relay service, starting from February 11, 2021, when the first Flashbots block was mined, until July 31, 2021. This dataset is essential for analyzing the adoption of dark venues.

3. **Ethereum Block Data**: The authors acquired Ethereum block data from Blockchair, which covers the period from May 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021. This dataset includes information on gas fee revenues earned by miners.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the methodology. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets with the relevant details and provide citations for the papers or sources that describe the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Uniswap and Sushiswap Transaction Data**: 
  > Wang, Y., Partick, Z., Yao, Y., Lu, Z., & Wattenhofer, R. (2022). *Impact and User Perception of Sandwich Attacks in the DeFi Ecosystem*. In ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), New Orleans, LA, USA.

- **Flashbots API Data**: 
  > Daian, P., Goldfeder, S., Kell, T., Li, Y., Zhao, X., Bentov, I., Breidenbach, L., & Juels, A. (2020). *Flash Boys 2.0: Frontrunning in Decentralized Exchanges, Miner Extractable Value, and Consensus Instability*. In 2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), 910â€“927.

- **Ethereum Block Data**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
