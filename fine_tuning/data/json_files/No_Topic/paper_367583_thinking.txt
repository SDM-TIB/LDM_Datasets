To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sentence-level Feedback Generation for English Language Learners: Does Data Augmentation Help?" by Shabnam Behzad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created multiple pseudo datasets for the task, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 2.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ICNALE (International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English)**: This dataset contains essays from Asian learners of English, specifically focusing on two topics. The authors note that it includes sentences annotated for preposition errors, which is crucial for their feedback generation task.

2. **W&I+LOCNESS**: This dataset is a combination of data from the Write & Improve platform and the LOCNESS corpus. The authors explain that they selected sentences with preposition errors from this dataset to create additional pseudo data.

In the **pseudo data section (2.3)**, the authors elaborate on how they generated pseudo datasets from these sources, specifically mentioning the number of sentences included in each dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ICNALE**, the citation is:
  > Shin'ichiro Ishikawa. 2013. The ICNALE and sophisticated contrastive interlanguage analysis of Asian learners of English. Learner corpus studies in Asia and the world, 1(1):91–118.

- For **W&I+LOCNESS**, the citation is:
  > Sylviane Granger. 2014. The computer learner corpus: a versatile new source of data for SLA research. In Learner English on computer, pages 3–18. Routledge.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ICNALE**: A dataset of essays from Asian learners of English, annotated for preposition errors.
2. **W&I+LOCNESS**: A combined dataset from the Write & Improve platform and LOCNESS, containing sentences with preposition errors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
