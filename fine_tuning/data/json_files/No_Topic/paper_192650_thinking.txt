To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Association Graph Screening and Decomposition for Large-scale Linear Dynamical Systems" by Yiyuan She et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions experiments on both synthetic data and real-world applications, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)** and **section 6 (Applications)**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments and analyses.

In **section 5**, the authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic data and real-world applications, specifically referencing the **S&P 500** and **NASDAQ-100** datasets. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Now, I will gather the details about each dataset:

1. **S&P 500 Dataset**: This dataset includes closing prices of S&P 500 stocks from January 1, 2003, to January 1, 2008, consisting of 1258 samples for 452 stocks. The data has been preprocessed by taking logarithm and differencing transformations.

2. **NASDAQ-100 Dataset**: This dataset consists of closing prices of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ stock market, collected for the year 2011, with a total of 252 samples. The authors mention that differencing was applied to remove trends.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in financial research, they may not have formal citations like other datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details that were mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
