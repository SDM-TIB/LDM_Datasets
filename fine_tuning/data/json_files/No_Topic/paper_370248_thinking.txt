To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with LiDAR intensity" by Wenqiang Du and Giovanni Beltrame, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses various SLAM methods but does not specify datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention testing their method with a public dataset provided by Shan et al. (2021), which was collected using an Ouster OS1-128 LiDAR. This indicates that there is at least one dataset used in their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about this dataset, including its name and characteristics. The authors refer to the dataset as being collected by Shan et al., which suggests that I need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

In the **References section**, I will locate the citation for the work by Shan et al. (2021). The relevant citation is:
> T. Shan, B. Englot, F. Duarte, C. Ratti, and D. Rus, “Robust place recognition using an imaging lidar,” 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5469–5475, 2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Ouster OS1-128 LiDAR Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset was collected using the Ouster OS1-128 LiDAR sensor and is used for evaluating the proposed SLAM method in various environments.
   - **Citation**: T. Shan, B. Englot, F. Duarte, C. Ratti, and D. Rus, “Robust place recognition using an imaging lidar,” 2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 5469–5475, 2021.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
