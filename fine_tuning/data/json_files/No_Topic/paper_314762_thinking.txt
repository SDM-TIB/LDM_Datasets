To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task and Multi-Corpora Training Strategies to Enhance Argumentative Sentence Linking Performance" by Jan Wira Gotama Putra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in argument mining and the need for annotated corpora. They mention that existing corpora are relatively small, which suggests that they may be using specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the **ICNALE-AS2R corpus**, which consists of 434 essays written by Asian college students with intermediate proficiency. The authors provide details about the corpus, including the total number of sentences and the structure of the annotations.

The paper also references the **PEC (Persuasive Essay Corpus)**, which is used in conjunction with the ICNALE-AS2R corpus for multi-corpora training. The authors describe how they filter the PEC essays based on specific criteria to ensure compatibility with the ICNALE-AS2R corpus.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ICNALE-AS2R corpus**, the citation is:
   > Shinichiro Ishikawa. *The ICNALE and Sophisticated Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis of Asian Learners of English*. Learner Corpus Studies in Asia and the World, 1:91–118, 2013.

2. For the **PEC**, the citation is:
   > Christian Stab and Iryna Gurevych. *Parsing Argumentation Structures in Persuasive Essays*. Computational Linguistics, 43(3):619–659, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
