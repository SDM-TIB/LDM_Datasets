To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians" by David M. Blei, Alp Kucukelbir, and Jon D. McAuliffe, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on variational inference, but I need to look for specific datasets in the body of the text.

Next, I will examine the **sections that detail applications or examples of variational inference**. These sections often contain references to datasets used in the experiments or case studies. I will pay particular attention to any mentions of datasets in the context of empirical studies or examples, as these are likely to provide the names and details of the datasets used.

As I read through the paper, I will look for specific phrases such as "we used the dataset," "the experiments were conducted on," or "the following datasets were analyzed." These phrases typically indicate the presence of datasets.

Once I identify any datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references. If it is not directly cited, I may need to search for the dataset online to find the appropriate citation.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, and I will prepare this information for presentation or further analysis.
