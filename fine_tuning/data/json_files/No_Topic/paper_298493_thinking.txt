To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LIGHTWEIGHT COMPRESSION OF NEURAL NETWORK FEATURE TENSORS FOR COLLABORATIVE INTELLIGENCE" by Robert A. Cohen, Hyomin Choi, and Ivan V. Bajić, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a lightweight compression technique for deep neural networks but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific mentions in the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss collaborative intelligence applications but do not name any datasets. I will proceed to the **experimental results section** where they describe their experiments with various neural networks.

In **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, the authors mention applying their compression technique to activations from three different inference scenarios: **YOLOv3**, **VGG-16**, and **ResNet-50**. They specify that the experiments used the **COCO 2017 validation dataset** for YOLOv3 and the **ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validation dataset** for VGG-16 and ResNet-50. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO 2017 dataset**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), September 2014.

2. For the **ImageNet ILSVRC2012 dataset**, the citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, December 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
