To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thompson Sampling for Combinatorial Network Optimization in Unknown Environments" by Alihan Hüyük and Cem Tekin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to contain dataset information, such as **section IV (Networking Applications)**, where the authors describe various applications of their proposed method. This section is likely to detail the datasets used for simulations or experiments.

In the **Networking Applications section**, the authors mention three specific applications: cascading bandits, probabilistic maximum coverage bandits, and influence maximization bandits. I will check if they provide any details about the datasets used in these applications.

1. **Cascading Bandits**: The authors reference a setup involving web pages and user interactions but do not specify a dataset name. However, they mention that they generated probabilities uniformly at random, which indicates a synthetic dataset rather than a publicly available one.

2. **Probabilistic Maximum Coverage Bandits**: The authors state that they used the MovieLens dataset, which is a well-known dataset for movie ratings. I will note this dataset and its relevance to the experiments.

3. **Influence Maximization Bandits**: The authors mention using a directed version of the Facebook network dataset, which consists of edges and nodes. This dataset is also significant for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MovieLens dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens datasets: history and context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems*, 5(4), 19:1–19:19.

- For the **Facebook network dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., & Mcauley, J. J. (2012). Learning to discover social circles in ego networks. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25* (pp. 539–547).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
