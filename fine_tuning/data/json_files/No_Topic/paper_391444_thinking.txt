To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Solutions to the Privacy vs. Utility Tradeoff" by Sagnik Chatterjee and Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of quantum cryptographic primitives but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations. The introduction discusses generative models and their vulnerabilities but does not specify any datasets.

I will then focus on the **technical overview and discussion sections**. These sections may contain references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons. I will look for any mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of membership inference attacks or generative models.

If I do not find explicit mentions of datasets in these sections, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the work. The references may include datasets used in prior studies that the authors have built upon.

After identifying any datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. This may involve looking up the original papers or sources that describe the datasets if they are not provided in the current paper.

If I find any datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
