To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Investment under Information Driven Contagious Distress" by Lijun Bo and Agostino Capponi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for analysis. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will review it to see if the authors discuss the datasets in the context of their findings. This section may provide additional insights into how the datasets were used and their significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size, type, and content.
3. **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and ensure that all necessary details are captured accurately.
