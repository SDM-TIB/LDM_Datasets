To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Generalization Behaviours of Generative Flow Networks" by Lazar Atanackovic and Emmanuel Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (A Benchmark Task for Investigating Generalization Behaviours of GFlowNets)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they are utilized in the experiments.

In this section, the authors mention a **small graph environment** with all possible graphs of size 7 and less, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. They also describe various reward functions associated with this dataset, which indicates the complexity and structure of the data.

Additionally, I will check **section 4 (Experiments)** for any further mentions of datasets, especially in the context of the experiments conducted. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were used to validate their hypotheses.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets like the **Branin** or **Currin** tasks in the hypergrid environment, I will ensure to find the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
