To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Studying Retrievability of Publications and Datasets in an Integrated Retrieval System" by Dwaipayan Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Study)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention that they utilized the integrated search system GESIS Search, which contains a total of 830K indexed records, including over 64K research datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed a significant part of their study.

In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, the authors provide specific statistics about the datasets, including the number of records and types. They mention that the indexed records are divided into six categories, with a focus on publications and datasets. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for individual datasets in this section.

To find the full citations for the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper. While the paper does not explicitly list individual datasets with citations, it references the GESIS Search system, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. The citation for the GESIS Search system is:

- GESIS Search: 
  > Daniel Hienert, Dagmar Kern, Katarina Boland, Benjamin Zapilko, and Peter Mutschke. *A Digital Library for Research Data and Related Information in the Social Sciences*. In 2019 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL), pages 148â€“157, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1109/JCDL.2019.00030

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations beyond the GESIS Search system, I will note that the datasets referenced are part of this integrated system, and the citation for the system itself will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the study.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the citation for the GESIS Search system as the source of the datasets.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction to identify the focus on datasets.
2. Examine section 5 for details on the datasets used.
3. Locate the citation for the GESIS Search system in the References section, which serves as the authoritative source for the datasets mentioned in the study.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
