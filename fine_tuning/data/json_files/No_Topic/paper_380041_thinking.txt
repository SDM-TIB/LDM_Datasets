To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tangent-based manifold approximation with locally linear models" by Sofia Karygianni and Pascal Frossard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental results section typically details the datasets used for validation.

In the **abstract**, I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to validate their approach. If the abstract mentions specific datasets, I will note them down.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit references to datasets. The authors may discuss previous works that utilized certain datasets or mention datasets that are standard in the field of manifold approximation.

Then, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for classification tasks, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Y. Lecun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998, pp. 2278–2324.

If they mention any other datasets, such as the **Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS)**, I will find its citation as well:
> D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. "A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics." In ICCV, vol. 2, 2001, pp. 416–423.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
