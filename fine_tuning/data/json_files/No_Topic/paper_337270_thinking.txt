To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning new physics efficiently with nonparametric methods" by Marco Letizia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for specific names, characteristics, and any relevant details about the datasets.

In section 4.1, the authors describe three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **DIMUON Dataset**: This dataset consists of simulated LHC collision events producing two muons in the final state. It includes five dimensions of features related to the muons and is used to study new physics contributions.

2. **SUSY Dataset**: This dataset is composed of simulated LHC collision events with two charged leptons and missing momentum. It has eight raw features and ten high-level features, and it is used to analyze supersymmetric particle decays.

3. **HIGGS Dataset**: This dataset involves simulated events where the signal is the production of heavy Higgs bosons. It contains 21 raw features and seven high-level features, and it is used to study Higgs boson production.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided in the text, so I will look for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **DIMUON Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pierre Baldi, Peter Sadowski, and Daniel Whiteson. *Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning*. Nature Commun., 5:4308, 2014.

- For the **SUSY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pierre Baldi, Peter Sadowski, and Daniel Whiteson. *Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning*. Nature Commun., 5:4308, 2014.

- For the **HIGGS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pierre Baldi, Peter Sadowski, and Daniel Whiteson. *Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning*. Nature Commun., 5:4308, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
