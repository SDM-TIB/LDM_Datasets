To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of fish location by combining fisheries data and sea bottom temperature forecasting" by Matthieu Ospici et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper combines fisheries data and environmental data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Proposed framework)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Satellite Data**: This dataset consists of sea bottom temperature data collected from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The authors specify that the data covers a rectangular area in the North Sea from 2006 to 2020, totaling 5,295 days of temperature data.

2. **Fisheries Data**: This dataset includes species landings from the Belgian fishing fleet, compiled from electronic logbook and Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data. The authors mention that this dataset contains 1,684,560 observations from 2006 to 2020.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (CMEMS and the fisheries data) may not have specific citations in the references, as they are likely standard datasets used in the field.

For the **Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)**, I will note that it is a widely recognized source for marine data, but I will also look for any specific citation or documentation that can be referenced.

For the **fisheries data**, the authors refer to a procedure described in reference [4] for merging the datasets. I will retrieve the citation for this reference to provide context for the fisheries data.

The citations I will include are:

- For **Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)**, I will use:
  > Copernicus Marine Service. *Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service*. [Online]. Available: https://marine.copernicus.eu/

- For the **fisheries data**, I will cite:
  > Hintzen, N.T., Bastardie, F., Beare, D., Piet, G.J., Ulrich, C., Deporte, N., Egekvist, J., Degel, H. (2012). "VMStools: Open-source software for the processing, analysis and visualization of fisheries logbook and VMS data." *Fisheries Research*, 115-116, 31-43.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
