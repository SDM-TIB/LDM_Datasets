To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoding Neural Activity to Assess Individual Latent State in Ecologically Valid Contexts" by Stephen M. Gordon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly **section 2.3 (Data Description)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. This section typically includes the names, purposes, and characteristics of the datasets used in the study.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **DS_LOAD**: This dataset is used for training a model related to single vs. dual tasking. It includes EEG data from 17 participants performing visual and auditory tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Brouwer, A.M., Hogervorst, M.A., Oudejans, B., Ries, A.J. and Touryan, J. (2017). EEG and eye tracking signatures of target encoding during structured visual search. *Frontiers in human neuroscience*, 11, p.264.

2. **DS_ALERT**: This dataset is used for training a model related to alert vs. drowsy driving. It consists of EEG data from 14 participants in a simulated driving experiment. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lin, C.T., Wu, R.C., Jung, T.P., Liang, S.F. and Huang, T.Y. (2005). Estimating driving performance based on EEG spectrum analysis. *EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing*, 2005(19), pp.1-10.

3. **DS_VALIDATE_LOAD**: This dataset is used for validation and includes EEG data from 17 participants performing a guided visual search task. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ries, A.J., Touryan, J., Ahrens, B. and Connolly, P. (2016). The impact of task demands on fixation-related brain potentials during guided search. *PloS one*, 11(6), p.e0157260.

4. **DS_VALIDATE_ALERT**: This dataset is also for validation and consists of EEG data from 22 participants who performed a visual working memory task. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mei, N., Grossberg, M.D., Ng, K., Navarro, K.T. and Ellmore, T.M. (2018). A high-density scalp EEG dataset acquired during brief naps after a visual working memory task. *Data in brief*, 18, pp.1513-1519.

5. **DS_COMPLEX**: This dataset is used for testing and involves EEG data from 18 participants performing a complex driving task. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Metcalfe, J.S., Marathe, A.R., Haynes, B., Paul, V.J., Gremillion, G.M., Drnec, K., Atwater, C., Estepp, J.R., Lukos, J.R., Carter, E.C. and Nothwang, W.D. (2017). Building a framework to manage trust in automation. In *Micro-and nanotechnology sensors, systems, and applications IX* (Vol. 10194, p. 101941U). International Society for Optics and Photonics.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references as required.
