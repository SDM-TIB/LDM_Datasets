To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superiority of GNN over NN in generalizing bandlimited functions" by A. Martina Neuman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often contain valuable information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets such as:

1. **Dataset A**: I will note its description, including the number of samples, features, and any relevant details about how it was used in the experiments.
2. **Dataset B**: Similar to Dataset A, I will document its characteristics and how it contributes to the research findings.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which can be useful for future research or replication of the experiments.

Finally, I will format the information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is well-documented with its citation, making it easy for others to reference and utilize the datasets in their own work.
