To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformers in Unsupervised Structure-from-Motion" by Hemang Chawla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention experiments conducted on the **KITTI** and **DDAD** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe the KITTI dataset, specifically mentioning the Eigen Split, which contains 39,810 training images, 4,424 validation images, and 697 test images. This dataset captures various scenes from rural, city, and highway areas around Karlsruhe, Germany.

2. **Dense Depth for Autonomous Driving (DDAD) Dataset**: The authors provide details about the DDAD dataset, which consists of 12,650 training samples and 3,950 test samples from diverse urban scenarios across multiple cities in the United States and Japan.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to ensure I can provide full citations for each dataset. The citations I will extract are:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

- For the **DDAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Guizilini, R. Ambrus, S. Pillai, A. Raventos, and A. Gaidon. *3D packing for self-supervised monocular depth estimation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2485–2494, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
