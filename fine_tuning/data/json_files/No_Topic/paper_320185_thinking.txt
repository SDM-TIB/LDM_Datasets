To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated pharyngeal phase detection and bolus localization in videofluoroscopic swallowing study: Killing two birds with one stone?" by Andrea Bandini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a dataset of **1245 bolus-level clips from 59 healthy subjects**, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 2.2 (Rating procedure and dataset)**, where the authors describe how they collected and processed the data. They mention that the dataset consists of **1245 bolus-level clips** derived from VFSS recordings, which were manually annotated by trained speech-language pathologists. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance metrics related to the dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. They also provide insights into the characteristics of the dataset, such as the number of clips per bolus consistency.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is likely a proprietary dataset collected by the authors. However, they reference the ASPEKT guidelines for rating VFSS clips, which may be relevant for understanding the dataset's context.

Since the dataset is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' own research and is based on the VFSS recordings conducted under the ethical approval of the Research Ethics Board at UHN - Toronto Rehabilitation Institute.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Bolus-level clips from videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS)
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 1245 bolus-level clips from 59 healthy subjects, used for detecting the pharyngeal phase and localizing the bolus during swallowing.
   - **Citation**: Not publicly available; derived from the authors' research and based on the ASPEKT guidelines for VFSS rating.

With this information compiled, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
