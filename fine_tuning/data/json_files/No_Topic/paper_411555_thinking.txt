To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Navigating News Narratives: A Media Bias Analysis Dataset" by Shaina Raza, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the "Navigating News Narratives: A Media Bias Analysis Dataset," indicating that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **Dataset Description** section, specifically **2.1 Data Composition**, where the dataset's attributes are outlined. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset's structure, including key attributes like ID, Text, Dimension, Biased Words, Aspect, and Label. This confirms that the dataset is comprehensive and well-defined.

In **2.3 Data Sources**, the paper lists several datasets that have been integrated into the main dataset. I will extract the names of these datasets along with their citations. The sources mentioned include:

1. **MBIC (media bias)** by Spinde et al., 2021.
2. **Hyperpartisan news detection data** by Kiesel et al., 2019.
3. **Toxic comment classification challenge data** from Kaggle by cjadams et al., 2017.
4. **Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification** by Kivlichan et al., 2020.
5. **Age Bias and Sentiment Analysis data** by Díaz et al., 2018.
6. **News bias data related to Ukraine** by Färber et al., 2020.
7. **Social bias frames** by Sap et al., 2019.

I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete picture of the dataset's origins.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy throughout the extraction process.
