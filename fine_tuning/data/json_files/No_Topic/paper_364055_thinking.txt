To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tire-road friction estimation and uncertainty assessment to improve electric aircraft braking system" by F. Crocetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a data-driven scheme based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the training and evaluation of the model.

Next, I will focus on **section III (The Friction Estimation Neural Net)**, where the authors discuss the training dataset. They mention that the MLP training is based on a large number of input vectors derived from the Burckhardt model, which is a key indicator of the dataset used. The authors specify that the dataset consists of **479,320 samples** generated using the Burckhardt model, which is crucial for understanding the context of the data.

In this section, they also describe the construction of the dataset, including the use of **windowed sequences of (λ, µ) pairs** and the introduction of noise to improve robustness. This detailed description helps in understanding the nature of the dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any references to other datasets used for validation or comparison. However, the primary dataset appears to be the synthetic dataset based on the Burckhardt model.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Burckhardt model, as it is the basis for the synthetic dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the Burckhardt model:
  > M. Burckhardt. *Fahrwerktechnik: Radschlupf-Regelsysteme*. Würzburg: Vogel Verlag, 1993.

Since the paper primarily relies on this synthetic dataset derived from the Burckhardt model, I will document it as the main dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
