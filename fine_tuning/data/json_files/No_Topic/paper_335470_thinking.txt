To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning by non-interfering feedback chemical signaling in physical networks" by Vidyesh Rao Anisetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their algorithm using the **Iris dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **Methods** or **Experiments** sections. In this paper, the **Iris dataset** is explicitly mentioned in **section III (The Iris Data Set)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its composition and how it is utilized in their experiments.

The Iris dataset is described as follows:
- It contains **150 examples** of Iris flowers belonging to three species: setosa, virginica, and versicolor, with **50 examples for each category**. Each example consists of four features (petal width, petal length, sepal width, and sepal length), which are measured in centimeters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Iris dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
- For the **Iris dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Fisher. *Iris.* UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1988.

Since the Iris dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

In summary, I will create an entry for the Iris dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
