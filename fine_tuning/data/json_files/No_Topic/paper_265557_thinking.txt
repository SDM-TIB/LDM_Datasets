To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Intrinsic Instability of Financial Markets" by Sabiou Inoua, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's focus but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may hint at empirical data or datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss empirical facts, models, or experiments. In this paper, sections like **"Empirical facts"** and **"Explaining the empirical facts"** are likely candidates for containing references to datasets. I will look for any mentions of specific datasets, their sources, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. This section may provide full citations for datasets that the author has used or referred to in the analysis. 

As I identify datasets, I will take note of the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains, including the type of data, the number of entries, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Financial Market Data," I would look for details such as:
- The number of observations or time periods covered.
- The types of financial instruments included (stocks, bonds, etc.).
- Any specific methodologies used to collect or analyze the data.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
