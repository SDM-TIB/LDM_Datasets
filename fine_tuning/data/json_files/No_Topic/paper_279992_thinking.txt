To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Video Instance Segmentation by Light-weight Temporal Uncertainty Estimates" by Kira Maag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating their tracking algorithm on the **KITTI** and **MOT datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Numerical Results)**, where the authors discuss their experiments in detail. Here, they explicitly mention using the **KITTI dataset** for multi-object tracking and instance segmentation, which contains 21 street scene videos, and the **MOT dataset**, which consists of pedestrian scenes. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

For the **MOT dataset**, the citation is:
> A. Milan, L. Leal-Taix√©, I. D. Reid, S. Roth, and K. Schindler. *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. ArXiv, vol. abs/1603.00831, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and further research.
