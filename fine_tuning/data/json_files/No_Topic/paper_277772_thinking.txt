To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The time function of stock price" by Shengfeng Mei and Hong Gao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main sections** of the paper, focusing on any references to datasets or empirical analyses. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (The Characteristic of Time Domain)**, where the authors discuss the autocorrelation function and empirical analyses. Here, they reference a study by Zhuang et al. (2001) that analyzes the autocorrelation function based on the Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI index from December 19, 1990, to June 1, 2000. This indicates that the authors utilized this dataset for their analysis.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **references** sections to ensure that I capture any additional datasets mentioned. The references provide citations for the studies and datasets used throughout the paper.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the identified dataset:

1. **Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI Index**: This dataset is used for the empirical analysis of the autocorrelation function of stock prices. The authors reference the work of Zhuang et al. (2001), which provides the context for the dataset's use.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the dataset from the references section:

- For the **Shanghai and Shenzhen CSI Index**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X., Huang, X., & Zheng, Y. (2001). Correlation Analysis in View of DFA the Index of the Stock Price. *Journal of Dong Hua University, Natural Science*, 27(3), 28-31.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or output formatting as required.
