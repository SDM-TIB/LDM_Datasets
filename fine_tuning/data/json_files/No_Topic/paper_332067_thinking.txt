To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidding Agent Design in the LinkedIn Ad Marketplace" by Yuan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of automated bidding in online advertising but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, as this is often where datasets are detailed. In this paper, the authors discuss practical learnings from a deployed bidding system in the LinkedIn ad marketplace. However, they do not specify any datasets used for training or evaluation in the experiments. Instead, they focus on the optimization framework and its application in a real-world setting.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will also check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing algorithms, optimization methods, and related work in online advertising, rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no specific datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on a theoretical framework and practical implementation without referencing any external datasets.

Since no datasets are identified, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting the absence of datasets in the paper.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not include any datasets, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
