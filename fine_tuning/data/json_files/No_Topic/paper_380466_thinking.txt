To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning To Optimize Quantum Neural Network Without Gradients" by Ankit Kulshrestha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical evaluation of the proposed method on different datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI), where the authors describe their numerical experiments. Here, they mention three datasets used for pattern classification tasks:

1. **Gaussian Dataset**: A synthetic dataset where two-dimensional clusters are created by drawing samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution.
2. **Spheres Dataset**: A collection of 3D points forming concentric spheres, with one sphere enveloping the other.
3. **Iris Dataset**: A truncated version of the well-known Iris dataset, consisting of two classes and four features describing a particular species.

In this section, the authors provide details about how these datasets are used in their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and commonly used in machine learning, they may not have specific citations in the paper. Instead, I will provide general references for them:

- For the **Gaussian Dataset**, it is a synthetic dataset and does not have a specific citation.
- For the **Spheres Dataset**, it is also a synthetic dataset and does not have a specific citation.
- For the **Iris Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. A. Fisher. "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems." Annals of Eugenics, vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 179-188, 1936.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are documented clearly for future reference or processing.
