To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Interactive Machine Learning and the Potential of Cognitive Feedback" by Chris J. Michael, Dina Acklin, and Jaelle Scheuerman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the integration of machine learning in defense applications but does not specify any datasets. The introduction elaborates on interactive machine learning but does not provide specific dataset names either.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly the sections that describe the implementations of interactive machine learning (IML). The paper mentions three specific applications of IML: region digitization, textual translation, and video annotation. I will look for any datasets associated with these applications.

In the section on **region digitization**, the authors reference the **Geospatial Region Application Interface Toolkit (GRAIT)** but do not provide a specific dataset name. However, they mention that the implementation was tested on images of Johnson Lake, WA, which could imply the use of a dataset related to geographic imagery.

In the **textual translation** section, the authors refer to a method that improves machine translation but do not specify a dataset used for this implementation. They mention a study by Gonzlez-Rubio and Casacuberta (2014) that discusses cost-sensitive active learning for computer-assisted translation, but again, no specific dataset is named.

In the **video annotation** section, the authors discuss the **Janelia Automatic Animal Behavior Annotator (JAABA)**, which is used for annotating animal behavior in videos. They cite a study by Kabra et al. (2013) that describes JAABA, which suggests that there is a dataset related to animal behavior videos, but the specific dataset is not detailed in this paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might provide full details about the datasets mentioned. The references include:

1. **Gonzlez-Rubio and Casacuberta (2014)**, which discusses machine translation but does not specify a dataset.
2. **Kabra et al. (2013)**, which describes JAABA and likely references the dataset used for animal behavior annotation.

The citation for the JAABA dataset is:
> Kabra, M., Robie, A. A., Rivera-Alba, M., Branson, S., and Branson, K. (2013). *JAABA: Interactive Machine Learning for Automatic Annotation of Animal Behavior*. Nature Methods, 10(1):64.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names for the other applications, I will note that the datasets for region digitization and textual translation are not specified in this paper.

In summary, I will compile the findings as follows:

1. **JAABA Dataset**: Used for video annotation of animal behavior.
   - Citation: Kabra, M., Robie, A. A., Rivera-Alba, M., Branson, S., and Branson, K. (2013). *JAABA: Interactive Machine Learning for Automatic Annotation of Animal Behavior*. Nature Methods, 10(1):64.

I will now prepare the dataset entry for JAABA and note that no specific datasets were identified for the other applications discussed in the paper.
