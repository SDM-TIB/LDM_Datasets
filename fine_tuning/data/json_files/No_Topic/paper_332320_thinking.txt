To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RouteNet-Erlang: A Graph Neural Network for Network Performance Evaluation" by Miquel Ferriol-Galmés et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that "all datasets, code, and trained models of RouteNet-E used in this paper are publicly available at [17]." This indicates that there are datasets used in the research, and I need to find out more about them.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe how they generated the datasets. In section IV-B, they mention that they used a packet-level network simulator (OMNeT++ v5.5.1) to generate datasets for training, validation, and testing. They specify that the training dataset consists of 200,000 samples from the NSFNET and GEANT topologies, which is crucial information.

I will also look for any specific details about the datasets, such as their characteristics or the types of traffic models used. The authors describe five different traffic models with varying complexity, which are essential for understanding the datasets' context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following:

1. **NSFNET topology**: 
   > "NSFNET (14 nodes)" - The citation for this topology can be found in the references, specifically:
   > > "X. Hei, J. Zhang et al., 'Wavelength converter placement in least-load-routing-based optical networks using genetic algorithms,' Journal of Optical Networking, vol. 3, no. 5, pp. 363–378, 2004."

2. **GEANT topology**: 
   > "GEANT (24 nodes)" - The citation for this topology is:
   > > "F. Barreto et al., 'Fast emergency paths schema to overcome transient link failures in ospf routing,' arXiv preprint arXiv:1204.2465, 2012."

3. **GBN topology**: 
   > "GBN (17 nodes)" - The citation for this topology is:
   > > "J. Pedro, J. Santos, and J. Pires, 'Performance evaluation of integrated otn/dwdm networks with single-stage multiplexing of optical channel data units,' in International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks, 2011, pp. 1–4."

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper references.
