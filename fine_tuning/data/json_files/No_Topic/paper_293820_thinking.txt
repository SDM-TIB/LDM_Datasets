To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WEC: Deriving a Large-scale Cross-document Event Coreference dataset from Wikipedia" by Alon Eirew et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Wikipedia Event Coreference (WEC)** methodology and specifically mentions the **WEC-Eng dataset**, which is a large-scale dataset derived from English Wikipedia for cross-document event coreference. This indicates that the WEC-Eng dataset is a primary focus of the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Related Datasets)**, where the authors discuss existing datasets relevant to cross-document event coreference. They mention three notable datasets:

1. **ECB+**: This dataset is described as the most commonly used for training and testing models for cross-document event coreference. It is referenced as:
   > Cybulska, A., & Vossen, P. (2014). Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Lexical diversity and event coreference resolution. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **MEANTIME**: This dataset is mentioned as similar to ECB+ but with different characteristics. The citation is:
   > Minard, A., Speranza, M., Urizar, R., Altuna, B., van Erp, M., Schoen, A., & van Son, C. (2016). MEANTIME, the NewsReader multilingual event and time corpus. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 4417–4422, Portorož, Slovenia. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

3. **Gun Violence Corpus (GVC)**: This dataset is also discussed, and its citation is:
   > Vossen, P., Ilievski, F., Postma, M., & Segers, R. (2018). Don’t annotate, but validate: a data-to-text method for capturing event data. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

In **section 3 (The WEC Methodology and Dataset)**, the authors detail the creation of the **WEC-Eng dataset**. They describe the methodology used to extract this dataset from Wikipedia, emphasizing its large scale and the types of mentions it includes. The WEC-Eng dataset is the main contribution of the paper, and it is essential to note its characteristics and the fact that it is publicly available.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **WEC-Eng Dataset**: The dataset created using the WEC methodology from English Wikipedia. The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but it is referenced throughout the paper.

2. **ECB+ Dataset**: 
   > Cybulska, A., & Vossen, P. (2014). Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Lexical diversity and event coreference resolution. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14), Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

3. **MEANTIME Dataset**: 
   > Minard, A., Speranza, M., Urizar, R., Altuna, B., van Erp, M., Schoen, A., & van Son, C. (2016). MEANTIME, the NewsReader multilingual event and time corpus. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 4417–4422, Portorož, Slovenia. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

4. **Gun Violence Corpus (GVC)**: 
   > Vossen, P., Ilievski, F., Postma, M., & Segers, R. (2018). Don’t annotate, but validate: a data-to-text method for capturing event data. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

Finally, I will ensure that all the extracted datasets and their citations are presented clearly for any further processing or review.
