To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CycAs: Self-supervised Cycle Association for Learning Re-identifiable Descriptions" by Zhongdao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments are conducted on **seven benchmarks**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in person re-identification and mention the need for effective datasets. I will pay attention to any datasets that are explicitly named or referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they mention testing on both video-based and image-based datasets. I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset is widely used for person re-identification tasks and contains a large number of images and identities.
2. **DukeMTMC-ReID**: Another popular dataset for evaluating person re-identification methods, which includes images from multiple cameras.
3. **CUHK03**: This dataset is also referenced, known for its diverse set of images for person re-identification.
4. **MSMT17**: A dataset that provides a more challenging setting for person re-identification tasks.
5. **MARS**: A video-based dataset specifically designed for person re-identification.
6. **iLIDS**: Another video-based dataset used for evaluating re-identification methods.
7. **PRID2011**: A dataset that includes images from multiple cameras for person re-identification.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
