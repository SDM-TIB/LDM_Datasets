To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recent Advancements in End-to-End Autonomous Driving using Deep Learning" by Pranav Singh Chiba and Pravendra Singh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a summary of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 11 (Datasets and simulator)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the research. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., images, LiDAR), and the context in which they were used.

In this section, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: A well-known dataset for various tasks in autonomous driving, including object detection and tracking.
   - Citation: 
     > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." *The International Journal of Robotics Research* 32.11 (2013): 1231-1237.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**: A dataset that provides a comprehensive set of sensor data for autonomous driving, including camera, LiDAR, and radar data.
   - Citation:
     > Holger Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, O. Beijbom. "nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving." *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (2020): 11621-11631.

3. **ApolloScape Dataset**: A dataset that captures various driving conditions and scenarios for training autonomous driving models.
   - Citation:
     > Xiaozhi Chen, Huimin Ma, and Xiaojun Chang. "The ApolloScape open dataset for autonomous driving and its application." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence* 42.10 (2019): 2702-2719.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
