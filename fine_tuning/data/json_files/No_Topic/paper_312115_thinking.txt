To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Estimating Categorical Counterfactuals via Deep Twin Networks" by Athanasios Vlontzos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically test their approach on "diverse real-world and semi-synthetic data from medicine, epidemiology, and finance." This suggests that there are specific datasets used for these tests.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, they mention using four publicly available datasets:

1. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance in predicting loan risk based on account status. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*, 2017. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

2. **International Stroke Trial (IST)**: This dataset is utilized to assess the effects of antithrombotic therapy after stroke onset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Peter Sandercock and Anna Niewada. *International stroke trial database (version 2)*, Nov 2011. doi: 10.7488/DS/104. URL: https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/128.

3. **Kenyan Water Task**: This dataset investigates the impact of protecting water springs on childhood diarrhea. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Maria Cuellar and Edward H Kennedy. *A non-parametric projection-based estimator for the probability of causation, with application to water sanitation in Kenya*. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A (Statistics in Society), 183(4):1793–1818, 2020.

4. **Twin Mortality Dataset**: This dataset is used to understand the effect of being the heavier twin on mortality after birth. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Christos Louizos, Uri Shalit, Joris Mooij, David Sontag, Richard Zemel, and Max Welling. *Causal effect inference with deep latent-variable models*. In Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 6449–6459, 2017.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note any specific details provided about each dataset, such as the nature of the data, the number of samples, and the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly. This structured approach will help in accurately extracting and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
