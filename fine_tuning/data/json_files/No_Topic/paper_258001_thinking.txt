To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Classifier Mistakes with Generative Models" by LaÃ«titia Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generative models to understand classifier mistakes, which may imply the use of specific datasets for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they tested their approach on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, providing details about the number of classes and the nature of the data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Both datasets are derived from the same technical report, which is important to note.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
