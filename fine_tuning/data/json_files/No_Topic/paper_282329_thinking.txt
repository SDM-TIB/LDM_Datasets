To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generate Natural Language Explanations for Recommendation" by Hanxiong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various e-commerce product domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that their datasets are built upon the **Amazon 5-core dataset**, which includes user-generated reviews and metadata spanning from May 1996 to July 2014. They specifically highlight two subsets: **Electronics** and **Beauty**.

1. **Electronics Dataset**: This dataset contains 45,224 users, 61,687 items, 744,453 reviews, and 434 extracted feature words. The authors note that the dataset is highly sparse.

2. **Beauty Dataset**: This smaller dataset includes 5,122 users, 11,616 items, 90,247 reviews, and 518 extracted feature words. It also has a high sparsity level.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon 5-core dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Hidden factors and hidden topics: understanding rating dimensions with review text*. In Proceedings of the 7th ACM conference on Recommender systems, ACM, 165â€“172, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Electronics Dataset**: Contains user reviews and metadata from Amazon.
- **Beauty Dataset**: Another subset of the Amazon dataset with user reviews and metadata.

I will ensure that the full citation for the Amazon dataset is included in the final output.
