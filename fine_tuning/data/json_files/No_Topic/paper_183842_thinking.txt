To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Inference for On-line Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series" by Maximilian Soelch and Justin Bayer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will focus on the introduction and methodology for more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of anomaly detection in robotic systems and mention the need for training and testing data. They indicate that they recorded joint configurations of a robot arm, which suggests that this data is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section**. Here, the authors specify that they recorded **1008 anomaly-free samples** of a pick-and-place task and **300 samples with anomalies**. This indicates that there are two main datasets involved:

1. **Normal Samples Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1008 samples recorded at 15 Hz during a pick-and-place task with the Baxter Robot arm. The authors describe the nature of the task and the data collection process, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

2. **Anomalous Samples Dataset**: This dataset includes 300 samples with anomalies, which were generated by manually hitting the robot with random commands. The authors provide details on how the anomalies were labeled, which is important for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves and not from external sources, I will note that the citations for these datasets will be based on the paper itself.

The full citation for the datasets is:
> Soelch, M., & Bayer, J. (2016). Variational Inference for On-line Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Time Series. In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. The datasets are:

1. **Normal Samples Dataset**: 1008 samples of robot joint configurations during a pick-and-place task.
2. **Anomalous Samples Dataset**: 300 samples with anomalies generated by manual interventions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
