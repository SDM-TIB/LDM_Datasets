To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Commands for Autonomous Vehicles" by Thierry Deruyttere et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the "Commands for Autonomous Vehicles (C4AV) challenge" and references the "Talk2Car dataset." This suggests that the Talk2Car dataset is a key dataset in this research.

Next, I will examine the **related work** section, specifically **section 2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide an overview of various datasets used for visual grounding tasks. Here, I will look for any additional datasets that might be relevant to the study. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **ReferIt**
2. **RefCOCO**
3. **RefCOCO+**
4. **RefCOCOg**
5. **CLEVR-Ref**
6. **Cityscapes-Ref**
7. **Talk2Car**

The Talk2Car dataset is highlighted as the primary dataset used in the challenge, which is confirmed in **section 3.1 (Dataset)**. The authors describe the Talk2Car dataset in detail, noting that it is built on top of the nuScenes dataset and contains 11,959 text-image pairs.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to find the appropriate citations:

- For the **Talk2Car dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deruyttere, T., Vandenhende, S., Grujicic, D., Van Gool, L., Moens, M.F. (2019). *Talk2car: Taking control of your self-driving car*.

- For the **nuScenes dataset**, the citation is:

  > Yu, L., Poirson, P., Yang, S., Berg, A.C., Berg, T.L. (2016). *Modeling context in referring expressions*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 69–85.

- For the **CLEVR-Ref dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Cityscapes-Ref dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
