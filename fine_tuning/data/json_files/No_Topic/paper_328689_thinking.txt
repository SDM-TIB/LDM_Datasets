To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Invariances and the Low-Rank Phenomenon: Beyond Linear Networks" by Thien Le and Stefanie Jegelka, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the research.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay special attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific attributes that are relevant to the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
