To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Processing Based Scene-Text Detection and Recognition with Tesseract" by Ebin Zacharias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of text recognition in natural images and mentions the use of a camera mounted on a truck to capture images for the project. This indicates that there may be a dataset related to the images collected during the project.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Collection** subsection. Here, the authors describe how images are captured using a USB camera module mounted on a truck. They mention that a dataset of **3000 images** was initially used for testing, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **Testing and Results** section, where the authors mention that the pipeline was tested on **7450 images** after refining their approach. This suggests that there are at least two datasets referenced: one with 3000 images and another with 7450 images.

Now, I need to gather full citations for these datasets. Since the paper does not provide specific references for the datasets, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper. The datasets can be cited as follows:

1. **Dataset of 3000 images**: 
   > Zacharias, E., Teuchler, M., & Bernier, B. (2023). *Image Processing Based Scene-Text Detection and Recognition with Tesseract*. Unpublished dataset used for testing the text recognition system.

2. **Dataset of 7450 images**: 
   > Zacharias, E., Teuchler, M., & Bernier, B. (2023). *Image Processing Based Scene-Text Detection and Recognition with Tesseract*. Unpublished dataset used for further testing and evaluation of the text recognition pipeline.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
