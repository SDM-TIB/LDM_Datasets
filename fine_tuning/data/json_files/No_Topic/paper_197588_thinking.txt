To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WebSets: Extracting Sets of Entities from the Web Using Unsupervised Information Extraction" by Bhavana Dalvi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of acquiring large sets of concept-instance pairs and mention that experiments were conducted on several different HTML corpora. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely involved.

In **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, the authors provide a detailed overview of the datasets used for their experiments. They list several datasets, including:

1. **Toy Apple**: A small dataset created using SEAL queries with "Apple" as both a fruit and a company.
2. **Delicious Sports**: A subset of the DAI-Labor Delicious corpus, focusing on URLs tagged as "sports."
3. **Delicious Music**: Another subset of the DAI-Labor Delicious corpus, focusing on URLs tagged as "music."
4. **CSEAL Useful**: A collection of HTML pages from which CSEAL gathered information about entities in the NELL KB.
5. **ASIA NELL**: A dataset collected using hypernyms associated with entities in the NELL KB as queries for ASIA.
6. **ASIA INT**: A dataset collected using ASIA with category names from the intelligence domain.
7. **Clueweb HPR**: A dataset collected by randomly sampling high pagerank pages in the Clueweb dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are derived from various sources, including the ClueWeb09 dataset and the DAI-Labor Delicious corpus. 

For the **ClueWeb09 dataset**, the citation is:
> Callan, J. "The ClueWeb09 Dataset." Retrieved from http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Data/clueweb09/.

For the **DAI-Labor Delicious corpus**, the citation is:
> Wetzker, R., Zimmermann, C., & Bauckhage, C. "Analyzing Social Bookmarking Systems: A Del.icio.us Cookbook." In Mining Social Data (MSoDa) Workshop Proceedings, ECAI, 2008. Retrieved from http://www.dai-labor.de/en/competence_centers/irml/datasets/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
