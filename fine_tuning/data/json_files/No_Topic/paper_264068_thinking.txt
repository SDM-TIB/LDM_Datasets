To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sim2Real for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth and Segmentation" by Nithin Raghavan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulated data and mentions the need for real data, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of images taken with cameras in the real world, frequently used for depth evaluation. They also mention that it contains ground-truth sparse depth maps and semantic segmentation maps.

2. **VKITTI Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing simulated scenes taken under various conditions (day, night, fog, rain) and includes ground-truth dense depth maps and semantic segmentation maps.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 2013.

- For the **VKITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yohann Cabon, Naila Murray, and Martin Humenberger. *Virtual Kitti 2*. 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
