To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Localize Using a LiDAR Intensity Map" by Ioan Andrei BË†arsan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments over a large-scale dataset, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their dataset collection. They mention that they collected a new dataset comprising over 4,000 km of driving data, which is split into two parts: **Highway-LidarA** and **Misc-LidarB**. 

1. **Highway-LidarA**: This dataset contains over 400 sequences for a total of over 3,000 km of driving for training and validation. A representative subset of 282 km is used for testing, ensuring no geographic overlap between the splits.

2. **Misc-LidarB**: This dataset includes 79 sequences with 200 km of driving data collected in a mix of highway and city environments using a different LiDAR sensor type.

The authors provide a detailed description of how the datasets were collected and the conditions under which they were gathered, which is crucial for understanding their applicability.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are newly collected and not previously published, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, along with the acknowledgment that they are original datasets created by the authors of the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
