To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach to Benchmark the Performance of Mutual Funds in India" by Adit Chopra, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on 139 mutual fund schemes, which suggests that the dataset is related to these funds.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Findings)**, where the author discusses the analysis of 386 mutual fund schemes, narrowing it down to 139 schemes based on specific criteria. This section likely contains detailed information about the datasets used for analysis, including the criteria for selection and the characteristics of the funds.

In **section 8 (Conclusion)**, the author summarizes the findings and may reference the datasets again, reinforcing their significance in the study. I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Dataset of Mutual Fund Schemes**: The paper mentions a total of 386 mutual fund schemes initially considered, which were filtered down to 139 schemes based on specific criteria (e.g., minimum corpus, complete data points). This dataset is crucial for the analysis presented in the paper.

2. **Performance Metrics Dataset**: The paper discusses various performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, Treynor ratio, Information ratio) used to evaluate the mutual funds. While these metrics are not datasets in the traditional sense, they are derived from the dataset of mutual fund schemes and are essential for understanding the analysis.

Next, I will look for full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The references to foundational works on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and mutual fund performance metrics will be particularly important.

Here are the citations I will include:

- For the foundational DEA methodology:
  > Charnes, A., Cooper, W.W., & Rhodes, E. (1978). "Measuring the efficiency of decision making units." *European Journal of Operational Research*, 2, 429-444.

- For the Sharpe ratio:
  > Sharpe, W.F. (1966). "Mutual fund performance." *Journal of Business*, 34, 119-138.

- For the Information ratio:
  > Jensen, M.C. (1968). "The performance of mutual funds in the period 1945-1964." *Journal of Finance*, 23, 389-416.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or presentation in the required format. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant information is included.
