To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Neighbor Style Transfer" by Nick Kolkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the text, along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using **MS-COCO** as a source of content images and **Wikiart** as a source of style images during the training of their model. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

For **Wikiart**, the citation is:
> Elgammal, A., Liu, B., Elhoseiny, M., & Mazzone, M. *Can: A Large-Scale Dataset for Artistic Style Transfer*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.07068, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the datasets from the paper while providing the necessary citations for further reference.
