To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Transport Maps for Distribution Preserving Operations on Latent Spaces of Generative Models" by Eirikur Agustsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses generative models and their operations but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or specific references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. The authors mention using three datasets: **LLD (Large Logo Dataset)**, **LSUN (Large-scale Scene Understanding)**, and **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset)**. 

I will then gather detailed information about each dataset, including the context in which they were used, such as the type of generative model applied and the prior distributions employed. The paper states that the LLD dataset is used with a uniform prior, while LSUN and CelebA datasets are used with Gaussian priors.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations I will extract are:

1. **LLD Dataset**:
   > Alexander Sage, Eirikur Agustsson, Radu Timofte, and Luc Van Gool. *LLD: Large Logo Dataset*. 2017. URL: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/lld/.

2. **LSUN Dataset**:
   > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

3. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
