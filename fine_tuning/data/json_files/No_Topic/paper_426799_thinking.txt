To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TINA: Think, Interaction, and Action Framework for Zero-Shot Vision-Language Navigation" by Dingbang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed TINA framework on the **Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the R2R dataset is described in more detail. In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically state that they conducted experiments on the R2R dataset, confirming its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the R2R dataset. The citation for the R2R dataset is as follows:
> Peter Anderson, Qi Wu, Damien Teney, Jake Bruce, Mark Johnson, Niko Sünderhauf, Ian Reid, Stephen Gould, and Anton Van Den Hengel. *Vision-and-Language Navigation: Interpreting Visually-Grounded Navigation Instructions in Real Environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3674–3683, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the R2R dataset, I will ensure that this dataset is described thoroughly in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the R2R dataset, ensuring that the full citation is included and that it adheres to the required format for clarity and completeness.
