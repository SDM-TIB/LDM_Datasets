To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secure Aggregation is Not Private Against Membership Inference Attacks" by Khac-Hoang Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implications of secure aggregation in federated learning but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction mentions the use of the **ADULT dataset** and the **EMNIST Digits dataset** for experiments, which indicates that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors describe their experimental setup and confirm that they used the **ADULT dataset** and the **EMNIST Digits dataset** for their evaluations. This provides confirmation that these datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ADULT dataset**, the citation is:
   > Becker, B., Kohavi, R. (1996). *Adult*. UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. For the **EMNIST Digits dataset**, the citation is:
   > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., van Schaik, A. (2017). *EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 2921â€“2926.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ADULT dataset**: A dataset containing 30,162 entries with 104 features, used for classification tasks.
- **EMNIST Digits dataset**: A dataset containing 280,000 images of handwritten digits, used for classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
