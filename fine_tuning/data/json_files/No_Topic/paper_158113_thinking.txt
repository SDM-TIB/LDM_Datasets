To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-Scale Land Cover Classification in Gaofen-2 Satellite Imagery" by Xin-Yi Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors established a large-scale land cover classification dataset consisting of 150 Gaofen-2 imageries, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset description section (Section 2)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the **Gaofen Image Dataset (GID)**, which consists of 150 satellite images annotated into five land cover categories: built-up, farmland, forest, meadow, and waters. This section provides essential details about the dataset's composition and its intended use for model training and performance evaluation.

I will also check the **experiments section (Section 4)** to confirm that the dataset is utilized in the experiments, which will further validate its significance in the research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the GID itself, but it does reference the Gaofen-2 satellite imagery, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin. The relevant citation for the Gaofen-2 satellite imagery is:

- For **Gaofen-2 satellite imagery**, the citation is:
  > State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. *Gaofen-2 Satellite Data*. 2014.

Since the dataset is derived from the Gaofen-2 satellite imagery, I will use this citation to represent the dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that all necessary details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
