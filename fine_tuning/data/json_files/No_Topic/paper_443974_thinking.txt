To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Proper Implicit Discretization of the Super-Twisting Controller—without and with Actuator Saturation" by Richard Seeber and Benedikt Andritsch, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the numerical simulations and comparisons, as they are likely to mention any datasets used for validation or testing.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly named or described. If the authors refer to datasets used in their experiments, I will ensure to capture their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I have the correct citation format.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find the original citation for that dataset, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic practice and to facilitate further research by others interested in the datasets used in this study.
