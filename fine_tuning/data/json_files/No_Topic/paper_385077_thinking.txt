To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transferring Learning Trajectories of Neural Networks" by Daiki Chijiwa, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several datasets used in their evaluations:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of 28 × 28 images of handwritten digits, which is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 32 × 32 images across 10 classes, commonly used for training machine learning models.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, providing a more challenging classification task.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1000 classes, used extensively in image recognition tasks.

5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing images of 196 classes of cars, used for fine-grained classification tasks.

6. **CUB-200-2011**: A dataset of images of 200 species of birds, also used for fine-grained classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
