To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signal inference with unknown response: Calibration-uncertainty renormalized estimator" by Sebastian Dorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical example section (Section IV)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe the setup and results of their experiments, which often includes specific datasets or simulated data they utilized.

In the **numerical example section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were generated or sourced. For instance, the authors might describe the signal and noise characteristics, calibration coefficients, and any specific parameters used in their simulations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset or simulation method, I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:

- If they mention a dataset like "NIFTy" or any other specific dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I will also check if there are standard citations available in the literature.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper academic referencing and to facilitate further research by others in the field.
