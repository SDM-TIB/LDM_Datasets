To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Lingual Text-to-Speech Using Multi-Task Learning and Speaker Classifier Joint Training" by Jingzhou Yang and Lei He, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of cross-lingual speech synthesis and mention the use of a multilingual transformer model. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the training corpus. They mention that the training corpus consists of around **700 hours of professional recordings from 14 language locales**, with at least 3 speakers per locale. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the specific names and citations.

The authors also refer to the **VoxCeleb datasets** in the context of the x-vector speaker classifier system. They mention that the x-vector system is trained with VoxCeleb 1 and 2 datasets, which are crucial for understanding the speaker similarity evaluations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For **VoxCeleb 1**, the citation is:
   > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2017, pp. 2616–2620. [Online]. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2017-950

2. For **VoxCeleb 2**, the citation is:
   > J. S. Chung, A. Nagrani, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, 2018, pp. 1086–1090. [Online]. Available: http://dx.doi.org/10.21437/Interspeech.2018-1929

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

- The **training corpus** consists of recordings from 14 language locales, but it does not have a specific citation as it is a compilation of various recordings.
- The **VoxCeleb 1** and **VoxCeleb 2** datasets are explicitly mentioned and cited.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
