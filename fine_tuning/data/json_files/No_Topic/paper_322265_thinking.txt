To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Fewer Annotations: Active Learning via Region Impurity and Prediction Uncertainty for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation" by Binhui Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of domain adaptive semantic segmentation and mentions the use of synthetic datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention adapting segmentation from synthetic images, specifically the **GTAV** and **SYNTHIA** datasets, to the real-world **Cityscapes** dataset. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **GTAV Dataset**: This dataset contains 24,966 images with a resolution of 1914×1052, sharing 19 classes with the Cityscapes dataset.
2. **SYNTHIA Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,400 images with a resolution of 1280×760, sharing 16 classes with Cityscapes.
3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-quality urban scene images with a resolution of 2048×1024, split into 2,975 training images and 500 images for validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GTAV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stephan R. Richter, Vibhav Vineet, Stefan Roth, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for Data: Ground Truth from Computer Games*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 102–118, 2016.

- For **SYNTHIA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > German Ros, Laura Sellart, Joanna Materzynska, David Vazquez, and Antonio M. Lopez. *The SYNTHIA Dataset: A Large Collection of Synthetic Images for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3234–3243, 2016.

- For **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
