To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Bayesian Market Views for Intelligent Asset Allocation" by Frank Z. Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of public mood data for asset allocation, which suggests that there may be datasets related to sentiment analysis or stock market data.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly mention the sources of their data. Here, they state that they obtained historical closing prices and trading volumes from the **Quandl API**, market capitalization data from **Yahoo! Finance**, and sentiment data from **PsychSignal**. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details in the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets' relevance and usage in their analysis. The authors mention that they investigate a window of around 8 years of data, specifically from **2009-10-05 to 2017-06-04**, which provides context for the temporal aspect of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Quandl API**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the Quandl API in the references, but it is a well-known source for financial data. A general citation could be:
   > Quandl. *Quandl API*. Available at: https://www.quandl.com/tools/api

2. **Yahoo! Finance**: Similarly, Yahoo! Finance is a widely used source for financial data, and a general citation could be:
   > Yahoo! Finance. *Yahoo! Finance API*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

3. **PsychSignal**: The authors mention that sentiment data is obtained from PsychSignal. A citation for this source could be:
   > PsychSignal. *PsychSignal Sentiment Data*. Available at: http://psychsignal.com

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately represent each dataset in the required format, including the full citations, to maintain clarity and proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
