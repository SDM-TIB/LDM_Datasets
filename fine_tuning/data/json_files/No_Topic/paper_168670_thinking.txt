To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Network with Word Embeddings for Chinese Word Segmentation" by Chunqi Wang and Bo Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on two benchmark datasets: **PKU** and **MSR**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to gather more details about these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluate their model on the **PKU** and **MSR** datasets, which are from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the bakeoff, which is a common source for these datasets. Therefore, I will cite the bakeoff paper as the authoritative source for both datasets.

The citation for the **PKU dataset** is:
> Thomas Emerson. *The second international Chinese word segmentation bakeoff*. In Proceedings of the fourth SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language Processing, volume 133, 2005.

The citation for the **MSR dataset** is the same as it is part of the same bakeoff:
> Thomas Emerson. *The second international Chinese word segmentation bakeoff*. In Proceedings of the fourth SIGHAN workshop on Chinese language Processing, volume 133, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
