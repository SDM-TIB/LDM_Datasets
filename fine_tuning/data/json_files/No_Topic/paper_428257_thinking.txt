To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Case Studies of AI Policy Development in Africa" by Kadijatou Diallo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of AI readiness in African nations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to assessments or surveys conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** where the authors analyze four African countries: Mauritius, Egypt, Kenya, and Angola. I will look for any specific datasets or assessments mentioned in relation to these countries. For instance, the authors reference the **Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness Index** and the **Stanford HAI AI Index**, which are likely to be datasets used for their analysis.

In the **indicators section**, the authors discuss various frameworks and assessments, including the **OECD Digital Government Policy Framework** and the **Cisco AI Readiness Index**. I will note these as they may contain relevant datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **Oxford Insights Government AI Readiness Index**:
   > Rogerson, A., Hankins, E., Nettel, P. F., and Rahim, S. (2022). *Government AI Readiness Index 2022*. Technical report, Oxford Insights. Retrieved from [URL].

2. **Stanford HAI AI Index**:
   > Maslej, N., Fattorini, L., Brynjolfsson, E., Etchemendy, J., Ligett, K., Lyons, T., Manyika, J., Ngo, H., Niebles, J. C., Parli, V., Shoham, Y., Wald, R., Clark, J., and Perrault, R. (2023). *The AI Index 2023 Annual Report*. Technical report, Stanford University. Retrieved from [URL].

5. **Global Data Barometer**:
   > Global Data Barometer (2023). *Global Data Barometer*. Retrieved from [URL].

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
