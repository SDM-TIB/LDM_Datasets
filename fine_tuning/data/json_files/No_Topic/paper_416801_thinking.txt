To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Assessment of Studentsâ€™ Code Comprehension using LLMs" by Priti Oli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on using LLMs for automated assessment, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention using **CodeCorpus** for their analysis. They describe it as a dataset developed to understand how learners explain code, consisting of pairs of code snippets, expert explanations, and student explanations for ten different code examples. This section provides a clear indication that CodeCorpus is the primary dataset utilized in their research.

I will also note that the authors collected student explanations using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and that expert explanations were sourced from a curated collection of annotated examples. However, the specific dataset name remains CodeCorpus.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the CodeCorpus dataset. Unfortunately, the paper does not provide a direct citation for CodeCorpus, as it appears to be a dataset developed by the authors themselves. In this case, I will note that the dataset is referenced in the context of their work but lacks a formal citation.

To summarize, I will create an entry for the dataset as follows:

1. **CodeCorpus**: This dataset is used to analyze how learners explain code, consisting of pairs of code snippets, expert explanations, and student explanations. It was collected through MTurk and is part of a broader project aimed at understanding code comprehension.

Since there is no formal citation for CodeCorpus in the references, I will indicate that it is a dataset developed by the authors for their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily accessed or utilized in subsequent analyses or applications.
