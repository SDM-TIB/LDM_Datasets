To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Accurate Inversion of Multiple Scattering with Deep Learning" by Yu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on both simulated and experimental datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental validation section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their results. Here, they mention two types of datasets:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors describe two simulated datasets consisting of images with non-trivial features. They mention that each dataset contains 1548 images, separated into training, validation, and testing sets. This dataset is generated using a high-fidelity simulation of multiple scattering.

2. **Experimental Dataset**: The authors refer to a public dataset provided by the Fresnel Institute, which consists of experimental microwave measurements of scattered electric fields from 2D targets made of foam and plastic cylinders.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **simulated datasets**, since they are generated by the authors, there may not be a formal citation. However, I will note the details provided in the paper, including the number of images and the conditions under which they were generated.

- For the **experimental dataset**, the citation is:
  > J.-M. Geffrin, P. Sabouroux, and C. Eyraud. "Free space experimental scattering database continuation: experimental set-up and measurement precision." *Inverse Problems*, vol. 21, no. 6, pp. S117â€“S130, 2005.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: Contains 1548 images, with 1500 for training, 24 for validation, and 24 for testing. The images are generated under specific conditions related to multiple scattering.

2. **Experimental Dataset**: This dataset includes experimental microwave measurements from 2D targets consisting of foam and plastic cylinders, with the citation provided above.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations.
