To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Classifiers for Audio Impairments with Noisy Labels" by Chandan K A Reddy, Ross Cutler, and Johannes Gehrke, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for a reliable audio impairment classifier and hints at the use of a large audio dataset, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Audio dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset they created for their experiments. They mention that they created a dataset of **5000 audio clips** uniformly distributed across five classes: four impairment classes (Background noise, Reverberation, Speech distortion, Low volume) and one no-impairment class (clean speech). This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of clips, average clip length, and the distribution of clean speech clips by gender.

Additionally, I will note the methods used to synthesize the audio clips, such as adding background noise at various SNR levels and simulating speech distortion using the Test Authoring and Execution Framework (TAEF). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

In **section 3 (Online evaluation and noisy labels)**, the authors discuss how they labeled the clips using human judges and online platforms like Microsoft’s Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS) and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. This indicates that the dataset includes human-annotated labels, which adds another layer of detail to the dataset description.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the audio dataset they created, as it appears to be a novel dataset synthesized by the authors themselves.

Since the dataset is original and created for the purpose of this research, I will note that the full citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Reddy, C. K. A., Cutler, R., & Gehrke, J. (2023). Supervised Classifiers for Audio Impairments with Noisy Labels. Microsoft Corporation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation for clarity and completeness.
