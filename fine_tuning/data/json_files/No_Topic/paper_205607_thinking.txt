To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Role of Awareness and Universal Context in a Spiking Conscious Neural Network (SCNN): A New Perspective and Future Directions" by Ahsan Adeel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention using the **AV ChiME3 corpus** for their experiments related to audio-visual speech processing. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also look for any **case studies** or specific examples provided in the paper that might reference additional datasets. In this case, the authors discuss using the AV ChiME3 corpus, which is developed by mixing clean Grid videos with ChiME3 noises for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This indicates that the dataset is specifically tailored for studying audio-visual speech processing in noisy environments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AV ChiME3 corpus. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and understanding the dataset's origin. The relevant citation is:

- For **AV ChiME3 corpus**:
  > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. *The third chimespeech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines*. In Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), 2015 IEEE Workshop on, pages 504â€“511, IEEE, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
