To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Photometric Multi-View Mesh Refinement for High-Resolution Satellite Images" by Mathias Rothermel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments with "two different datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges and advancements in 3D surface reconstruction from satellite imagery, but it does not specify the datasets used.

I will then focus on the **results** section, particularly **section 4.1 (Test Sites)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They describe two test sites:

1. **Downtown Jacksonville (JAX), FL, USA**: This site features 26 images of an urban area collected between October 2014 and February 2016.
2. **University of California San Diego (UCSD), CA, USA**: This site consists of 35 images collected between October 2015 and August 2017.

In this section, the authors also mention that a 2.5D LiDAR Digital Surface Model (DSM) with 0.5m GSD is provided as ground truth for both test sites. This indicates that the LiDAR DSM is another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used, but I can infer the following:

- For the **LiDAR DSM**, I will reference the original source of the LiDAR data if available. However, since the paper does not specify a citation, I will note that it is a commonly used dataset in the field.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where applicable. 

1. **Downtown Jacksonville (JAX) Dataset**: 
   - Description: A collection of 26 images of an urban area.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **University of California San Diego (UCSD) Dataset**: 
   - Description: A collection of 35 images covering an area of approximately 600m x 600m.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

3. **LiDAR DSM**: 
   - Description: A 2.5D Digital Surface Model with 0.5m GSD, provided as ground truth for both test sites.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring that I highlight the importance of including full citations for each dataset, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. This will help maintain academic rigor and provide proper attribution for the datasets used in the research.
