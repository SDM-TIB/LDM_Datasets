To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel AI-enabled Framework to Diagnose Coronavirus COVID-19 using Smartphone Embedded Sensors: Design Study" by Halgurd S. Maghdid et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a framework for diagnosing COVID-19 using smartphone sensors, which suggests that there may be data collected from these sensors.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section** where the authors describe how they collect data using smartphone sensors. They mention capturing various types of data, including CT images, temperature readings, and audio samples of coughs. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific datasets that are referenced or analyzed. The authors may provide details about the data collected, such as the number of samples, types of measurements, and any preprocessing steps taken.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets used in their experiments. This is crucial for obtaining full citations for each dataset mentioned.

From my reading, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **CT Scan Images Dataset**: This dataset consists of CT images captured from patients suspected of having COVID-19. The authors mention that these images are used to analyze the severity of pneumonia.

2. **Temperature Sensor Readings Dataset**: This dataset includes temperature readings collected from users' smartphones to monitor fever levels, which is a common symptom of COVID-19.

3. **Cough Sound Samples Dataset**: This dataset comprises audio recordings of cough sounds captured using the smartphone's microphone, which can be analyzed to detect cough patterns associated with COVID-19.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For the **CT Scan Images Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. Lin, Y. Ding, B. Xie, Z. Sun, X. Li, Z. Chen, and M. Niu. *Asymptomatic novel coronavirus pneumonia patient outside Wuhan: The value of CT images in the course of the disease*. Clinical Imaging, 2020.

- For the **Temperature Sensor Readings Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Maddah and B. Beigzadeh. *Use of a smartphone thermometer to monitor thermal conductivity changes in diabetic foot ulcers: a pilot study*. Journal of Wound Care, vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 61–66, 2020.

- For the **Cough Sound Samples Dataset**, the citation is:
  > E. Nemati, M. M. Rahman, V. Nathan, K. Vatanparvar, and J. Kuang. *A comprehensive approach for cough type detection*. In 2019 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Connected Health: Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE). IEEE, 2019, pp. 15–16.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
