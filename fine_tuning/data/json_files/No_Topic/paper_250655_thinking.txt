To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Learned Frame-Prediction Compete with Block-Motion Compensation for Video Coding?" by Serkan Sulun and A. Murat Tekalp, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **10 MPEG test videos**, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. In **section 3.2.1 (Training Dataset)**, the authors describe their training dataset as consisting of **two million gray-level patch sequences extracted from the UCF101 dataset**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training process of their model.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. In **section 5 (Evaluation and Results)**, the authors refer to the **10 MPEG test sequences** used for evaluation. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **UCF101 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402.

2. For the **MPEG test videos**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation for these videos, they are commonly used in video coding research. I will note that they are standard test sequences in the field.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
