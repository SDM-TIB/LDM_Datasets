To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exercise Hierarchical Feature Enhanced Knowledge Tracing" by Hanshuang Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a framework for knowledge tracing but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the importance of knowledge tracing in educational systems, which suggests that datasets related to student performance may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They state that there is no open dataset available that provides exercise records with text information. Instead, they derived an experimental dataset from a real-world online education system, specifically **aixuexi.com**. This indicates that the dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, but it is still crucial to document it.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Derived dataset from aixuexi.com
- **Description**: Contains 132,179 students and 91,449,914 answer records, which are used to evaluate their proposed framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a proprietary source, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from a specific online education platform without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details. The citation for the dataset will be noted as:
- **Dataset Citation**: No formal citation available; derived from aixuexi.com.

This process ensures that I accurately capture the dataset information while adhering to the importance of full citations where applicable.
