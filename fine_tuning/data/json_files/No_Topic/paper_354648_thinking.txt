To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ArgLegalSumm: Improving Abstractive Summarization of Legal Documents with Argument Mining" by Mohamed Elaraby and Diane Litman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of argument role labeling into the summarization process, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction references several large-scale datasets used in prior research, such as CNN-DailyMail, PubMed, and New York Times, but again does not specify any datasets used in this study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Methods)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that their dataset consists of **1049 legal cases and summary pairs**, which were obtained through an agreement with the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). They also provide information about how the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

The dataset is annotated with argument roles, which are crucial for their summarization technique. The authors specify that the argument roles are based on the IRC taxonomy, which includes Issues, Reasons, and Conclusions. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the data was obtained from CanLII, which is a legal information institute. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from legal cases available through CanLII.

Since there is no formal citation provided for the dataset in the paper, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Legal Cases Dataset**: A dataset composed of 1049 legal cases and summary pairs, annotated with argument roles (Issues, Reasons, Conclusions). The dataset was obtained through an agreement with the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII).

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

In conclusion, while the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, it is important to acknowledge the source (CanLII) and the nature of the dataset used in the research.
