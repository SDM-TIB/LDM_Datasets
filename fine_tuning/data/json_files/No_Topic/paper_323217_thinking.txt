To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Differential Property Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach to Experimental Design in Advanced Manufacturing" by Loc Truong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of a machine learning framework (DPC) on a specific manufacturing process, which suggests that there may be relevant datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe their methodology and the data used. They mention that they demonstrate the DPC framework on a dataset consisting of mechanical property data from **20 experiments of AA7075 tubes synthesized using Shear Assisted Processing and Extrusion (ShAPE)**. This indicates that the dataset is related to the manufacturing process of aluminum 7075 tubes.

In the **training and test set section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that the dataset comprises measurements from **20 distinct ShAPE experiments**, with various process parameters and mechanical properties measured. This includes parameters like mechanical power, extrusion torque, and extrusion temperature, as well as properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and yield strength.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** of the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the ShAPE process in their work, and I will need to find the original papers that describe this dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For the ShAPE process and the dataset used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > Whalen, S.; Olszta, M.; Reza-E-Rabby, M.; Roosendaal, T.; Wang, T.; Herling, D.; Taysom, B. S.; Sufﬁeld, S.; and Overman, N. (2021a). *High speed manufacturing of aluminum alloy 7075 tubing by Shear Assisted Processing and Extrusion (ShAPE)*. Journal of Manufacturing Processes, 71: 699–710.

- Additionally, another relevant citation for the ShAPE process is:
  > Whalen, S.; Reza-E-Rabby, M.; Wang, T.; Ma, X.; Roosendaal, T.; Herling, D.; Overman, N.; and Taysom, B. S. (2021b). *Shear Assisted Processing and Extrusion of Aluminum Alloy 7075 Tubing at High Speed*. In Light Metals 2021, 277–280.

With these citations, I have gathered the necessary information about the dataset used in the research. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
