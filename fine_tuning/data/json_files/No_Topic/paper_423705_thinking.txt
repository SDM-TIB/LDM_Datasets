To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A mathematical model for simultaneous personnel shift planning and unrelated parallel machine scheduling" by Maziyar Khadivi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a production scheduling problem and mentions validation with synthetic problem instances and a real industrial case study. This indicates that there may be datasets related to these instances.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to specific datasets. The introduction discusses various scheduling problems and mentions the use of a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model, but does not explicitly name any datasets.

I will then look into **section 5 (Computational experiments)**, where the authors describe the generation of synthetic problem instances. Here, they mention that the instances are generated with input parameters for the number of jobs, machines, time periods, and personnel capacity. This section is likely to contain details about the datasets used for the experiments.

In **section 5.1**, the authors state that they generated 118 synthetic problem instances with various combinations of jobs, machines, and personnel. They also mention that the data generation software is publicly available on GitHub, which is a crucial piece of information for citation purposes. The specific dataset used for the synthetic instances is not named, but the authors provide a link to the software that generates these datasets.

In **section 5.2 (Case study)**, the authors describe a real-world application involving a food processing plant. They provide details about the jobs, machines, and personnel involved in the case study, which can be considered a dataset. The parameters for this case study are summarized in a table, which includes the number of jobs, machines, personnel, and their respective processing times and setup times.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

1. **Synthetic Problem Instances**: The dataset is generated using a software tool available at:
   > GitHub Repository: https://github.com/tcharte/Machine-Scheduling-Data-Generator (Accessed January 15, 2024).

2. **Case Study Dataset**: The details of the case study dataset are derived from the research paper itself, which does not provide a formal citation for the dataset but describes it as follows:
   > Khadivi, M., Abbasi, M., Charter, T., & Najjaran, H. (2024). A mathematical model for simultaneous personnel shift planning and unrelated parallel machine scheduling. *Journal of Manufacturing Systems*. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in future research or applications.
