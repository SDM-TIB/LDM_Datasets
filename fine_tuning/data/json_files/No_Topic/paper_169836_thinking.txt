To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indirect Image Registration with Large Diffeomorphic Deformations" by Chong Chen and Ozan Ã–ktem, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section often includes specific names, characteristics, and the context in which the datasets were used.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional references to datasets, particularly if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets or compare results across different datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to image registration, tomography, or any other relevant applications mentioned in the text. 

Once I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the dataset names, descriptions, and citations clearly and accurately.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for presentation or further analysis, adhering to any specific formatting guidelines if provided.
