To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean Aggregator Is More Robust Than Robust Aggregators Under Label Poisoning Attacks" by Jie Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will pay special attention to the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **CIFAR10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose in the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose, and the corresponding citation.

This process ensures that I have thoroughly extracted the relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through accurate citations.
