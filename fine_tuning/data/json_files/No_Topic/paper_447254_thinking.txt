To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Naturally Occurring Feedback" by Shachar Don-Yehiya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to over 1 million conversations, which suggests a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Automatically Extracting Feedback)**, where the authors mention using the **LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset**. This dataset is described as a collection of real-world conversations with 25 state-of-the-art language models, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In **section 5.3 (The Natural Feedback Dataset)**, the authors detail how they created a large dataset of naturally occurring feedback by extracting feedback samples from the LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset. They report obtaining 173,859 feedback examples from 334,319 conversations, which further emphasizes the significance of this dataset in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Lianmin Zheng, Wei-Lin Chiang, Ying Sheng, Tianle Li, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhanghao Wu, Yonghao Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Dacheng Li, Eric P. Xing, Joseph E. Gonzalez, and Ion Stoica. *LMSYS-Chat-1M: A Large-Scale Real-World LLM Conversation Dataset*. Preprint, arXiv:2309.11998, 2023.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entry. The key dataset identified is the **LMSYS-Chat-1M dataset**, which is central to the research presented in the paper.

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:
1. **LMSYS-Chat-1M Dataset**: A large-scale dataset of real-world conversations used to extract naturally occurring feedback.

Finally, I will ensure that the full citation is included for the dataset to maintain proper academic referencing.
