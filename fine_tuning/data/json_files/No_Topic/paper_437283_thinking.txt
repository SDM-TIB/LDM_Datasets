To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Representation Genetic Programming: A Case Study on Tree-based and Linear Representations" by Zhixing Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of instances, features, or specific characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two applications: **symbolic regression** and **dynamic job shop scheduling (DJSS)**. I will look for datasets related to these applications. For symbolic regression, they refer to several benchmarks, including:

1. **Nguyen4**: A synthetic benchmark function.
2. **Keijzer11**: Another synthetic benchmark function.
3. **Airfoil**: A real-world dataset.
4. **BHouse**: A real-world dataset.
5. **Tower**: A real-world dataset.
6. **Concrete**: A real-world dataset.
7. **Redwine**: A real-world dataset.

For DJSS, the authors describe the simulation settings and the nature of the job shop problems but do not specify a dataset in the traditional sense. Instead, they outline the parameters and characteristics of the jobs and machines involved in the scheduling problems.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations may not always be explicitly listed as datasets but could be found in the context of the benchmarks used for evaluation.

For the datasets related to symbolic regression, I will look for the following citations:

- For **Nguyen4** and **Keijzer11**, I will refer to the original papers that introduced these benchmarks.
- For **Airfoil**, **BHouse**, **Tower**, **Concrete**, and **Redwine**, I will also find the respective papers or sources that describe these datasets.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
