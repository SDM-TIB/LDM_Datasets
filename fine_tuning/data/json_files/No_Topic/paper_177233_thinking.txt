To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risk-Sensitive Learning and Pricing for Demand Response" by Kia Khezeli and Eilyan Bitar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of data sources in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss the modeling of demand response and the parameters involved, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets used for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, they will likely provide full citations in this section.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets by name. Instead, they describe a theoretical framework and model parameters without referencing specific empirical datasets. However, they do mention that their analysis is based on simulated data derived from certain assumptions about customer behavior and demand response.

Since no specific datasets are cited, I will note this in my findings. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, as this is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings regarding the absence of specific datasets in the paper and document that the authors rely on theoretical modeling rather than empirical datasets for their analysis.
