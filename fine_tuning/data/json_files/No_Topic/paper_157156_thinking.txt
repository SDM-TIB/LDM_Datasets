To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Projection-Free Online Optimization with Stochastic Gradient: From Convexity to Submodularity" by Lin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets they used for testing their algorithms. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." If such a section exists, it will likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Jester dataset** for joke recommendations, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation for the Jester dataset is:
> Goldberg, K., Roeder, T., Gupta, D., & Perkins, C. (2001). EigenTaste: A constant time collaborative filtering algorithm. *Information Retrieval*, 4(2), 133-151.

Similarly, if they mention the **Reuters-21578 dataset** for topic summarization, I will find its citation, which is:
> El-Arini, K., Veda, G., Shahaf, D., & Guestrin, C. (2009). Turning down the noise in the blogosphere. In *SIGKDD*, pp. 289-298. ACM.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with proper references for further exploration.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
