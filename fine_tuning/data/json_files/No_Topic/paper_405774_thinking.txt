To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metrically Scaled Monocular Depth Estimation through Sparse Priors for Underwater Robots" by Luca Ebner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is trained and evaluated on the **FLSea dataset** and also mentions a dataset collected from a coral reef survey. This gives me a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **experiments sections** to gather more details about these datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges of underwater imaging and the need for accurate depth measurements, which sets the context for the datasets used.

In **section IV (Experiments)**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **FLSea Dataset**: This dataset consists of 22,451 image frames with RGB and metric ground truth depth data collected at 12 different underwater locations. The authors specify that they used 10 locations for training and 2 for testing. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and they reference it as [6].

2. **LizardIsland Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of images from a coral reef survey conducted with a diver-operated camera rig. It includes 2,216 sequential images and is used to evaluate the method's generalization to different underwater environments. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the text, but it is important to note its significance in their evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **FLSea dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Randall and T. Treibitz, “FLSea: Underwater visual-inertial and stereo-vision forward-looking datasets,” 2023.

- The **LizardIsland dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the paper, but it is important to note that it was collected by the authors themselves during their research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **FLSea Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 22,451 image frames with RGB and metric ground truth depth data collected at 12 underwater locations. 
   - Citation: Y. Randall and T. Treibitz, “FLSea: Underwater visual-inertial and stereo-vision forward-looking datasets,” 2023.

2. **LizardIsland Dataset**: A dataset collected from a coral reef survey using a diver-operated camera rig, containing 2,216 sequential images. 
   - Note: No formal citation provided; dataset collected by the authors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are accurate and complete.
