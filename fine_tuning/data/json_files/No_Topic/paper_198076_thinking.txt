To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CONATION: English Command Input/Output System for Computers" by Kamlesh Sharma and Dr. T. V. Prasad, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides an overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the need for speech recognition systems but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their training and recognition processes, mentioning that they used data from **20 users** for training and recognition experiments. However, they do not specify any formal datasets or publicly available datasets used for training the speech recognition system.

I will also check the **tables** presented in the experimental results. The tables provide recognition results based on user experiments but do not reference any external datasets. Instead, they seem to rely on the data collected from the users during the training phase.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that the authors primarily used their own collected data from user experiments rather than any publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered. Since there are no formal datasets with citations to include, I will note that the data used for training and testing was collected from the authors' own experiments with 20 users, and no external datasets were referenced.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: User Collected Data
  - **Description**: Data collected from 20 users for training and recognition experiments in the speech recognition system.
  - **Citation**: Not applicable, as no external datasets were referenced.

This approach ensures that I accurately reflect the content of the paper while adhering to the requirement for full citations, even if the datasets are not formally cited in the traditional sense.
