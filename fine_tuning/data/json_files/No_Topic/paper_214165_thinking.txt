To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "Unsupervised training of neural mask-based beamforming" by Lukas Drude et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to two datasets: **CHiME 4** and **REVERB**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to gather more information about these datasets. In section 9 (Evaluation), the authors explicitly mention that they evaluate their method on two distinct databases: one primarily affected by noise (CHiME 4) and the other by reverberation (REVERB). This confirms that both datasets are indeed used for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

1. For the **CHiME 4 dataset**, the citation is:
   > E. Vincent, S. Watanabe, A. A. Nugraha, J. Barker, and R. Marxer. *An analysis of environment, microphone and data simulation mismatches in robust speech recognition*. Computer Speech & Language, 2016.

2. For the **REVERB dataset**, the citation is:
   > K. Kinoshita, M. Delcroix, T. Yoshioka, T. Nakatani, A. Sehr, W. Kellermann, and R. Maas. *The reverb challenge: A common evaluation framework for dereverberation and recognition of reverberant speech*. In IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA), IEEE, 2013, pp. 1â€“4.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **CHiME 4**: A dataset primarily used for evaluating speech recognition systems in noisy environments.
- **REVERB**: A dataset designed for evaluating dereverberation and recognition of reverberant speech.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
