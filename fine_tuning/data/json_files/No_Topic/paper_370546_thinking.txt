To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Approximate Method for Online Convolutional Dictionary Learning" by Farshad G. Veshki and Sergiy A. Vorobyov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experimental evaluations using several image datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Fruit Dataset**: Composed of 10 images of size 100 × 100, typically used as a benchmark for convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and convolutional dictionary learning (CDL).
   
2. **City Dataset**: Similar to the Fruit dataset, it also consists of 10 images of size 100 × 100 and is used for benchmarking CSC and CDL.

3. **SIPI Dataset**: Contains 20 training images and 5 test images, all of size 256 × 256, collected from the USC-SIPI image database.

4. **Flicker Dataset**: Composed of 40 training images and 5 test images, all of size 256 × 256, collected from the MIRFLICKR-1M image dataset.

5. **Flicker-large Dataset**: A larger dataset composed of 1000 training images, all of size 256 × 256, also collected from the MIRFLICKR-1M image dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves are often not cited in the same way as academic papers. Instead, I will note the sources provided in the text:

- For the **SIPI Dataset**, the source is:
  > USC-SIPI Image Database. Available at: http://sipi.usc.edu/database/

- For the **Flicker Dataset**, the source is:
  > MIRFLICKR-1M Image Dataset. Available at: https://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirdownload.html

The Fruit and City datasets are commonly used benchmarks in the field, but specific citations may not be provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant details and sources for each dataset as outlined in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
