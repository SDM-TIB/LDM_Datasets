To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Rigorous Study of Integrated Gradients Method and Extensions to Internal Neuron Attributions" by Daniel Lundstrom et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections**. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 7 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using two models/data sets: **ResNet-152 trained on ImageNet** and a **custom model trained on Fashion MNIST**. This indicates that both datasets are relevant to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will gather full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

2. **Fashion MNIST**: The citation for the Fashion MNIST dataset is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the details of each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
