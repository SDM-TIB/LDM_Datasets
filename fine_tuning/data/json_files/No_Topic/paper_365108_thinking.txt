To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Eluder-based Regret for Stochastic Contextual MDPs" by Orin Levy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. These sections often provide a summary of the work and may highlight key datasets used in the research. If the abstract mentions any datasets, I will note them down.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any subsections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as they are likely to contain the most relevant information.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. If the authors refer to datasets by name, I will make sure to note those names.

After identifying the datasets, I will then check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For this specific paper, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of reinforcement learning or contextual Markov decision processes, as these are the main themes of the research. If the paper discusses any datasets used for training or evaluation, I will extract their names and descriptions.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly, making it easy to understand and reference in future work or discussions.
