To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two beams are better than one: Towards Reliable and High Throughput mmWave Links" by Ish Kumar Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of experiments or evaluations. For instance, if the authors refer to a specific dataset used for testing their mmWave system, I will note down its name and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "mmReliable Testbed Data," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is derived from a previous study, I will ensure to cite the original source accurately.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
