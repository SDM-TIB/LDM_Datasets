To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerated First Order Methods for Variational Imaging" by Joseph Bartlett, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a concise summary of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Smooth Optimisation - Tikhonov Denoising)** and **section 5 (Non-Smooth Optimisation - Total Variation (TV) Denoising)**. These sections often detail the experiments conducted and the datasets utilized for validation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments** or **results** sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including any performance metrics or comparisons made using these datasets. If the paper includes a **results** section, it may summarize the findings based on the datasets used, which will be crucial for understanding their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section for full citations. This is essential as it provides the necessary context and acknowledgment for each dataset. I will ensure to extract the complete citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "FastMRI dataset," I will look for its citation in the references section, which might look like this:
> Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., et al. (2018). FastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
