To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Transformer: Predicting Samples of Unseen, Future Domains" by Johannes Schneider, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **evaluation section** where the author discusses the performance of their method on these datasets. The paper mentions that they evaluate their approach on both the MNIST dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset, confirming their relevance to the experiments conducted.

In the **data and transformations section**, the author provides additional details about the datasets used. It states that both datasets were scaled from 28x28 to 32x32, and it describes the transformations applied to the datasets, such as rotation and zooming. This section reinforces the significance of the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets in the context of the research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically:

- For the MNIST dataset:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the Fashion-MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
