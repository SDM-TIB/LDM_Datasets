To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SENSEI: Sensitive Set Invariance for Enforcing Individual Fairness" by Mikhail Yurochkin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three ML tasks susceptible to algorithmic bias, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on three tasks: **toxic comment detection**, **occupation prediction**, and **income prediction**. Each task likely corresponds to a specific dataset.

1. **Toxic Comment Classification**: The authors mention using the dataset from the "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge" on Kaggle. This dataset is specifically designed for identifying toxic comments in online conversations.

2. **Bias in Bios Dataset**: For the occupation prediction task, the authors refer to the "Bias in Bios" dataset, which consists of 400,000 textual bio descriptions aimed at predicting occupations.

3. **Adult Dataset**: The authors also mention the "Adult" dataset, which is a well-known benchmark in the group fairness literature for predicting income levels based on demographic information.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Adult dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
