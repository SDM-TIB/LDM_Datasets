To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tiny Obstacle Discovery by Occlusion-aware Multilayer Regression" by Feng Xue, Anlong Ming, and Yu Zhou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments are conducted on **two datasets**, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically refer to the **Lost and Found dataset (LAFD)** and the **Marine Obstacle Detection dataset (MODDv2)**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset.

1. **Lost and Found Dataset (LAFD)**: The paper describes this dataset as the only publicly available dataset focusing on discovering small obstacles and lost cargo on roads. It contains 1,036 images in the training/validation set and 1,068 images in the testing set, with various challenging street scenarios.

2. **Marine Obstacle Detection Dataset (MODDv2)**: This dataset is characterized as a realistic, publicly available dataset for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). It includes 28 video sequences with a total of 11,675 frames, annotated with polygons for water and bounding boxes for obstacles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Lost and Found dataset (LAFD)**, the citation is:
  > P. Pinggera, S. Ramos, S. Gehrig, U. Franke, C. Rother, and R. Mester. *Lost and found: detecting small road hazards for self-driving vehicles*. In IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2016.

- For the **Marine Obstacle Detection dataset (MODDv2)**, the citation is:
  > B. Bovcon, R. Mandeljc, J. Perš, and M. Kristan. *Stereo obstacle detection for unmanned surface vehicles by IMU-assisted semantic segmentation*. Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 104, pp. 1–13, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
