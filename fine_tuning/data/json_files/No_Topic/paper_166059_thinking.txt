To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symmetry, Saddle Points, and Global Optimization Landscape of Nonconvex Matrix Factorization" by X. Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and related work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. If the paper includes a section specifically titled "Datasets" or similar, I will focus on that section for detailed information.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for experiments, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation that typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate for future use.
