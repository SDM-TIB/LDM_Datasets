To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Textual Entailment with Structured Attentions and Composition" by Kai Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning techniques for textual entailment but does not specify any datasets. I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various methods and previous works but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Empirical Evaluations)**, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on the **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset**. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being used for their experiments. They describe the SNLI dataset as containing **570k sentence pairs**, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SNLI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **SNLI dataset**:
  > Samuel R. Bowman, Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. *A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 632â€“642, Lisbon, Portugal, September. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset**: Contains 570k sentence pairs used for evaluating the model's performance on the textual entailment task.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
