To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Biologically-Motivated Deep Learning Method using Hierarchical Competitive Learning" by Takashi Shinozaki, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated using several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the author explicitly mentions three datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for verifying the proposed method's adaptation to complex tasks. It is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

2. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms. The author mentions using a LeNet5-like network for this dataset.

3. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes and is also a standard benchmark in image classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., and Berg, A.C. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Barges, C.J.C. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the datasets and their citations from the paper, which is crucial for proper referencing and validation in future research or applications.
