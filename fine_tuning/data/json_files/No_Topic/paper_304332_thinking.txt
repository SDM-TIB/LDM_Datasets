To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Deepfake Videos Using Long Distance Attention" by Wei Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on different public datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **FaceForensics++ (FF++)**: This dataset consists of four kinds of face forgery videos generated by four state-of-the-art methods. It is widely used in face forgery detection research.

2. **Celeb-DF**: This dataset contains over 5000 deepfake videos, with real videos gathered from social media. It is noted for its challenge due to the high realism of the generated videos.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FaceForensics++**, the citation is:
  > A. Rössler, D. Cozzolino, L. Verdoliva, C. Riess, J. Thies, and M. Niessner. *FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, Seoul, Korea (South), 2019, pp. 1–11.

- For **Celeb-DF**, the citation is:
  > Y. Li, X. Yang, P. Sun, H. Qi, and S. Lyu. *Celeb-df: A Large-Scale Challenging Dataset for Deepfake Forensics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Seattle, USA, 2020, pp. 3204–3213.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets used in the research.
