To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post-Regularization Inference for Time-Varying Nonparanormal Graphical Models" by Junwei Lu, Mladen Kolar, and Han Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. This section typically outlines the context and significance of the research, and authors often reference datasets that are foundational to their work.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss experiments or data analysis. This is where the authors are likely to detail the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results** section, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss the outcomes of their analyses in relation to specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Penn Action Dataset** and the **ADHD-200 dataset**, I will look for their full citations in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
