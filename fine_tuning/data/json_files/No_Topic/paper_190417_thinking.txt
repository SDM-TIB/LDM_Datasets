To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Object Discovery and Tracking in Video Collections" by Suha Kwak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a method that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on a specific dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on the **YouTube-Object dataset**. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its characteristics, size, and any specific splits or annotations that are relevant.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of the YouTube-Object dataset, stating that it consists of videos downloaded from YouTube, segmented by automatic shot boundary detection, and includes ground-truth boxes for a subset of the videos. This confirms that the dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the YouTube-Object dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Prest, A., Leistner, C., Civera, J., Schmid, C., & Ferrari, V. (2012). Learning object class detectors from weakly annotated video. In CVPR, pages 3282â€“3289.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **YouTube-Object Dataset**: This dataset consists of videos downloaded from YouTube, featuring 10 object classes from the PASCAL VOC dataset. It is challenging due to large camera motions, view-point changes, and editing effects. Ground-truth boxes are provided for a subset of the videos.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset identified.
