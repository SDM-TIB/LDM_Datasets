To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compartmental Models for COVID-19 and Control via Policy Interventions" by Swapneel Mehta and Noah Kasmanoff, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for modeling or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data that inform their modeling of COVID-19. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to existing datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the models used and any datasets that were employed in the simulations or analyses. The authors may specify the datasets used for parameter estimation or model validation.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors present any findings based on specific datasets. This section may include tables or figures that summarize data used in the analysis, which can provide insights into the datasets referenced.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations of any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may reference datasets related to COVID-19 case numbers, testing data, or demographic information relevant to their modeling efforts. I will look for specific names of datasets, such as government databases or publicly available datasets used for epidemiological modeling.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to academic standards.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that all dataset citations are complete and accurate, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or reporting.
