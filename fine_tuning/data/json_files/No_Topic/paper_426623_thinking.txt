To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Data Association for Multi-Object Tracking using Only Coordinates" by Mehdi Miah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets: **DanceTrack**, **MOT17**, and **KITTIMOT**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **DanceTrack**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 40 training videos, 25 validation videos, and 35 test videos, focusing on challenging scenarios with similar appearances and severe occlusions.

2. **MOT17**: This dataset is noted for having 7 training videos and 7 test videos, featuring simple and linear movements of humans, with varying camera setups.

3. **KITTIMOT**: This dataset includes videos of cars and pedestrians, recorded with a camera mounted on a car, and is noted for its challenging conditions due to lower frame rates.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **DanceTrack**, the citation is:
  > Sun, P., Cao, J., Jiang, Y., Yuan, Z., Bai, S., Kitani, K., Luo, P. (2021). DanceTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Uniform Appearance and Diverse Motion. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- For **MOT17**, the citation is:
  > Milan, A., Leal-Taixe, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., Schindler, K. (2016). MOT16: A Benchmark for Multi-Object Tracking. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **KITTIMOT**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Urtasun, R. (2012). Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
