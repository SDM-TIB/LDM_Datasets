To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning for Covariance Estimation" by Tzvi Diskin and Ami Wiesel, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning for covariance estimation but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using **synthetic data** and the **IPIX clutter dataset** for their experiments. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset created for their experiments, which is generated based on specific statistical properties. However, since this is a synthetic dataset, it may not have a formal citation like real-world datasets.

2. **IPIX Clutter Dataset**: The authors refer to the IPIX radar sea clutter database, which is a well-known dataset in the radar signal processing community. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the IPIX dataset. The reference provided in the paper is:

- For **IPIX Radar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > IPIX Radar. The McMaster IPIX radar sea clutter database, 2001.

Since the synthetic data does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a generated dataset based on specific parameters described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: A dataset generated for the purpose of the experiments, based on specific statistical properties.
2. **IPIX Clutter Dataset**: A real-world dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that the citation for the IPIX dataset is included, while noting that the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
