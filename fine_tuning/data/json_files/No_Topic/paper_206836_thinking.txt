To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Network Aided Scenario Identification in Wireless Multi-path Fading Channels" by Jun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have tested their method under various channel scenarios, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical results section** where the authors mention that they have obtained a vector set of 4800 D-DPDPs corresponding to 6 channel scenarios. This is a strong indication that specific datasets are being used for evaluation.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a summary of the channel models used for their experiments. The table lists six channel scenarios, which are:

1. **COST207 Rural Area (RA) 4 taps**
2. **COST207 Rural Area (RA) 6 taps**
3. **COST207 Typical Urban (TU) 6 taps**
4. **COST207 Bad Urban (BU) 6 taps**
5. **COST207 Hilly Terrain (HT) 6 taps**
6. **COST207 Bad Urban (BU) 12 taps**

These scenarios are essential for understanding the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or models mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit dataset citations for the COST207 models, but I can infer that these models are based on established channel modeling techniques in wireless communications.

The relevant references that may provide context for the COST207 channel models are:

- **Reference [4]**: F. Hlawatsch, and G. Matz, *Wireless Communications Over Rapidly Time-Varying Channels*, Academic Press, 2011.
- **Reference [5]**: T. Zemen, and C. F. Mecklenbrauker, “Time-Variant Channel Estimation Using Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences,” IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 53, no. 9, pp. 3597-3607, 2005.

Although the authors do not provide a specific dataset citation for the COST207 models, these references are foundational texts that describe the channel models used in their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the channel models used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
