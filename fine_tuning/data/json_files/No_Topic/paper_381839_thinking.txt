To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning and Reasoning Multifaceted and Longitudinal Data for Poverty Estimates and Livelihood Capabilities of Lagged Regions in Rural India" by Atharva Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study integrates multiple data sources, including household surveys and satellite images, to analyze poverty in rural India. This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In this paper, the authors discuss various data sources, including:

1. **National Family and Health Survey (NFHS)**: This dataset is crucial for understanding household-level poverty metrics in India.
2. **National Sample Survey (NSS)**: Another important dataset that provides insights into economic conditions and poverty levels.
3. **Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS)**: This dataset offers additional socio-economic data relevant to poverty estimation.
4. **Census Data**: The paper mentions using census data for village-level statistics, which is essential for understanding demographic distributions.
5. **Satellite Imagery**: The authors propose using Landsat data and nighttime light data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) as proxy indicators for economic activity and poverty.

In the **methodology section**, the authors elaborate on how they will utilize these datasets, particularly focusing on the integration of traditional survey data with proxy data sources like satellite imagery and mobile phone usage data.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to retrieve include:

- For **National Family and Health Survey (NFHS)**:
  > International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and ICF. *National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16: India*. Mumbai: IIPS, 2017.

- For **National Sample Survey (NSS)**:
  > Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India. *Key Indicators of Household Consumer Expenditure in India, 2011-12*. New Delhi: Government of India, 2013.

  > Desai, S., Vanneman, R., and National Council of Applied Economic Research. *India Human Development Survey (IHDS), 2005-06*. New Delhi: NCAER, 2006.

- For **Census Data**:
  > Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India. *Census of India 2011*. New Delhi: Government of India, 2011.

  > U.S. Geological Survey. *Landsat 7 Data Users Handbook*. U.S. Department of the Interior, 2009.

- For **Nighttime Light Data**:
  > Elvidge, C. D., Baugh, K. E., Kihn, E. A., et al. "The Nighttime Lights of the World: A Global Perspective." *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their authoritative citations accurately.
