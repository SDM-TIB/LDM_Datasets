To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi Objective Resource Optimization of Wireless Network Based on Cross Domain Virtual Network Embedding" by Chao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, the authors discuss the parameters and settings for their experiments, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. This could include datasets used in previous studies that the authors reference.

Upon reviewing the references, I will identify any datasets that are commonly used in the context of virtual network embedding or resource optimization in wireless networks. I will ensure to note the full citations for these datasets as they are crucial for proper attribution.

If I find any datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset. If no specific datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details for clarity and proper citation.
