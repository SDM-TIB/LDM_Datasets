To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Counterfactual Control for Free from Generative Models" by Nicholas Guttenberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of generative models and their application in reinforcement learning, but they do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section**, as this is often where datasets are detailed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **Cartpole balancing task** from AI Gym environments, specifically 'Cartpole-v0' and 'Cartpole-v1'. This indicates that these environments are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Cartpole environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, which is a widely recognized toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:

- For **OpenAI Gym**:
  > Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **Cartpole-v0** (part of OpenAI Gym)
2. **Cartpole-v1** (part of OpenAI Gym)

Both datasets are referenced under the same citation for OpenAI Gym. I will ensure that this citation is included in any final output or documentation regarding the datasets extracted from this paper.
