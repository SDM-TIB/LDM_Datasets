To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Self-Gated Whole-Heart 4D Flow Imaging from a Five-Minute Scan" by Aaron Pruitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation and comparison. In this section, the authors describe the acquisition of data from **eight healthy volunteers** and **two patients**, which indicates that there are datasets associated with these subjects.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references to established datasets in the **results section**. The authors may compare their findings against standard datasets or previously published datasets, which would be crucial for citation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors utilized data from **healthy subjects** and **patients** but do not mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe their own data acquisition methods and the specific parameters used during imaging.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the datasets are proprietary to the study and not publicly available. However, I will still document the details of the subjects involved in the study, as this information is relevant for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the paper is:
> Pruitt A, Rich A, Liu Y, Jin N, Potter L, Tong M, Rajpal S, Simonetti O, Ahmad R. *Fully Self-Gated Whole-Heart 4D Flow Imaging from a Five-Minute Scan*. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. To Appear.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:
1. **Dataset from Healthy Volunteers**: Data acquired from eight healthy subjects (age range 20-46).
2. **Dataset from Patients**: Data acquired from two patients with specific medical histories.

Finally, I will ensure that all information is clearly presented and ready for any further processing or review.
