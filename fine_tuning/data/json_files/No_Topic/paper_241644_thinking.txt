To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probing Linguistic Features of Sentence-Level Representations in Neural Relation Extraction" by Christoph Alt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two datasets, **TACRED** and **SemEval 2010 Task 8**, for their experiments. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **TACRED Dataset**: The paper describes TACRED as containing 106,264 sentences with entity mention pairs collected from the TAC KBP evaluations. It includes various relation types, such as person and organization-oriented relations.

2. **SemEval 2010 Task 8**: This dataset is noted as a standard benchmark for binary relation classification, containing 10,717 sentences for training and 2,717 for testing, with various directed semantic relation types.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TACRED Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuhao Zhang, Victor Zhong, Danqi Chen, Gabor Angeli, and Christopher D. Manning. *Graph convolution over pruned dependency trees improves relation extraction*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2205–2215, 2018.

- For the **SemEval 2010 Task 8**, the citation is:
  > Iris Hendrickx, Su Nam Kim, Zornitsa Kozareva, Preslav Nakov, Diarmuid Ó Séaghdha, Sebastian Pado, Marco Pennacchiotti, Lorenza Romano, and Stan Szpakowicz. *SemEval-2010 task 8: Multi-way classification of semantic relations between pairs of nominals*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 33–38, 2010.

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets referenced in the paper.
