To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Holistic Measures for Evaluating Prediction Models in Smart Grids" by Saima Aman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions using "real energy use data for three Smart Grid applications," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 7 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Electricity Consumption Data**: This dataset consists of 15-minute granularity electricity consumption data collected by the USC Facility Management Services from 2008 to 2010. The authors note that this dataset provides approximately 100,000 samples per building and includes both training and testing data.

2. **Weather Data**: This dataset includes historical hourly average and maximum temperature data curated by NOAA for the Los Angeles/USC Campus for the same period (2008–2010). The authors mention that these values were linearly interpolated to obtain 15-minute values.

3. **Schedule Data**: This dataset contains information related to the semester periods, working days, and holidays from USC’s Academic Calendar.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely internal datasets or publicly available data sources. Therefore, I will note that the Electricity Consumption Data is available upon request for academic use, and the Weather Data is sourced from NOAA.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details:

1. **Electricity Consumption Data**:
   - Description: 15-minute granularity electricity consumption data collected by USC Facility Management Services from 2008 to 2010.
   - Citation: Available upon request for academic use.

2. **Weather Data**:
   - Description: Historical hourly average and maximum temperature data curated by NOAA for Los Angeles/USC Campus for 2008–2010.
   - Citation: NOAA Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data, cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/qclcd/.

3. **Schedule Data**:
   - Description: Information related to semester periods, working days, and holidays from USC’s Academic Calendar.
   - Citation: USC Academic Calendar, academics.usc.edu/calendar/.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are accurate and complete. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
