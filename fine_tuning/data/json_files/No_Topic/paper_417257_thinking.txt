To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InRanker: Distilled Rankers for Zero-shot Information Retrieval" by Thiago Laitz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a method for distilling large rankers and mentions the generation of synthetic training data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** section, particularly where the authors describe their approach to knowledge distillation. Here, they mention using the **MS MARCO** dataset for real-world data, which is a key dataset in their experiments. I will note down its details.

Then, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** section. The authors refer to the **BEIR benchmark**, which consists of multiple datasets. They specifically mention using 16 datasets from BEIR for their experiments, and I will need to identify these datasets.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is used for training with real-world query-document pairs. The citation for MS MARCO is:
   > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. arXiv:1611.09268 [cs.CL], 2016.

2. **BEIR Benchmark**: This benchmark includes multiple datasets for evaluating information retrieval models. The citation for the BEIR benchmark is:
   > Nandan Thakur, Nils Reimers, Andreas Rücklé, Abhishek Srivastava, and Iryna Gurevych. *BEIR: A Heterogeneous Benchmark for Zero-shot Evaluation of Information Retrieval Models*. In Thirty-fifth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Datasets and Benchmarks Track (Round 2), 2021. https://openreview.net/forum?id=wCu6T5xFjeJ

3. The paper mentions several specific datasets from the BEIR benchmark, including **TREC-COVID**, **NFCorpus**, **BioASQ**, **NQ**, **HotpotQA**, **Climate-FEVER**, **DBPedia**, **TREC-NEWS**, **Robust04**, **ArguAna**, **Touché-2020**, **Quora**, **SCIDOCS**, **SciFact**, **FiQA-2018**, and **Signal-1M**. I will need to ensure that I provide citations for these datasets as well, if available.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their sources for future reference.
