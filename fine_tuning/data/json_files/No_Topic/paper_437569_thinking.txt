To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Medicine: A Survey" by Yanxin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific dataset references.

Next, I will pay particular attention to **Section 3 (Products of LLM for Medicine)**, as this section is likely to detail various models and their associated datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the development or evaluation of the models discussed.

In this section, I notice that several models are mentioned, such as **BioBERT** and **Med-PaLM**. I will extract information about the datasets associated with these models. For example, the paper mentions that **BioBERT** is pre-trained on a vast biomedical corpus, which is a significant dataset in the context of medical language models.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For instance, if the paper refers to a specific dataset like the **MedQA dataset** used for evaluating Med-PaLM, I will locate the corresponding citation in the references.

Here are the datasets I will extract based on the information gathered:

1. **BioBERT Dataset**: This dataset is a large biomedical corpus used for pre-training the BioBERT model. The citation for BioBERT is:
   > Lee, J., Yoon, W., Kim, S., Kim, D., Kim, C. H., & So, J. (2020). BioBERT: A pre-trained biomedical language representation model for biomedical text mining. *Bioinformatics*, 36(4), 1234-1240.

2. **MedQA Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the clinical capabilities of the Med-PaLM model. The citation for the MedQA dataset is:
   > Singhal, K., Azizi, S., Tu, T., Mahdavi, S. S., Wei, J., Chung, H. W., Scales, N., Tanwani, A., Cole-Lewis, H., & Pfohl, S. (2022). Large language models encode clinical knowledge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.13138*.

3. **PanGu Drug Model Dataset**: This dataset includes a collection of molecular data used for drug discovery tasks. The citation for the PanGu drug model is:
   > Lin, X., Xu, C., Xiong, Z., Zhang, X., Ni, B., Ni, J., Chang, R., Pan, Z., Wang, F., & Yu, F. (2023). PanGu drug model: Learn a molecule like a human. *Science China Life Sciences*, 66(5), 879-882.

4. **HelixFold-Single Dataset**: This dataset is used for protein structure prediction. The citation for HelixFold-Single is:
   > Fang, X., Wang, F., Liu, L., He, J., Lin, D., Xiang, Y., Zhu, K., Zhang, X., Wu, H., & Li, H. (2023). A method for multiple-sequence-alignment-free protein structure prediction using a protein language model. *Nature Machine Intelligence*, 5(11), 1087-1096.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their relevant citations from the paper.
