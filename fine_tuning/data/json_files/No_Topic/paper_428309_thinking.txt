To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoRE: Document-Level Relation Extraction with Large Language Models" by Lilong Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments showcase AutoRE's performance on the **RE-DocRED dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors state that they used the **Re-DocRED dataset** for fine-tuning their model. They also mention refining this dataset by removing duplicates and ensuring factual accuracy, which suggests that they have made modifications to the original dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results based on the **Re-DocRED dataset**, confirming its use in their evaluations. They mention that the dataset consists of 499 articles and 17,448 triplet facts, which gives me more context about the dataset's structure and size.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Re-DocRED dataset**. The paper cites the original work related to the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the Re-DocRED dataset is:

- For **Re-DocRED**, the citation is:
  > Qingyu Tan, Lu Xu, Lidong Bing, Hwee Tou Ng, and Sharifah Mahani Aljunied. *Revisiting DocRED - Addressing the False Negative Problem in Relation Extraction*. In Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **Re-DocRED dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for any further processing or review.
