To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anaphora Resolution in Dialogue Systems for South Asian Languages" by Vinay Annam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors trained and tested their system on a **Telugu conversation corpus** they generated, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **corpus and annotation section (Section 5)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. They describe the corpus as consisting of **157 conversations** that include various pronoun types and mentions, balanced by gender, number, and person. This section confirms the existence of a dataset and provides specific details about its composition.

The authors also mention that the total number of mentions in the corpus is **775**, and they provide information about the annotation process, which adds context to the dataset's creation and its intended use.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves and not published elsewhere, it may not have a formal citation. In this case, I will create a citation based on the information provided in the paper:

- **Telugu Conversation Corpus**: 
  > Vinay Annam, Nikhil Koditala, and Radhika Mamidi. *Anaphora Resolution in Dialogue Systems for South Asian Languages*. BML Munjal University, 2023.

Since this is a self-created dataset, I will ensure to note that it is not publicly available but is described in detail in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, including the name, description, and citation, ready for structured output. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
