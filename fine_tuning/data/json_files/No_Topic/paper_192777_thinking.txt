To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Submodular meets Structured: Finding Diverse Subsets in Exponentially-Large Structured Item Sets" by Adarsh Prasad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks. If the authors mention any datasets explicitly, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for subsections that might be titled "Datasets" or similar, where the authors are likely to describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field, as this might provide context for their own dataset choices.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and organized manner, making sure to include all relevant citations for each dataset extracted from the paper.
