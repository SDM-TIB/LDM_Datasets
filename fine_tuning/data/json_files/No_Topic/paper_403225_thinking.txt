To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BridgeHand2Vec" by Anna Sztyber-Betley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the BridgeHand2Vec approach and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, it does refer to the Double Dummy Bridge Problem (DDBP), which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (BridgeHand2Vec representation)**, where the authors describe the training of a neural network for the DDBP2 problem. Here, they mention that the training data were generated using the Bridge Calculator. This indicates that the dataset used for training the neural network is derived from this tool.

In **section 2.1**, the authors specify that they generated **400,000 hands** for training, which were then flipped to create a total of **800,000 training examples**. This is a significant dataset for their experiments, but I need to find the proper citation for the Bridge Calculator tool mentioned.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Bridge Calculator. The citation is as follows:
> Piotr Beling, ‘Partition search revisited’, IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 9(1), 76–87, (2017).

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 3 (Applications)**, the authors discuss the use of the BridgeHand2Vec representation in various applications, but they do not introduce any new datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that the primary dataset used for the experiments is the one generated from the Bridge Calculator, which consists of 800,000 training examples of bridge hands.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation for the dataset. The final dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Bridge Hands Dataset**: A dataset of 800,000 bridge hands generated using the Bridge Calculator for training a neural network to solve the DDBP2 problem.
   - Citation: Piotr Beling, ‘Partition search revisited’, IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games, 9(1), 76–87, (2017).

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
