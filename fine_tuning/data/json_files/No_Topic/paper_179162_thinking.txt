To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Music Classification" by Keunwoo Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for music tagging, specifically the **Million Song Dataset**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they explicitly state that they use the **Million Song Dataset** with last.fm tags for training their models. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of clips used for training and validation, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Million Song Dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Bertin-Mahieux, Thierry, Daniel PW Ellis, Brian Whitman, and Paul Lamere. "The million song dataset." In Proceedings of the 12th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, Miami, Florida, USA, October 24-28, 2011.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to document it thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for easy reference and clarity in understanding the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Million Song Dataset** and ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
