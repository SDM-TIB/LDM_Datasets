To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CBMV: A Coalesced Bidirectional Matching Volume for Disparity Estimation" by Konstantinos Batsos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors submitted results to the **KITTI** and **ETH3D** benchmarks and trained their classifier on the **Middlebury 2014 dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Middlebury 2014 Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as containing a training set of 15 stereo pairs, 13 additional stereo pairs with publicly available ground truth, and a test set of 15 stereo pairs for which the ground truth has not been released. The dataset is noted for its challenging conditions, including imperfect rectification and varying exposure.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors refer to both the 2012 and 2015 versions of the KITTI stereo benchmark, which consist of approximately 200 training and 200 testing stereo pairs. The ground truth is semi-dense, covering about 30% of all pixels, and is concentrated in the lower part of the images.

3. **ETH3D Dataset**: This dataset includes 27 training and 20 testing stereo pairs, with dense ground truth generated by a laser scanner. The ground truth for the training set is publicly available, while the test set's ground truth has not been released.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Middlebury 2014 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Scharstein, D., Hirschmüller, H., Kitajima, Y., Krathwohl, G., Nešić, N., Wang, X., & Westling, P. (2014). High-resolution stereo datasets with subpixel-accurate ground truth. In *German Conference on Pattern Recognition*.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset. *International Journal of Robotics Research*, 32(11), 1229-1235.

- For the **ETH3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Schöps, T., Schönberger, J. L., Galliani, S., Sattler, T., Schindler, K., Pollefeys, M., & Geiger, A. (2017). A multi-view stereo benchmark with high-resolution images and multi-camera videos. In *Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
