To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rooting of thornless blackberry cuttings as induced by the extract of white willow (Salix alba L.) shoots collected in different times" by Kocher Omer Salih et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, including the collection of willow shoots and their effects on rooting percentages, which suggests that there may be relevant data to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, where the authors describe the collection of willow shoots and the experimental setup. They mention that shoots were collected on the 15th of each month in 2022, which indicates a time series dataset related to the effects of different collection dates on rooting.

In the **results section**, the authors present data in tables that summarize the effects of different treatments on various parameters such as rooting percentage, callusing percentage, and root length. I will carefully examine these tables to extract specific datasets. For instance, Table 1 lists the rooting percentages for cuttings treated with extracts from willow shoots collected on different dates, which is crucial data.

I will also look for any additional datasets related to the quantification of phytochemicals (like total phenols, flavonoids, IAA, and salicylic acid) in the willow shoots, as mentioned in the results and figures. This data is likely to be presented in a structured format that can be easily extracted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the study.

For example, if the authors reference specific methods for quantifying IAA or phenolic compounds, I will ensure to include those citations as part of the dataset descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key details of each dataset, such as the parameters measured, the collection dates, and any relevant statistical results.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the research paper while providing the necessary citations for each dataset.
