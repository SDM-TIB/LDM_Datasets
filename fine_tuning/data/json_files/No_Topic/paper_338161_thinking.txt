To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Dialogue Policy for Continual Reinforcement Learning" by Christian Geishauser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a continual learning algorithm for dialogue systems, but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention using the **MultiWOZ dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset for task-oriented dialogue systems, and I will note its details.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) for any additional datasets that might be referenced. The authors discuss various approaches and prior works, but they primarily focus on the methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In the **appendices**, particularly Appendix A.2, the authors provide details about the experimental setup, including the use of the **MultiWOZ dataset**. This confirms its role in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **MultiWOZ dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Paweł Budzianowski, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Bo-Hsiang Tseng, Iñigo Casanueva, Stefan Ultes, Osman Ramadan, and Milica Gašić. *MultiWOZ - a large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset for task-oriented dialogue modelling*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 5016–5026, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the **MultiWOZ dataset** as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and formatted appropriately for downstream processing.
