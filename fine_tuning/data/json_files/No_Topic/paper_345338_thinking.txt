To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Integration of Acoustics and LiDAR: a Multi-Modal Approach to Acoustic Reflector Estimation" by Ellen Riemens et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the integration of LiDAR and microphone measurements for acoustic reflector estimation, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results** section, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned. I will look for any specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations. The paper describes various experiments, but I need to identify if any datasets are explicitly named or referenced.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. This section often contains important information about the datasets used in the research, including full citations.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or name as it appears in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Room Acoustics Dataset," I would look for its description and citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly named, I will note that as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting datasets from the paper.
