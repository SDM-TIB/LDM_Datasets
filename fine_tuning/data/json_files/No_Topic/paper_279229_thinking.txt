To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fourier-domain Variational Formulation and Its Well-posedness for Supervised Learning" by Tao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, there may not be a specific section labeled "Datasets," so I will need to pay close attention to any references to datasets within the text.

As I read through the paper, I will note any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, dimensions, or specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity and reproducibility.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I will look for the original paper that introduced the dataset and note its citation. If the authors refer to a dataset they created or used in their experiments, I will ensure to capture the citation provided in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will review my findings to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
