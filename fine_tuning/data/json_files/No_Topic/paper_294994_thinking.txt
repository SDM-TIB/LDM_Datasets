To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prescribed-Time Control with Linear Decay for Nonlinear Systems" by Amir Shakouri and Nima Assadian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses prior work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections that might detail experiments or simulations**, as these sections typically provide information about datasets used for validation. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any numerical simulations mentioned, as they often rely on specific datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. This is crucial because datasets are often derived from previous works, and the authors may cite those sources.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will note that as well, indicating that no datasets were provided or referenced in the study.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset I identified, formatted correctly for clarity and accuracy.
