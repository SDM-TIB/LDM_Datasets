To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Volatility in Interest Rate Models" by V.M. Belyaev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a new approach to local volatility implementation but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the author references the Local Volatility Model presented by Dupire and discusses its applications. However, there are no datasets mentioned here either.

Moving on to **section 2 (Small Volatility Approximation)**, I will look for any datasets used for calibration or testing. The section discusses the HJM interest rate model and its dynamics but does not specify any datasets.

In **section 3 (Sensitivity Calculation)**, the author mentions a selected data set for SOFR swaption volatility smile, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will note this down and look for more details.

In **section 4 (Fixed Tenor Dynamics)** and **section 5 (Local Volatility Scenarios)**, the author discusses the calibration process and scenario generation but does not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. The references include works by Dupire, Gatheral, and others, but they do not specifically cite datasets.

The only mention of a dataset is in section 3, where the author refers to a "selected data set for SOFR swaption volatility smile." However, the paper does not provide a full citation for this dataset, nor does it specify where it can be accessed.

Since I cannot find any formal datasets with full citations in the paper, I will summarize my findings:

1. **SOFR Swaption Volatility Smile Data**: The paper mentions a dataset used for calibration of the SOFR swaption volatility smile, but it lacks a formal citation or detailed reference.

In conclusion, while I identified a reference to a dataset, the lack of detailed information or citations means I cannot provide a complete dataset entry as per the required format. I will document this finding and note the absence of full citations for datasets in this paper.
