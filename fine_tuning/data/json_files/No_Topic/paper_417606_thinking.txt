To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Should ChatGPT Write Your Breakup Text? Exploring the Role of AI in Relationship Dissolution" by Yue Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction outlines the research questions and context. I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (section 3) in detail. This section typically contains information about the participants, data collection methods, and any datasets that were utilized. In this case, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 participants, which suggests that the dataset consists of qualitative data derived from these interviews. However, I need to confirm if there are any publicly available datasets referenced or if the authors created a specific dataset from their findings.

I will also check the **results section** (section 4) to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or data analysis techniques that could be relevant. This section may provide insights into how the data was analyzed and whether any datasets were used to support their findings.

After identifying any datasets, I will look for the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if they are publicly available.

If the paper does not mention any external datasets but rather relies on the qualitative data collected from interviews, I will note that the dataset is original and based on the authors' research.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets referenced in the paper, as this is essential for academic integrity and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methodology section for details on data collection and any datasets used.
3. Check the results section for references to datasets or data analysis.
4. Look at the references section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
5. Compile the findings and ensure proper citation for any datasets identified.
