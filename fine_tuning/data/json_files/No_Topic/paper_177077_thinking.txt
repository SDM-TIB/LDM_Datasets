To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Adaptive Data Analysis Guarantees from Subgaussianity" by Sam Elder, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the concept of adaptive data analysis and mentions algorithms and guarantees but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of adaptive data analysis but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is no explicit section labeled "Datasets," but I will check the **experiments** or **methodology** sections for any references to datasets used in the analysis. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that it primarily discusses theoretical concepts and does not provide empirical results based on specific datasets. Therefore, I will not find any datasets explicitly mentioned in the text.

Since there are no datasets to extract, I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. However, the references listed focus on theoretical work and do not cite specific datasets.

In conclusion, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I determine that there are no datasets to extract or cite. I will document this finding clearly, noting that the paper is theoretical in nature and does not include empirical datasets.

Thus, my final output will reflect that no datasets were found in this research paper, along with a note on the theoretical focus of the work.
