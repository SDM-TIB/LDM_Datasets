To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Approximate Backpropagation Learning Rule for Memristor Based Neural Networks Using Synaptic Plasticity" by D. Negrova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of implementing neural networks in hardware, particularly using memristors, but they do not mention any specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their modeling experiments. Here, they state that they used the **MNIST dataset** for training their neural network. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset consisting of 70,000 handwritten digits, which is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

The authors specify that out of the 70,000 images, 60,000 are used for training and 10,000 for testing. This is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- For **MNIST dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998. doi:10.1109/5.726791.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial insights.
2. Focus on the experiments section to find explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Identify the MNIST dataset as the primary dataset used in the research.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
