To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Energy-Based Models for End-to-End Speech Recognition" by Qiujia Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **LibriSpeech dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **"train-clean-100" subset of the LibriSpeech corpus** for training the baseline ASR model and R-EBMs. They also specify the dev and test sets as **dev-clean/dev-other** and **test-clean/test-other**, respectively. This confirms that the LibriSpeech dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech**:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
