To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence Scores Make Instance-dependent Label-noise Learning Possible" by Antonin Berthon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through multiple experiments on datasets with synthetic label noise and real-world unknown noise. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a **synthetic dataset** consisting of three classes of concentric circles, which is generated to demonstrate the instance-dependent noise (IDN) model. They also refer to real-world datasets such as **SVHN** (Street View House Numbers) and **CIFAR10**, which are commonly used benchmarks in machine learning.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments** or **related works** sections. The authors specifically mention using the **Clothing1M** dataset, which includes one million images of shopping items labeled automatically using surrounding meta-data. This dataset is significant as it is known for its instance-dependent label noise.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors generated this dataset themselves, so it does not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

2. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation for the SVHN dataset is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

4. **Clothing1M Dataset**: The citation for the Clothing1M dataset is:
   > Tong Xiao, Tian Xia, Yi Yang, Chang Huang, and Xiaogang Wang. *Learning from Massive Noisy Labeled Data for Image Classification*. In CVPR, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:
- Synthetic Dataset (self-generated, no citation)
- SVHN Dataset (Netzer et al., 2011)
- CIFAR10 Dataset (Krizhevsky, 2009)
- Clothing1M Dataset (Xiao et al., 2015)

This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations effectively.
