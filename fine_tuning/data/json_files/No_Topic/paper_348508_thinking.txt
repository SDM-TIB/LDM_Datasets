To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cascade Model for Argument Mining in Japanese Political Discussions: the QA Lab-PoliInfo-3 Case Study" by Ramon Ruiz-Dolz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Budget Argument Mining (BAM) task, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Budget Argument Mining)**, where the author describes the BAM task and the corpus used for experiments. Here, the paper mentions that the data is structured into three different documents:

1. **PoliInfo3_BAM-budget.json**: This document contains budget data with 768 different budget items, each having eleven descriptive features.

2. **PoliInfo3_BAM-minutes-training.json**: This training document includes 29 proceedings from local circumscriptions and 2 speech records from the national diet, totaling 1573 utterances and 1248 monetary expressions.

3. **PoliInfo3_BAM-minutes-test.json**: Similar to the training document, this test document contains 760 utterances from local circumscriptions and 123 speeches from the national diet, with 520 unlabelled monetary expressions.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are specific to the task and do not have external citations. Instead, I will note the names and details as they are presented in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **PoliInfo3_BAM-budget.json**: Contains budget items with various features.
2. **PoliInfo3_BAM-minutes-training.json**: Contains training data with utterances and monetary expressions.
3. **PoliInfo3_BAM-minutes-test.json**: Contains test data with utterances and unlabelled monetary expressions.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their structure and purpose, to prepare for any further processing or documentation.
