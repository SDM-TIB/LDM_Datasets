To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Animation Skeletons for 3D Articulated Models via Volumetric Nets" by Zhan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors trained their model on a "large dataset of 3D rigged characters mined from the web," which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific details in the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges of predicting jointed skeletons and highlight the need for a dataset. In the methodology section, they provide more context about the dataset they collected.

In **section 5 (Training)**, the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they collected a dataset of **3,277 rigged characters from an online repository called Models Resource**. They also provide statistics about the dataset, such as the average number of joints per character and how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is referenced as follows:

- **Models Resource**: 
  > V. Resource. The models resource, https://www.models-resource.com/, 2019.

This citation indicates that the dataset is publicly available online, which is important for reproducibility and further research.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a description, and the full citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise dataset entry ready for review or further processing.
