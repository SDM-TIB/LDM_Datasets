To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expectation Distance-based Distributional Clustering for Noise-Robustness" by Rahmat Adesunkanmi and Ratnesh Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors implemented their clustering algorithms on **real-world weather data** and **stock data**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments and results sections**. In the results section, the authors describe their experiments with two types of data:

1. **Weather Data**: The authors mention that they used weather data collected from five weather stations in Colorado, specifically from the Colorado State University CoAgMET Raw Data Access. They detail that the data spans multiple years and includes various meteorological measurements.

2. **Stock Data**: The authors also describe using stock market price data from 77 of the top 100 Nasdaq stocks, covering daily adjusted closing prices over a two-year period (2018-2019).

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **weather data**, the citation is:
> Colorado State University CoAgMET Raw Data Access. *CoAgMET Weather Data*. [Online]. Available: https://www.coagmet.colostate.edu/

For the **stock data**, the citation is:
> Stock market data sourced from the Nasdaq. *Nasdaq Stock Market*. [Online]. Available: https://www.nasdaq.com/

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
