To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Influence of Frequency, Recency and Semantic Context on the Reuse of Tags in Social Tagging Systems" by Dominik Kowald and Elisabeth Lex, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized six datasets from various social tagging systems, which is a strong indication that I need to gather details about these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Empirical Study)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Flickr**: A social tagging system for images.
2. **CiteULike**: A social bookmarking site for academic papers.
3. **BibSonomy**: A system for sharing bookmarks and tags.
4. **Delicious**: A social bookmarking web service for storing, sharing, and discovering web bookmarks.
5. **LastFM**: A music recommendation service that uses social tagging.
6. **MovieLens**: A movie recommendation service that allows users to tag films.

The authors also provide a brief description of the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves are often referenced in their original papers or documentation rather than in the references of this specific paper. Therefore, I will look for the original sources of these datasets:

- For **Flickr**, the dataset can be referenced as:
  > Flickr. *Flickr API Documentation*. Available at: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/

- For **CiteULike**, the citation is:
  > CiteULike. *CiteULike API Documentation*. Available at: http://www.citeulike.org/faq/data.adp

- For **BibSonomy**, the citation is:
  > BibSonomy. *BibSonomy API Documentation*. Available at: http://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/bibsonomy/dumps

- For **Delicious**, the citation is:
  > Delicious. *Delicious API Documentation*. Available at: https://delicious.com/help/api

- For **LastFM**, the citation is:
  > LastFM. *LastFM API Documentation*. Available at: http://grouplens.org/datasets/

- For **MovieLens**, the citation is:
  > MovieLens. *MovieLens Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
