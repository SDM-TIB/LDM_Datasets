To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Based Calibration Transfer" by Ramin Nikzad-Langerodi and Florian Sobieczky, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions testing the proposed method on the **corn benchmark dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental section)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **Cargill corn benchmark dataset** obtained from Eigenvector Research Inc. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of samples, the type of measurements (NIR spectra), and the instruments used.

The authors state that the dataset comprises NIR spectra from **80 samples of corn** measured on **3 different spectrometers** at **700 spectral channels** in the wavelength range of **1100-2498 nm** at **2 nm intervals**. They also mention that the spectra of the first **3 NBS glass standards** included in the dataset were used as calibration standards in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cargill corn benchmark dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it does reference Eigenvector Research Inc. as the source. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is associated with Eigenvector Research Inc. and provide the URL mentioned in the paper for further reference.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Eigenvector Research Inc. *Cargill Corn Benchmark Dataset*. Available at: http://www.eigenvector.com/data/Corn/ (accessed April 11, 2018).

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the research, gathered relevant details, and located the citation. This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary information regarding the dataset from the paper.
