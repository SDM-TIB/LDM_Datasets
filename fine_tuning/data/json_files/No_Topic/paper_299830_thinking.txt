To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a method to anticipate dark matter signals with deep learning at the LHC" by Ernesto Arganda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned directly. The abstract discusses the use of neural networks and mentions organizing data in 2D histograms, which suggests that datasets are involved, but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to specific datasets. The introduction discusses dark matter models and mentions the use of machine learning techniques, but again does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then move on to **section 2 (Models and sample generation)**, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors describe the generation of samples for different dark matter models. They mention using **MadGraph5 aMC@NLO** to generate events and specify that they produced **0.5M events** for each theoretical framework. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name.

In **section 2.2 (Sample generation)**, the authors detail the processes used to generate events for the dark matter models, including the **monojet plus missing energy** channel. They mention generating events for various theoretical frameworks but do not provide specific dataset names.

In **section 2.3 (Kinematic distributions)**, the authors discuss the kinematic features used as input data for the machine learning algorithms. They mention generating several sets of events for different models, but again, no specific dataset names are provided.

Next, I will check the **appendices** for any additional information on datasets. The appendices contain various details about the models and processes but do not mention specific datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of papers discussing theoretical models and methodologies but do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that while the authors describe the generation of datasets and the processes involved, they do not explicitly name any datasets or provide citations for them. Therefore, I will note that there are no specific datasets extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings as follows:

- No specific datasets were named or cited in the paper.
- The authors discussed the generation of samples for various dark matter models but did not provide formal dataset citations.

This thorough review indicates that while the paper discusses methodologies and sample generation, it lacks explicit dataset references that can be extracted and cited.
