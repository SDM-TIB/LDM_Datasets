To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Question Answering as an Automatic Evaluation Metric for News Article Summarization" by Matan Eyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss various news datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the CNN/Daily Mail dataset as a prominent dataset used for summarization tasks. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the part discussing the APES metric, the authors describe how they utilize the CNN/Daily Mail dataset for their experiments. They mention that this dataset contains 312,085 articles with relevant questions, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the TAC 2011 AESOP task, which also includes a dataset used for evaluating summarization systems. This dataset is important to note as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1693â€“1701, 2015.

2. For the **TAC 2011 AESOP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karolina Owczarzak and Hoa Trang Dang. *Overview of the TAC 2011 summarization track: Guided task and AESOP task*. In Proceedings of the Text Analysis Conference (TAC 2011), Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA, November.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets along with their full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
