To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Informed Distance Candidate Selection for Adaptive Lightweight Omnidirectional Stereo Vision with Fisheye Images" by Conner Pulling et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a new dataset for their model, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of omnidirectional distance estimation and mention that they have created a dedicated new dataset. This suggests that the dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for a specific section that discusses the dataset in detail, which is likely to be in the **methods or experimental procedure sections**. Here, the authors describe their dataset as consisting of approximately **95,000 samples** collected from over **60 Unreal Engine 4 simulation environments**. They mention that each sample consists of three RGB-dense distance pairs in fisheye format, and the dataset includes a variety of environments.

The authors also provide a link to their project page where the dataset can be downloaded, which is useful for verification and citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Pulling, C., Tan, J. H., Hu, Y., & Scherer, S. (2023). Geometry-Informed Distance Candidate Selection for Adaptive Lightweight Omnidirectional Stereo Vision with Fisheye Images. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its characteristics and the citation, into a structured format for further processing.
