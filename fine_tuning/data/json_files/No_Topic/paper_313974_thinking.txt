To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Correlation Aggregation: on the Path to Better Graph Neural Networks," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically provides detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in this paper are:

1. **SBM PATTERN**: This dataset is used for graph pattern recognition and consists of 10,000 items in the training set, with an average of 117.47 nodes per graph and 2 classes.

2. **SBM CLUSTER**: This dataset is utilized for semi-supervised graph clustering tasks, containing 10,000 graphs for training, with an average of 117.20 nodes and 6 classes.

3. **ZINC**: This dataset is used for regression tasks related to molecular constrained solubility, with 10,000 training graphs and an average of 23.16 nodes per graph.

4. **TSP**: The TSP dataset is employed for edge classification tasks, with 10,000 training graphs and an average of 275.76 nodes.

5. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is used for few-shot learning tasks, containing 100 classes with 600 images per class.

6. **IMDB-MULTI**: This dataset is a graph classification benchmark where each actor/actress's ego-network forms a graph representing one of three genres, with 1,500 graphs in total.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
