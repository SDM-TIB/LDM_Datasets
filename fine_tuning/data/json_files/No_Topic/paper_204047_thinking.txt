To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Principled Deep Neural Network Training through Linear Programming" by Daniel Bienstock, Gonzalo Mu√±oz, and Sebastian Pokutta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the complexity of training deep neural networks but does not mention specific datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **results or experiments sections**. If there are tables or figures, I will examine them closely, as they often summarize the datasets used in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments. Instead, they focus on theoretical contributions and do not provide empirical results based on specific datasets. This means I will not be able to extract any dataset names or citations from this paper.

Since there are no datasets mentioned, I will conclude my extraction process here. If there were datasets, I would have looked for their full citations in the **references section** to ensure proper documentation.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in this paper, and therefore, no citations can be provided. If datasets had been mentioned, I would have followed the steps of identifying them, checking for descriptions, and retrieving full citations accordingly.
