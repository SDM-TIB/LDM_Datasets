To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nanometer Scanning with Micrometer Sensing: Beating Quantization Constraints in Lissajous Trajectory Tracking" by Matheus Lohse et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and results, which may include mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to look for specific datasets that were utilized in the study. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were applied in the experiments.

I will also check the **figures and tables** throughout the paper, as they often summarize experimental results and may reference datasets directly or indirectly.

After identifying potential datasets, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and their relevance to the study. If the datasets are not named directly, I will note any descriptions that could help in identifying them later.

Once I have gathered information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Lissajous trajectory dataset" or any specific datasets used for tracking experiments, I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets in detail.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity and traceability of the information.
