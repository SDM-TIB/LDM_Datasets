To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Energy Consumption for Variable Customer Portfolios Including Aleatoric Uncertainty Estimation" by Oliver Mey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves using hourly energy consumption data recorded by smart meters, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Methods)**, specifically the subsection titled **B. The Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. They mention that the dataset consists of energy consumption values from **499 anonymized customers located in Spain for the year 2019**, which is crucial information.

The authors also specify that the dataset includes temperature values corresponding to the customers' locations, which adds context to the dataset's features. They clarify that they focused on **314 household customers** within this dataset, which is important for understanding the scope of the data.

In addition, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors provide a specific citation for the dataset they used:

- For the dataset titled **"Energy Consumption Curves of 499 Customers from Spain,"** the citation is:
  > O. Mey, A. Schneider, O. Enge-Rosenblatt, Y. Bravo, P. Stenzel. *Energy Consumption Curves of 499 Customers from Spain*. Fordatis, 2021. doi: 10.24406/fordatis/142.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Energy Consumption Curves of 499 Customers from Spain
   - **Description**: This dataset contains hourly energy consumption values recorded from 499 anonymized customers in Spain for the year 2019, along with corresponding temperature values.
   - **Citation**: O. Mey, A. Schneider, O. Enge-Rosenblatt, Y. Bravo, P. Stenzel. *Energy Consumption Curves of 499 Customers from Spain*. Fordatis, 2021. doi: 10.24406/fordatis/142.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the dataset and its citation.
