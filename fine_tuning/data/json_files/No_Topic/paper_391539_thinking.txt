To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Old but Not Obsolete: Dimensional Analysis in Nondestructive Testing and Evaluation" by Antonello Tamburrino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically describes the experimental setup and any datasets utilized for validation or testing. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize data or results derived from specific datasets. This section may also provide insights into how the datasets were analyzed or compared.

I will also review the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

As I go through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including:

1. **Eddy Current Testing (ECT) Data**: The paper discusses the use of ECT for measuring thickness and electrical conductivity. I will look for specific datasets related to these measurements.

2. **Experimental Data from Plates**: The authors mention conducting experiments on various metallic plates with known thicknesses and electrical conductivities. I will identify the specific datasets used in these experiments.

3. **Numerical Simulations**: If the paper includes any datasets generated from numerical simulations, I will ensure to capture those as well.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile their details, including:

- The name of the dataset.
- A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and the type of data it contains.
- The full citation for each dataset, ensuring that it is formatted correctly for reference.

For example, if I find a dataset related to ECT measurements, I would note it down as follows:

- **Eddy Current Testing Dataset**: This dataset includes measurements of mutual impedance from various metallic plates during ECT experiments. It is used to estimate thickness and electrical conductivity.

Then, I will locate the citation for this dataset in the references section, ensuring it is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will organize all the extracted datasets and their citations in a clear format for easy reference and further use.
