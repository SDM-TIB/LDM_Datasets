To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDI Prediction via Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks" by Farhan Tanvir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a heterogeneous graph model for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which suggests that there are datasets involved in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of predicting DDIs and the need for computational methods. They mention the integration of various data sources, which indicates that multiple datasets may be utilized.

In the **experimental results section**, specifically in **section 4.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they used. They state that they created a multi-type DDI dataset by gathering DDI items from DrugBank, which includes:

1. **DrugBank Dataset**: This dataset consists of 513 approved drugs, their chemical structures, side effects, and drug binding proteins. The authors report a total of 11,845 interactions among these drugs.

2. **BioGRID Dataset**: The authors mention extracting 413 protein-protein interaction (PPI) interactions from BioGRID, which is another dataset used in their analysis.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The DrugBank dataset is commonly cited in the literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation format. The citation for DrugBank is:

- **DrugBank**: 
  > Wishart, D. S., Feunang, Y. D., Marcu, A., et al. (2018). DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 46(D1), D1074-D1082. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1037

For the BioGRID dataset, the citation is:

- **BioGRID**: 
  > Chatr-Aryamontri, A., Oughtred, R., Boucher, L., et al. (2017). The BioGRID interaction database: 2017 update. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 45(D1), D369-D379. https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkw1102

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
