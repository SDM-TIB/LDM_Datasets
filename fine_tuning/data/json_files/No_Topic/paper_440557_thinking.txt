To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QUEST: Quality-Aware Metropolis-Hastings Sampling for Machine Translation" by Gonçalo R. A. Faria et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated across multiple language pairs, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention testing their approach on the **WMT23 test sets** covering four language pairs: ENGLISH ↔ {GERMAN, RUSSIAN}. This indicates that the WMT23 datasets are used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the appropriate citation for the WMT23 datasets.

The citation for the WMT23 datasets is:
> Kocmi, T., Avramidis, E., Bawden, R., et al. (2023). *Findings of the 2023 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT23): LLMs are here but not quite there yet*. In Proceedings of the Eighth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–42, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the WMT23 datasets as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details about the datasets are accurately captured.
