To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Spectral Embedding using the Geodesic Betweenness Centrality" by Shay Deutsch and Stefano Soatto, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any splits used for training/testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Granular Material Networks**: The paper states that the dataset is derived from experimentally determined force networks in granular materials. It mentions that the network data is available in the Dryad repository. This dataset is used for forecasting failure locations in disordered structures.

2. **STRING Network**: The authors mention using the STRING network, which consists of 18,886 nodes and 977,789 edges, including 332 human proteins that physically interact with SARS-CoV-2. This dataset is used for network alignment applications.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the necessary details to properly cite the datasets.

For the **Granular Material Networks**, the citation is:
> Estelle Berthier, Mason A. Porter, and Karen E. Daniels. *Forecasting failure locations in 2-dimensional disordered lattices*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(34):16742â€“16749, Aug 2019.

For the **STRING Network**, the citation is:
> Szklarczyk, D., Franceschini, A., Wyder, S., et al. *STRING v10: protein-protein interaction networks, integrated over the tree of life*. Nucleic Acids Research, 43(D1):D447-D452, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
