To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning based Framework for Automatic Diagnosis of Glaucoma based on analysis of Focal Notching in the Optic Nerve Head" by Sneha Dasgupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on the **DRISHTI-GS dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They mention that the **DRISHTI-GS dataset** consists of 101 fundus images with a resolution of 2896 × 1944 pixels, including both normal and glaucomatous images along with their ground truths. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its composition.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the DRISHTI-GS dataset. The authors reference two papers related to the dataset:

1. **For the DRISHTI-GS dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Sivaswamy, S. Krishnadas, G. D. Joshi, M. Jain, and A. U. S. Tabish. "Drishti-gs: Retinal image dataset for optic nerve head (onh) segmentation." In 2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), pp. 53–56, IEEE, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the relevant sections of the paper to identify datasets.
2. Confirming the dataset details in the materials and methods section.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the dataset information from the research paper.
