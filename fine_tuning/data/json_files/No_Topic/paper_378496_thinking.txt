To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The secret of immersion: actor driven camera movement generation for auto-cinematography" by Xinyi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their method and the datasets they created for training their GAN model and aesthetic adjustor.

Upon reviewing section 4.2 (Dataset), I find that the authors mention two distinct datasets:

1. **Samples for training GAN**: This dataset consists of 25,230 sliced samples, which include 1,135,350 frames. The dataset is created from cinematic resources designed by professional artists, focusing on mimicking film masterpieces. The dataset includes various actions and emotion factors.

2. **Samples for training the aesthetic adjustor (ùúô)**: This dataset comprises 13,066,689 samples, created by combining camera placements and actor poses. The dataset is designed to ensure a diverse set of camera placements that users might choose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are original datasets created by the authors for their specific research, so they may not have external citations.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, along with the authors' names and the publication year for proper citation.

The final entries for the datasets will be:

1. **Dataset Name**: Samples for training GAN
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 25,230 sliced samples, totaling 1,135,350 frames, created from cinematic resources designed by professional artists to mimic film masterpieces.
   - **Citation**: Xinyi Wu, Haohong Wang, and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos. 2023. The secret of immersion: actor driven camera movement generation for auto-cinematography. ACM Trans. Graph. 1, 1 (May 2023), 18 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn

2. **Dataset Name**: Samples for training the aesthetic adjustor (ùúô)
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 13,066,689 samples, created by combining camera placements and actor poses to ensure a diverse set of camera placements.
   - **Citation**: Xinyi Wu, Haohong Wang, and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos. 2023. The secret of immersion: actor driven camera movement generation for auto-cinematography. ACM Trans. Graph. 1, 1 (May 2023), 18 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn

After gathering this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its respective citation.
