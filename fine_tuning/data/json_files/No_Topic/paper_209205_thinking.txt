To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forensic Shoe-Print Identification: A Brief Survey" by Imad Rida et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of shoe-print identification in forensic science, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **evaluation section** (Section 4), as it is likely to contain information about datasets used for performance evaluation. In this section, the authors mention the **Footwear Impression Database (FID-300)**, which is a publicly available dataset for evaluating algorithms in shoe-print identification. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to gather more details about it.

The paper states that the FID-300 dataset contains 1,175 gallery images and 300 probe images, which were digitized after being lifted with a gel foil from the ground. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FID-300 dataset. The paper cites the dataset as follows:
> Kortylewski, A., Albrecht, T., & Vetter, T. (2014). Unsupervised footwear impression analysis and retrieval from crime scene data. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV) (pp. 644-658). Springer. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-16628-5_46.

With this citation, I can now summarize the dataset information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
