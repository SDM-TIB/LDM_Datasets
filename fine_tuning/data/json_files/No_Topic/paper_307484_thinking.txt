To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation without Model Transferring" by Kunhong Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used. In this paper, they mention five datasets: **Digit-Five**, **Office-Caltech**, **Office-31**, **Office-Home**, and **DomainNet**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experimental setup** subsection, the authors describe the **Digit-Five** dataset as containing five domains: MNIST-M, MNIST, SYN, USPS, and SVHN. They also mention the **Office-Caltech** dataset, which consists of four domains: Caltech, Amazon, WebCam, and DSLR. The **Office-31** dataset includes three domains: Amazon, WebCam, and DSLR. The **Office-Home** dataset has four domains: Artistic images, Clip Art, Product images, and Real-World images. Finally, the **DomainNet** dataset is described as containing six domains: Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, and Sketch.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Digit-Five** dataset citation:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
