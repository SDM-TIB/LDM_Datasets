To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverse Compositional Spatial Transformer Networks" by Chen-Hsuan Lin and Simon Lucey, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any details about their characteristics, sizes, and the tasks they are used for.

From my reading, I note that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit classification and the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** for traffic sign classification. I will gather details about these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. It is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)**: This dataset contains 39,209 training images and 12,630 test images across 43 classes of traffic signs. It is used for evaluating the performance of algorithms in recognizing traffic signs under various conditions.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. J. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*, 1998.

- For the **GTSRB**, the citation is:
  > J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A Multi-Class Classification Competition*. In Neural Networks (IJCNN), The 2011 International Joint Conference on, pages 1453â€“1460. IEEE, 2011.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
