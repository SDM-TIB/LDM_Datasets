To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SciMRC: Multi-perspective Scientific Machine Reading Comprehension" by Xiao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel dataset called **SciMRC**, which is a multi-perspective dataset constructed from 741 scientific papers and includes 6,057 question-answer pairs. This indicates that SciMRC is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and emphasize the need for a dataset that considers different reader perspectives (beginners, students, and experts). This reinforces the significance of the **SciMRC** dataset.

In the **section 2 (SciMRC)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset, including its composition and the perspectives it covers. They specify that SciMRC contains:
- 741 scientific papers
- 6,057 question-answer pairs, categorized into three perspectives: 
  - 3,306 pairs from beginners
  - 1,800 pairs from students
  - 951 pairs from experts

This section confirms that **SciMRC** is the only dataset discussed in the paper.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **SciMRC** dataset. However, since the dataset is newly proposed in this paper, it does not have an external citation but can be cited as follows:

- For **SciMRC**, the citation is:
  > Xiao Zhang, Heqi Zheng, Yuxiang Nie, Heyan Huang, Xian-Ling Mao. *SciMRC: Multi-perspective Scientific Machine Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year], [Pages]. [Publisher].

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for **SciMRC** as it is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for **SciMRC** and ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
