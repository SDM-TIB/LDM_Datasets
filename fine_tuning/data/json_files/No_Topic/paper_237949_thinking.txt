To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning in Mining Biological Data" by Mufti Mahmud et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of deep learning to biological data, which suggests that datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that explicitly mention datasets**, particularly the sections that discuss applications of deep learning to biological sequences, images, and signals. I will look for tables or lists that summarize datasets used in the studies mentioned.

In the **section titled "Open Access Biological Data Sources,"** I will find a comprehensive list of datasets categorized under different domains such as Omics, Imaging, and [Brain/Body]-Machine Interfaces. Each dataset will typically include a brief description and its intended application.

For example, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **TCGA database**: This dataset contains genomic data for cancer research, specifically over two petabytes of data generated by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute. The citation for this dataset is:
   > The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). *The Cancer Genome Atlas Home Page*. [Online]. Available: https://cancergenome.nih.gov/

2. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: This dataset includes over 135,000 entries of proteins, nucleic acids, and complex assemblies, which are crucial for understanding biomedicine. The citation is:
   > RCSB Protein Data Bank. *RCSB PDB*. [Online]. Available: https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do#Category-download

3. **ENCODE**: The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements provides genome datasets and metadata for human and mouse studies. The citation is:
   > ENCODE. *Encyclopedia of DNA Elements*. [Online]. Available: https://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/

4. **ADNI dataset**: This dataset is part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which includes data for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease. The citation is:
   > Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). *ADNI datasets*. [Online]. Available: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/

5. **DEAP dataset**: This dataset is used for emotion analysis using physiological signals, including EEG and sEMG data. The citation is:
   > Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP). *DEAP Dataset*. [Online]. Available: http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing. I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for any required output or further processing.
