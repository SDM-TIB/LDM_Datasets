To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of Machine Learning Models in Food Authentication Studies" by Manokamna Singh and Dr. Katarina Domijan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves three near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic datasets related to food authentication, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology** section, particularly subsection A, which explicitly lists the three datasets used in the study: 

1. **Meat Dataset**: This dataset consists of 231 samples with 1051 features, classified into 5 species: beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and turkey.
2. **Olive Oil Dataset**: This dataset includes 65 samples with 1051 features, classified into 3 geographic origins: Crete, Peloponnese, and Other.
3. **Honey Dataset**: This dataset contains 478 samples with 700 features, classified into 4 categories: pure honey and three types of adulterated honey (fully-inverted beet syrup, fructose:glucose mixtures, and high fructose corn syrup).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Meat Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McElhinney, G. Downey, and T. Fearn. "Chemometric processing of visible and near infrared reflectance spectra for species identification in selected raw homogenised meats." *Journal of Near Infrared Spectroscopy*, vol. 7, pp. 145–154, 1999.

- For the **Honey Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Downey, V. Fouratier, and J. D. Kelly. "Detection of honey adulteration by addition of fructose and glucose using near infrared transreflectance spectroscopy." *Journal of Near Infrared Spectroscopy*, vol. 11, pp. 447–456, 2003.

- For the **Olive Oil Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Downey, P. McIntyre, and A. N. Davies. "Geographic classification of extra virgin olive oils from the eastern Mediterranean by chemometric analysis of visible and near-infrared spectroscopic data." *Applied Spectroscopy*, vol. 57, pp. 158–163, 2003.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their authoritative references.
