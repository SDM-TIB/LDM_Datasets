To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-Context Translation: Towards Unifying Image Recognition, Processing, and Generation" by Han Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors unify various vision tasks and indicates that experiments were conducted on multiple benchmarks. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized for their experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their configurations.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention six datasets used across ten vision tasks:

1. **ADE20K**: A dataset for semantic segmentation tasks, containing 20,210 training images and 2,000 testing images.
2. **NYUv2**: Another dataset for depth estimation, with 24,231 training images and 654 testing images.
3. **COCO**: A widely used dataset for various vision tasks, including keypoint detection, with 149,781 training images and 6,352 testing images.
4. **Merged Deraining Datasets**: This dataset is used for image deraining tasks, comprising 13,712 training images and 4,300 testing images.
5. **SIDD**: A dataset for image denoising, containing 96,000 training images and 1,280 testing images.
6. **LoL**: A dataset for low-light image enhancement, with 485 training images and 15 testing images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
