To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEN12MS – A Curated Dataset of Georeferenced Multi-Spectral Sentinel-1/2 Imagery for Deep Learning and Data Fusion" by M. Schmitt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the availability of a dataset consisting of **180,662 triplets of dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image patches, multi-spectral Sentinel-2 image patches, and MODIS land cover maps**. This indicates that there are at least three datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the **Datasets** section (Section 4) provides a comprehensive description of the SEN12MS dataset, which is the primary focus of the paper.

1. **SEN12MS Dataset**: This dataset contains **180,662 triplets** of images, including:
   - **Sentinel-1 dual-pol SAR images**: These are high-resolution radar images.
   - **Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images**: These images provide detailed spectral information.
   - **MODIS land cover maps**: These maps provide land cover classification information.

The paper states that the dataset is designed to support deep learning applications in remote sensing, particularly for tasks like scene classification and semantic segmentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper itself serves as the primary citation for the SEN12MS dataset, as it is newly introduced in this work. The citation for the paper is:

DOI: [insert DOI if available].

Additionally, the paper references the original datasets used to create the SEN12MS dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
