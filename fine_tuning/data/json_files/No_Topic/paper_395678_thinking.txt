To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking the Localization in Weakly Supervised Object Localization" by Yong Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on two widely used datasets: **CUB-200-2011** and **ImageNet-1K**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. Here, they describe:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images, annotated with bounding boxes and class labels for 200 bird species. 

2. **ImageNet-1K**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images, with each image assigned one class and labeled with one or more bounding boxes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > C. Wah, S. Branson, P. Welinder, P. Perona, and S. Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology, 2011.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. IJCV 115, 3 (2015), 211â€“252.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
