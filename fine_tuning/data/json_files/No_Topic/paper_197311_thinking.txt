To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressive Shift Retrieval" by Henrik Ohlsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, there may not be a specific section labeled "Datasets," so I will need to pay close attention to any references to datasets throughout the text.

As I read, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly named or described. For example, if the authors mention using specific datasets for their experiments or simulations, I will highlight those.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

In the case of this paper, I will look for any datasets that might be referenced in the context of compressive sensing or shift retrieval. If the authors refer to datasets used in previous works, I will ensure to cite those original papers as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the citations are formatted correctly according to academic standards.
