To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unanimity of Two Selves in Decision Making" by Pierre Bardier, Bach Dong-Xuan, and Van-Quy Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a **dedicated section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, there may not be a clearly labeled section for datasets, so I will need to look for mentions of data sources or datasets within the text. I will pay attention to any references to empirical studies, experiments, or data collection methods that might indicate the use of specific datasets.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of observations, variables included, or the context in which they were used. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets used in the research. 

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Dataset A" used for analysis, I will look for the citation that provides the authors, title, publication details, and any other relevant information.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited according to academic standards. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
