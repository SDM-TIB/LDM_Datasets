To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised-learning-based Optimal Thermal Management in an Electric Vehicle" by Youngjin Kim, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine **section II (ANN-based Thermal Management)** and **section IV (Case Studies and Results)**, as these sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any specific mentions of the number of samples, types of data collected, and the conditions under which the data was gathered.

In **section IV (Case Studies and Results)**, the author discusses the training and testing datasets used for the ANN models. I will note the specifics of the datasets, including the number of samples and the conditions under which they were collected. For example, the paper mentions that the total number of historical data for the integrated mode was estimated to be 1009 and for the separate mode, it was 2959.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. If the datasets are derived from previous studies or publicly available datasets, I will ensure to document the full citations for those sources.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset** (if explicitly mentioned).
2. **Description** of the dataset, including the context of its use (e.g., training or testing).
3. **Number of samples** and any relevant characteristics (e.g., conditions under which data was collected).
4. **Full citation** for the dataset or the source from which it was derived.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry is clearly articulated and properly cited, as this is crucial for the integrity of the research and for future reference by other researchers. This structured approach will help me effectively extract and document the datasets from the paper.
