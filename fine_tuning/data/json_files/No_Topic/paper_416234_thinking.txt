To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting" by Guikun Chen and Wenguan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but specific datasets are often detailed in the methods or results sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Application Areas and Tasks)**, which discusses various applications of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Here, the authors mention several datasets used in their evaluations. I will take note of any datasets explicitly named, along with their descriptions.

In **section 5 (Performance Comparison)**, the authors provide quantitative results based on specific datasets. This section is crucial as it often includes datasets used for benchmarking the methods discussed in the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Replica Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating SLAM systems. It consists of 18 highly detailed 3D indoor scenes, which are essential for advancing research in machine learning and computer vision.

2. **D-NeRF Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating models in monocular settings with varied camera poses. It includes videos with synthetic, animated objects in complex scenes.

3. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for autonomous driving research, featuring 1000 driving scenes captured using various sensors.

4. **ZJU-MoCap Dataset**: This dataset is used for human modeling from videos, captured with synchronized cameras.

   Full citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is accurately cited according to the standards of academic writing. This will facilitate further research and provide a clear resource for readers interested in the datasets used in the paper.
