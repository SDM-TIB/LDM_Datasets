To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Defense Against Backdoor Attacks in Continual Federated Learning" by Shuaiqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their framework on **four datasets**: EMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. I will note down these datasets and look for detailed descriptions in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset. For instance, they describe the EMNIST dataset as an extension of MNIST for handwritten letters, and CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 as standard datasets for image classification tasks. Tiny ImageNet is also mentioned as a dataset used for image recognition.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **EMNIST Dataset**:
   > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and Andre Van Schaik. *EMNIST: Extending MNIST to Handwritten Letters*. In 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pages 2921â€“2926, 2017.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

4. **Tiny ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
