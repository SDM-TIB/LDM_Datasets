To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Virtual Proximity Citation (VCP): A Supervised Deep Learning Method to Relate Uncited Papers On Grounds of Citation Proximity" by Rohit Rawat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, but the methodology and dataset sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of citation-based approaches and introduces the VCP method. However, no specific datasets are mentioned here, so I will move on.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.2 Dataset**. Here, the author states that the VCP neural network is trained using data from co-cited articles along with citation proximity information. The paper mentions that the dataset is derived from Wikipedia dumps dated January 1, 2019, which consists of titles, texts, distances between citations, counts, and CPI values.

The author also references a tool called **Citolytics** used to calculate the necessary metrics for the dataset. This indicates that the dataset is based on co-cited articles from Wikipedia, which is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for the dataset mentioned. The author refers to a previous work by Paul Molloy, which is essential for citing the dataset correctly. The citation provided in the references section is:

- For the dataset created by Molloy P:
  > Paul Molloy, Joeran Beel, and Akiko Aizawa. *Virtual Citation Proximity (VCP): Learning a Hypothetical In-Text Citation-Proximity Metric For Uncited Documents*. OSF Preprints. doi:10.31219/osf.io/t5aqf. 2020.

This citation is important as it provides the source of the dataset used in the VCP research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset's origin and its relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
