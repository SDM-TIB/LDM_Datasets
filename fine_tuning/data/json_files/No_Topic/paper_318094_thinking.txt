To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STALP: Style Transfer with Auxiliary Limited Pairing" by D. Futschik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and applications, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior research.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe various applications of their method, such as video stylization, style transfer to 3D models, and portrait stylization. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these contexts.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **set of photos taken from the same location** for panorama stylization and a **set of portraits taken under similar lighting conditions** for portrait stylization. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets, which means I need to look for references in the **References section** to find authoritative citations.

In the **References section**, I will search for any papers that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. For example, if the authors refer to datasets like the FFHQ dataset or any other well-known datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets and their citations. If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note that and mention the general types of datasets used (e.g., "set of photos from the same location" or "set of portraits under similar lighting conditions") without specific citations.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes a clear description and the full citation for any referenced datasets, formatted correctly for clarity and accuracy. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and useful for future reference or research.
