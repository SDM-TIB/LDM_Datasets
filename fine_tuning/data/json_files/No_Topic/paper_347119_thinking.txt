To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Waypoint Generation in Row-based Crops with Deep Learning and Contrastive Clustering" by Francesco Salvetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information and provide full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setting)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention the creation of synthetic datasets and the use of manually annotated real images. I will extract the details of these datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a method for generating synthetic occupancy grids for training. They mention that this dataset consists of 3000 images for training, 300 for validation, and 1000 for testing, specifically designed to include both straight and curved rows.

2. **Real Dataset**: The authors also mention manually annotated real row-based images of vineyards and orchards sourced from Google Maps, consisting of 100 straight and 50 curved images. This dataset is crucial for testing the model's generalization to real-world scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. Since the synthetic dataset is generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation, but I will ensure to note the methodology used for its creation. For the real dataset, I will look for any references that might provide context or prior work related to the images used.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations where applicable. For the synthetic dataset, I will describe the generation process as outlined in the paper, and for the real dataset, I will note the source (Google Maps) and the number of images.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
