To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StereoKG: Data-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction for Cultural Knowledge and Stereotypes" by Awantee Deshpande et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study presents a knowledge graph (KG) covering cultural knowledge and stereotypes, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in its construction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Knowledge Graph Construction)**, where the authors detail their methodology for creating the knowledge graph. They mention that the KG consists of entries collected from **Reddit and Twitter**, specifically targeting cultural knowledge and stereotypes related to 5 religious groups and 5 nationalities. This indicates that the data sources themselves are important datasets.

In this section, the authors state that they mined **11,259 questions and statements** from these platforms, which are crucial for the construction of the knowledge graph. However, they do not provide a formal dataset name for this collection, so I will refer to it as the **StereoKG Dataset** for the purpose of documentation.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in their experiments, particularly in **section 5 (Knowledge Integration)**, where they mention using the **OLID dataset** for hate speech detection and the **White Supremacy Forum (WSF) dataset** as an out-of-domain dataset. Both of these datasets are explicitly named and are relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

1. **StereoKG Dataset**: This dataset is not formally cited in the references, but it is derived from the authors' own work and methodology described in the paper. Therefore, I will note it as:
   > Deshpande, A., Ruiter, D., Mosbach, M., & Klakow, D. (2023). StereoKG: Data-Driven Knowledge Graph Construction for Cultural Knowledge and Stereotypes. Saarland University.

2. **OLID Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zampieri, M., Malmasi, S., Nakov, P., Rosenthal, S., Farra, N., & Kumar, R. (2019). Predicting the type and target of offensive posts in social media. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 1415–1420, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **WSF Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > de Gibert, O., Perez, N., García-Pablos, A., & Cuadros, M. (2018). Hate Speech Dataset from a White Supremacy Forum. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Abusive Language Online (ALW2), pages 11–20, Brussels, Belgium. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
