To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Sampling-and-Learning Framework: A Statistical View of Evolutionary Algorithms" by Yang Yu and Hong Qian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and their applications, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then proceed to the **methodology section** where they describe the sampling-and-learning (SAL) framework and its evaluation.

Next, I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as **"Datasets"** or similar. If such a section is not present, I will check the **experiments or results sections** for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used in their experiments. However, they refer to various evolutionary algorithms and their theoretical performance without providing empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references to other works. If there are no datasets mentioned, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.

In this case, since the paper lacks specific datasets, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to extract. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references and format them accordingly.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were identified in this paper, and document this in a structured manner for future reference.
