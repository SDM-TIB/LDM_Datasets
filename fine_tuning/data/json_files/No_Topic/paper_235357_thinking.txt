To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions Dataset" by Matthew Pitropov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset**, which is the primary dataset of interest. It describes the dataset's focus on adverse driving conditions and provides some initial details about its contents.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (which is likely to be labeled as such) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this case, the CADC dataset is described in detail, including the number of frames, the types of sensors used, and the specific conditions under which the data was collected.

In the **Related Datasets section**, the authors mention several other datasets for context, such as the **KITTI dataset**, **Oxford RoboCar Dataset**, and others. However, my primary focus will remain on the CADC dataset, as it is the main dataset presented in this paper.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CADC dataset itself does not have a separate citation since it is the focus of the paper, but I will ensure to note any references to other datasets that are discussed in relation to CADC.

The full citation for the CADC dataset, as it appears in the paper, is:
> Pitropov, M., Garcia, D., Rebello, J., Smart, M., Wang, C., Czarnecki, K., & Waslander, S. (2020). Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions Dataset. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2020.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CADC dataset and any other relevant datasets mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research.
