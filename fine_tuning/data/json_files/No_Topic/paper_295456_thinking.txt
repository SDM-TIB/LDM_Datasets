To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A survey of image labelling for computer vision applications" by Christoph Sager, Christian Janiesch, and Patrick Zschech, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for large amounts of labeled training data for supervised machine learning in computer vision, which suggests that datasets are likely to be referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that detail the survey process and findings**. In particular, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize datasets or tools used in image labeling. The paper mentions various image labeling software and tools, which may imply the datasets they utilize or generate.

In **section 4 (Concepts and features of image labelling software)**, the authors provide an overview of several image labeling tools. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in relation to these tools. For instance, if a tool is described as being used for a particular dataset, I will note that down.

I will also check the **References section** for any citations that might refer to datasets. If the authors mention datasets in the context of specific studies or tools, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe those datasets to obtain full citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the paper mentions the **ImageNet dataset**, I will look for the original citation, which is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 248â€“255. doi:10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
