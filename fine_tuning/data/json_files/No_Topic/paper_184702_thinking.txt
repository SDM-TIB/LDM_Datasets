To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Presentation Attack Rejection by Analyzing Polarization Hypotheses" by Ethan M. Rudd, Manuel GÃ¼nther, and Terrance E. Boult, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the PARAPH system and its evaluation using various presentation attack media, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention conducting tests using "high quality printed images on matte paper, high quality printed images on glossy paper, and videos taken from LCD monitors." This indicates that they used specific types of media for their evaluation, but I need to determine if these are part of a formal dataset or if they are custom datasets created for this study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited that may have been used in their experiments. The authors reference several works related to face anti-spoofing, but I need to identify if any of these references correspond to datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention a formal dataset for their experiments. Instead, they describe the media types used for testing, which are not formal datasets but rather examples of presentation attacks.

Since there are no formal datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors conducted their own small-scale tests rather than using established datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the media types used in their evaluation without formal citations, as they do not correspond to recognized datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the findings into a structured format, noting the types of media used for evaluation, but I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets since none were formally referenced in the paper.
