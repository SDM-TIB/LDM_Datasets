To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bold but Cautious: Unlocking the Potential of Personalized Federated Learning through Cautiously Aggressive Collaboration" by Xinghao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments: 

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.

I will also check the **implementation details** section for any additional information about the datasets, such as how they were partitioned or any specific preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, 2010.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
