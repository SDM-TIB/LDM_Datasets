To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised Convex Clustering" by Minjie Wang, Tianyi Yao, and Genevera I. Allen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **case study section (Section 4)**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in practical applications. In this section, the authors mention using data from the **Religious Orders Study Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)**, which is a significant dataset for their analysis of Alzheimer's Disease.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if there are specific datasets used for simulations. The authors describe various simulation setups, but they do not explicitly name additional datasets beyond ROSMAP.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the ROSMAP dataset is as follows:
- For the ROSMAP dataset, the citation is:
  > Bennett, D. A., Buchman, A. S., Boyle, P. A., Barnes, L. L., Wilson, R. S., & Schneider, J. A. (2018). Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. *Journal of Alzheimer's Disease*, 64(s1), 161-189. doi:10.3233/JAD-179939.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ROSMAP dataset and does not mention other datasets explicitly, I will compile this information.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
