To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel Bi-Linear Modeling for Reconstructing Data on Manifolds: The Dynamic-MRI Case" by Gaurav N. Shetty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the methodology is validated on synthetically generated dMRI data, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Numerical Results)**, where the authors discuss the validation of their framework. They mention that the proposed framework is validated on the **magnetic-resonance extended cardiac-torso (MRXCAT) cine phantom**. This is a specific dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the authors provide details about the MRXCAT dataset, including its spatial size and the number of frames. They state that the data has a spatial resolution of 1.56 × 1.56 mm² for a field-of-view of 400×400 mm² and consists of 15 cardiac cycles and 24 cardiac phases. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MRXCAT dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MRXCAT cine phantom**, the citation is:
  > L. Wissmann, C. Santelli, W. P. Segars, and S. Kozerke. *MRXCAT: Realistic numerical phantoms for cardiovascular magnetic resonance*. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, vol. 16, no. 1, p. 63, 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MRXCAT dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MRXCAT cine phantom, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
