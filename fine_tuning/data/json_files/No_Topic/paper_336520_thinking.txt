To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kalman Filter Design for Intermittent Optical Wireless Communication Systems on Time Scales" by Wenqi Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the design of a Kalman filter for an intermittent optical wireless communication system, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Intermittent OWC System)**, which describes the experimental setup and the data collection process. Here, the authors mention that experimental data were collected to determine the time scale's form, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will look for specific details about this dataset.

In **subsection A (Experimental Setup)**, the authors describe the experimental setup for the vibrating optical communication system, but they do not provide a formal dataset name. However, they mention that the received optical power is continuously recorded, which suggests that there is a dataset related to the power measurements over time.

In **subsection B (Model Design)**, the authors provide a relation mapping between received optical power and the relative angle, which is crucial for understanding the dataset. They mention that the mapping is based on 30 sampling points, which indicates that there is a structured dataset derived from these measurements.

In **subsection C (Determine the Time Scale)**, the authors describe how they determined the time scale based on experimental data, but again, they do not provide a formal dataset name. However, they do describe the time intervals and the nature of the measurements, which can be considered part of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that provide datasets related to the experiments conducted in this study. However, it appears that the paper primarily focuses on the theoretical aspects and the application of the Kalman filter rather than providing specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets or provide full citations for them, I will summarize the relevant information I have gathered:

1. **Experimental Data for Intermittent OWC System**: This dataset includes measurements of received optical power over time, collected during experiments with a vibrating optical communication system. The authors describe the nature of the data but do not provide a formal citation.

2. **Mapping of Received Power to Relative Angle**: This dataset is derived from the relationship between the received optical power and the relative angle, based on 30 sampling points. Again, while the authors provide the mapping formula, they do not cite a specific dataset.

In conclusion, while I have identified the types of datasets discussed in the paper, there are no formal dataset names or citations provided. I will note this in my final output, indicating that the datasets are described but not formally cited. This will be important for anyone looking to reference or utilize the data in future research.
