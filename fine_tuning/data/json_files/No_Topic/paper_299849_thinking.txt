To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Dynamic Parallelotope Bundles for Reachability Analysis of Nonlinear Systems" by Edward Kim, Stanley Bak, and Parasara Sridhar Duggirala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a tool called Kaa and mentions improvements on several standard nonlinear benchmark systems, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section**, specifically **Table 1**, which summarizes five standard benchmarks used for experimentation. This table provides key information about the models used, including their dimensions and parameters, which indicates that these models are likely based on specific datasets.

The models listed in Table 1 are:

1. **Vanderpol**: A nonlinear system with specific parameters for testing.
2. **Jet Engine**: Another nonlinear model with defined parameters.
3. **Neuron**: A model referenced in the context of neural dynamics.
4. **SIR**: A classic epidemiological model.
5. **Coupled Vanderpol**: A variation of the Vanderpol model.
6. **COVID Supermodel**: A modified SIR model accounting for asymptomatic patients.

In the **COVID Supermodel** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the model dynamics, including parameters such as infection probability and removal rates. This indicates that the COVID Supermodel is based on a dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or models mentioned. The references may provide insights into the original sources of the datasets used for the benchmarks.

For the models mentioned, I will look for citations that correspond to each model:

- For the **Vanderpol model**, I will refer to the original paper by FitzHugh (1961) as it is commonly associated with this model.
- The **SIR model** is a well-known epidemiological model, and I will cite the foundational work on this model.
- The **COVID Supermodel** references works by Ansumali et al. (2020) and others, which I will include as citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation for the respective dataset or model.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
