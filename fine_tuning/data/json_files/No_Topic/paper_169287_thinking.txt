To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lower Bounds for Higher-Order Convex Optimization" by Naman Agarwal and Elad Hazan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the shift in optimization methods but do not mention any specific datasets. I will then look into the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that might detail experiments or theoretical constructs that could involve datasets.

Next, I will check for any **specific sections labeled as "Datasets" or similar**. If such a section exists, it will likely contain the most relevant information about datasets used in their research. If no dedicated section is present, I will look for mentions of datasets in the context of examples, experiments, or comparisons.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are referenced, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they are used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

If the paper mentions datasets such as "CIFAR-10" or "MNIST," I will ensure to find their full citations. For example, the citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future use or analysis.
