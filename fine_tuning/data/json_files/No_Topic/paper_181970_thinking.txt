To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GTApprox: surrogate modeling for industrial design" by Mikhail Belyaev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tool and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Comparison with alternative algorithms on test problems)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using a collection of test problems, including both explicit formulas and real-world datasets. This section is likely to contain the names of the datasets used for benchmarking.

In this section, the authors state that they used datasets from the **UCI repository** and the **GdR Mascot-Num benchmark**. I will note these as they are significant sources of datasets.

Now, I will look for specific references to datasets within the **References section**. The authors mention that detailed descriptions or references for the test problems can be found in the GTApprox documentation. I will need to check the documentation for the exact datasets used in their experiments.

The references to look for include:
- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: This is a well-known source for various datasets used in machine learning research. The citation is:
  > M. Lichman, UCI machine learning repository, 2013.

- **GdR Mascot-Num Benchmark**: This benchmark is also referenced, and I will need to find its citation. The citation is:
  > Gdr mascot-num benchmark, http://www.gdr-mascotnum.fr/benchmarks.html, 2016.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to include their full citations as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ready for review or further processing.
