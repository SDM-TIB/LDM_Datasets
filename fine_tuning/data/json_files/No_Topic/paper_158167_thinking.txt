To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Feature Aggregation and Image Re-ranking with Heat Diffusion for Image Retrieval" by Shanmin Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "common public benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section** (Section V), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Oxford Buildings (Oxford5k)**: This dataset contains 5,062 photographs of 11 different Oxford landmarks, with 55 query images provided for evaluation.

2. **Paris (Paris6k)**: This dataset consists of 6,392 high-resolution images of Paris, also with 55 query images and corresponding ground truth relevant images.

3. **INRIA Holidays (Holidays)**: This dataset includes 1,491 images, with 500 images selected as queries.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Oxford5k**, the citation is:
  > J. Philbin, O. Chum, M. Isard, J. Sivic, and A. Zisserman. "Object retrieval with large vocabularies and fast spatial matching." In 20th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 18-23, 2007, pp. 1–8.

- For **Paris6k**, the citation is:
  > J. Philbin, O. Chum, M. Isard, J. Sivic, and A. Zisserman. "Lost in quantization: Improving particular object retrieval in large scale image databases." In 21st IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Anchorage, Alaska, June 23-28, 2008, pp. 1–8.

- For **Holidays**, the citation is:
  > H. Jégou, M. Douze, and C. Schmid. "Improving bag-of-features for large scale image search." International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 87, no. 3, pp. 316–336, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
