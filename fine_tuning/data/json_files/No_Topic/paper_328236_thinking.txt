To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 forecasting using new viral variants and vaccination effectiveness models" by Essam A. Rashed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for the analysis. In this case, the authors discuss using data from regions with high vaccination rates, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Data)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they outline various datasets, including:

1. **Current state data**: This includes daily numbers of positive cases, serious cases, hospitalized cases, deaths, and daily hospital discharged cases.
2. **Mobility data**: This dataset consists of various mobility metrics such as retail & recreation, grocery & pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residences.
3. **Meteorological data**: This includes daily maximum and minimum temperatures and daily average humidity.
4. **Day labels**: This dataset categorizes days as working days or holidays.
5. **Variant infectivity**: This dataset includes a normalized infectivity index computed using the percentage of viral variants.
6. **Behavior data**: This includes tweets related to social activities that may influence COVID-19 transmission.

The authors also mention that vaccination data was collected from external regions, specifically Tel Aviv, Israel, which is crucial for understanding the context of their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the authors reference data from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Google mobility reports, and the Japan Meteorological Agency. I will ensure to note down the complete citations for these sources.

For the **Tel Aviv data**, I will also look for the specific source mentioned in the paper, which is an online open source.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as its content, scale, and relevance to the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
