To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformation-Compensated Learning for Image Reconstruction without Ground Truth" by Weijie Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on both simulated and experimentally collected MRI data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental validation section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention using the **OASIS-3 dataset** for simulating measurements. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

In **Section 4.2.1**, the authors specify that they used T1-weighted MR brain acquisitions of 60 subjects from the OASIS-3 dataset. This section provides a clear description of the dataset used for their simulations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OASIS-3 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> P. J. LaMontagne, T. L. Benzinger, J. C. Morris, S. Keefe, R. Hornbeck, C. Xiong, E. Grant, J. Hassenstab, K. Moulder, A. Vlassenko et al. "OASIS-3: Longitudinal neuroimaging, clinical, and cognitive dataset for normal aging and Alzheimer disease." MedRxiv 2019.12.13.19014902, 2019.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **Section 4.3.1**, the authors mention using the second MR acquisitions of the same 60 subjects from the OASIS-3 dataset as the deformed images. This reinforces the importance of the OASIS-3 dataset in their experiments.

After reviewing the paper, I conclude that the only dataset explicitly mentioned is the OASIS-3 dataset. I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output with the correct citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the OASIS-3 dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
