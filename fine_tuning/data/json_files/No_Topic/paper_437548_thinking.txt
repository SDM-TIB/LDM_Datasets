To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrossCheckGPT: Universal Hallucination Ranking for Multimodal Foundation Models" by Guangzhi Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of "AVHalluBench," which suggests that there are specific datasets being discussed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe the **AVHalluBench** dataset in detail, which is crucial for my extraction.

1. **AVHalluBench**: This dataset is introduced as the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, containing 175 videos selected from six video understanding datasets. It includes various styles and elements, with a focus on audio and visual descriptions. The authors provide statistics about the dataset, such as the number of videos and average lengths.

2. **WikiBio**: The paper also references the **WikiBio** dataset, which is used for text-to-text experiments. This dataset contains 238 biographical passages from Wikipedia and is crucial for evaluating the hallucination ranking methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AVHalluBench**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is introduced in the paper itself, and while it may not have a separate citation, it is essential to note that it is a novel contribution of this research.

- For **WikiBio**, the citation is:
  > Manakul, P., Liusie, A., & Gales, M. (2023). SelfCheckGPT: Zero-resource black-box hallucination detection for generative large language models. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 9004â€“9017). Association for Computational Linguistics. doi:10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.557.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper.
