To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impedance Reshaping Method of DFIG System Based on Compensating Rotor Current Dynamic to Eliminate PLL Influence" by Xiaoling Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup and any datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by DFIG systems and the methods proposed to address these issues. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this stage. I will then proceed to the **methodology** section, where the authors describe their simulation setup and the parameters used.

In **section IV (Simulation Verification)**, the authors mention that simulations were carried out based on MATLAB/Simulink, and they refer to a table (Table I) that lists the parameters of the DFIG system used in the simulations. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference. Instead, they describe the parameters used for the simulations, which are crucial for replicating the study but do not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

Next, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the simulation results. The authors present various figures and tables that illustrate the performance of their proposed methods, but again, they do not mention any external datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references primarily consist of other research papers that may have used datasets relevant to DFIG systems, but they do not provide direct access to datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets by name or provide citations for datasets, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. Instead, the focus is on the simulation parameters and results derived from the authors' own modeling efforts.

In summary, I will document the following:

1. **No specific datasets were identified in the paper.**
2. **The parameters used for simulations are listed in Table I, but they do not constitute a dataset.**
3. **The references do not provide direct citations for datasets.**

This approach ensures that I thoroughly examined the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable.
