To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Joint Cascade Regression Framework for Simultaneous Facial Action Unit Recognition and Facial Landmark Detection" by Yue Wu and Qiang Ji, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of facial action unit recognition and facial landmark detection, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets that might be used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will check **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+)**: This dataset contains 593 facial activity videos from 210 subjects, with peak frames coded for 30 facial action units. The authors manually labeled 28 facial landmarks on the peak frames.

2. **SEMAINE Database**: This dataset includes emotionally colored conversations between human subjects and machine agents, with facial activity naturally induced. The authors coded FACS for 180 images from 8 sessions and manually labeled 28 facial landmarks.

3. **FERA Database**: This dataset consists of 87 action unit-related sequences of 7 actors, with 50 action unit annotations provided for each frame. The authors also manually annotated 28 facial landmarks on 260 frames for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+)**, the citation is:
  > P. Lucey, J. Cohn, T. Kanade, J. Saragih, Z. Ambadar, and I. Matthews. *The Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+): A Complete Dataset for Action Unit and Emotion-Specified Expression*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), pages 94–101, June 2010.

- For the **SEMAINE Database**, the citation is:
  > G. McKeown, M. Valstar, R. Cowie, M. Pantic, and M. Schroder. *The SEMAINE Database: Annotated Multimodal Records of Emotionally Colored Conversations Between a Person and a Limited Agent*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 3(1):5–17, 2012.

- For the **FERA Database**, the citation is:
  > M. Valstar, B. Jiang, M. Mehu, M. Pantic, and K. Scherer. *The First Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition and Workshops (FG), pages 921–926, March 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
