To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series" by Margaux Zaffran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions conducting a real case study on **electricity price forecasting**, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to electricity prices.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and may provide details about the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize dataset characteristics.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to the datasets again while discussing their findings. I will note any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned here.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

From my reading, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **French Electricity Spot Prices Dataset**: This dataset is used for forecasting electricity prices and is described in detail in section 6.1. The authors mention that it contains prices set by an auction market from 2016 to 2019, with a total of 35,064 observations.

2. **Synthetic Datasets for Experiments**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, specifically using ARMA(1,1) processes. While these datasets may not have formal citations, I will note the methodology used to create them.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **French Electricity Spot Prices Dataset**, the citation is:
  > EUPHEMIA (2019). Euphemia public description, single price coupling algorithm.

- For the **synthetic datasets**, since they are generated by the authors, I will note:
  > Zaffran, M., Dieuleveut, A., Feron, O., Goude, Y., & Josse, J. (2022). Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.12827*.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
