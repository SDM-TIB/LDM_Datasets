To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Bearing Equivalence in Directed Graphs" by Zhiyong Sun, Shiyu Zhao, and Daniel Zelazo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may reference prior works that utilized specific datasets, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for sections that specifically mention datasets, such as **"Data" or "Experiments"**. In this paper, I will pay close attention to any examples or illustrations that might indicate the use of datasets. If the authors provide examples of directed graphs or formations, I will check if they reference any datasets used to generate these examples.

I will also examine the **References section** to find any citations that might correspond to datasets. If the authors refer to datasets from previous studies, I will need to ensure I capture the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

If the paper includes any figures or tables that summarize data or results, I will analyze these as they may contain implicit references to datasets. 

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. For instance, if the paper references a dataset used in previous works, I will ensure to include the original citation for that dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
