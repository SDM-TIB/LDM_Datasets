To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Spontaneity to Improve Emotion Recognition in Speech" by Karttikeya Mangalam and Tanaya Guha, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **IEMOCAP database**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They explicitly mention using the **USC-IEMOCAP database** for performance evaluation, detailing its characteristics, such as containing 12 hours of audiovisual data collected from dyadic conversations, which are labeled as either spontaneous or scripted.

In this section, they also describe how the data is organized and labeled for emotion recognition tasks, which further confirms the significance of the IEMOCAP database in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP database. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **IEMOCAP Database**:
  > C. Busso, M. Bulut, C. Lee, A. Kazemzadeh, E. Mower, S. Kim, J. Chang, S. Lee, and S. Narayanan. "IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database." *Language Resources and Evaluation*, vol. 42, no. 4, pp. 335â€“359, 2008.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the IEMOCAP database, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the IEMOCAP database, ensuring to include the full citation as it is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.
