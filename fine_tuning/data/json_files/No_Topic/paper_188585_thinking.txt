To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supersizing Self-supervision: Learning to Grasp from 50K Tries and 700 Robot Hours" by Lerrel Pinto and Abhinav Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset of **50K data points** from **700 hours of robot grasping attempts**, which suggests a significant dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the data collection process. The authors mention that they collected data through **trial and error experiments** using a Baxter robot, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In the **results section**, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of positive and negative samples, which further confirms the dataset's size and structure. They mention that the dataset consists of **50,567 total data points**, which includes various grasp attempts on **150 objects**.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will note that the dataset does not have a separate citation but is described in detail within the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Grasp Dataset**: This dataset contains over **50,000 data points** collected from **trial and error grasping attempts** using the Baxter robot. It includes both successful and unsuccessful grasp attempts across various objects in cluttered environments.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the **Grasp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lerrel Pinto and Abhinav Gupta. *Supersizing Self-supervision: Learning to Grasp from 50K Tries and 700 Robot Hours*. The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
