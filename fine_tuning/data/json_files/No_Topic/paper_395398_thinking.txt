To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Driving Without Ethics: Meaning, Design and Real-World Implementation" by Katherine Evans et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the ethical implications of automated vehicles but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of artificial intelligence on moral values but do not provide any dataset names. I will continue to the **methodology and implementation sections**, where the authors might describe the datasets used for their experiments or analyses.

As I read through the **implementation section**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the development or testing of their proposed Ethical Valence Theory (EVT) or any algorithms related to automated vehicles. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation for each dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If I find any datasets, I will document them carefully, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references. If no datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
