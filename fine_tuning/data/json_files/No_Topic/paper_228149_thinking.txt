To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artistic Glyph Image Synthesis via One-Stage Few-Shot Learning" by Yue Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a large-scale dataset with Chinese glyph images, which indicates that there are datasets relevant to the research. The introduction further emphasizes the need for datasets in the context of artistic font design, hinting at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Chinese Glyph Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,571,940 glyph images covering 2,460 synthetic artistic font styles and 35 professional-designed fonts. This dataset is crucial for validating the effectiveness of their proposed method.

2. **English Glyph Image Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being proposed by Azadi et al. (2018) and contains 32,046 synthetic artistic fonts, each with 26 glyphs. This dataset is used for pre-training the model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Chinese Glyph Image Dataset**, since it is created by the authors themselves, I will note that it is a new dataset introduced in this paper and does not have a separate citation.

- For the **English Glyph Image Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Samaneh Azadi, Matthew Fisher, Vladimir G Kim, Zhaowen Wang, Eli Shechtman, and Trevor Darrell. *Multi-content gan for few-shot font style transfer*. In CVPR, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Chinese Glyph Image Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors containing 1,571,940 glyph images across 2,460 styles and 35 fonts. (No separate citation as it is original to this paper).

2. **English Glyph Image Dataset**: 
   > Azadi et al. (2018). *Multi-content gan for few-shot font style transfer*. In CVPR, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
