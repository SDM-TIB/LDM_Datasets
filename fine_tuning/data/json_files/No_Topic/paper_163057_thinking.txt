To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Deep Residual Networks for Human Action Recognition from Skeletal Data" by Huy-Hieu Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Criteria)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MSR Action 3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 different action classes performed by 10 subjects, totaling 557 valid skeleton sequences. The authors provide a link to access the dataset.

2. **Kinect Activity Recognition Dataset (KARD)**: This dataset contains 18 actions performed by 10 subjects, with a total of 540 skeleton sequences. The authors also provide a link for accessing this dataset.

3. **NTU-RGB+D Action Recognition Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale dataset with over 56,000 video samples and 4 million frames, collected from 40 subjects for 60 different action classes. The authors provide a link to access this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MSR Action 3D Dataset**:
  > Li, W., Zhang, Z., & Liu, Z. (2010). Action recognition based on a bag of 3D points. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 9-14.

- For **Kinect Activity Recognition Dataset (KARD)**:
  > Gaglio, S., Re, G. L., & Morana, M. (2015). Human activity recognition process using 3-D posture data. IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems, 45(5), 586-597.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
