To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Individual Treatment Effects under Heterogeneous Interference in Networks" by Ziyu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **four benchmark datasets**. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned in the **experiments section**:

1. **BlogCatalog**: A dataset representing a network of social relationships among bloggers. It is used to analyze social interactions and their effects on treatment outcomes.

2. **Flickr**: This dataset consists of an online social network where users share images and videos. The dataset is constructed by forming links between images that share common metadata.

3. **Hamsterster**: A dataset that captures friendships and family links among users of the Hamsterster website, providing insights into social connections and their influence on treatment effects.

4. **Fb-pages-tvshow**: This dataset represents blue-verified Facebook page networks across different categories, where nodes represent pages and edges represent mutual likes among them.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **BlogCatalog**: 
  > Rossi, R. A., & Ahmed, N. K. (2016). An interactive data repository with visual analytics. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 17(2), 37-41.

- **Flickr**:

- **Fb-pages-tvshow**: 
  > Rossi, R. A., & Ahmed, N. K. (2016). An interactive data repository with visual analytics. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 17(2), 37-41.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
