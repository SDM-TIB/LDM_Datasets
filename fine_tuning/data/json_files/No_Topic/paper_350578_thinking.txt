To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransCL: Transformer Makes Strong and Flexible Compressive Learning" by Chong Mou and Jian Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "large-scale images with arbitrary CS ratios," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention applying their model to two representative high-level vision tasks: **image classification** and **semantic segmentation**. They specifically reference the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet 2012**: This dataset contains 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images from 1,000 categories. It is a widely used benchmark in the image domain.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, but with 100 classes, each containing 500 training images and 100 testing images.

4. **ADE20K**: A challenging benchmark with 150 annotated object categories, containing 20,210 training pairs, 2,000 validation pairs, and 3,352 testing pairs.

5. **Cityscapes**: This dataset has 19 annotated object categories in street scenes from 50 different cities, with 5,000 annotated images.

6. **PASCAL Context**: Contains 60 annotated object categories (59 classes and 1 background) with 4,998 training pairs and 5,105 validation pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
