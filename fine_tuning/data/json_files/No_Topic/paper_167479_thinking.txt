To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why Do Neural Dialog Systems Generate Short and Meaningless Replies? A Comparison between Dialog and Translation" by Bolin Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental protocol sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research question and methodology, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by Seq2Seq models in dialog systems compared to machine translation. They mention the need for empirical verification of their conjecture, which may lead to references of specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Protocol)**, where the authors describe their methodology in detail. Here, they mention using two specific datasets:

1. **Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus**: This dataset is used for the dialog system and contains 221,000 samples of conversations from movie scripts.

2. **WMT-2017 Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation, specifically for English-to-German translation, and contains 5.8 million samples.

To confirm the datasets and gather full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Cristian Rodriguez. *Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus*. Available at: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html.

- For the **WMT-2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. *WMT 2017 Translation Task*. Available at: http://data.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task/preprocessed/de-en/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have successfully extracted the datasets from the paper, ensuring to include their full citations for proper attribution.
