To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Blackbox Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Agents Using Approximated Temporal Information" by Yiren Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of sequence-to-sequence models and mentions evaluating the method on a range of games, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to identify any datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the games used for testing their methods. They mention using three different RL algorithms: DQN, A2C, and Rainbow, and the target games are **Cartpole, Space Invader, and Pong**. 

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of previous research. However, it seems that the focus is more on the methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Now, I will look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or experimental setups. In this case, the paper does not provide specific datasets but rather refers to the environments (games) used for testing their approach.

Since the paper does not provide formal datasets with citations, I will note the games used as the primary datasets for the experiments:

1. **Cartpole**: A classic control problem where the goal is to balance a pole on a cart.
2. **Space Invader**: An arcade game where the player controls a ship to shoot down aliens.
3. **Pong**: A table tennis-themed arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

Next, I will compile the full citations for the foundational papers or frameworks that describe these environments:

- For **Cartpole**, the citation is:
  > OpenAI. *OpenAI Gym*. Available at: https://gym.openai.com/

- For **Space Invader**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Graves, A., Antonoglou, I., Wierstra, D., & Riedmiller, M. (2013). *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.

- For **Pong**, the citation is the same as for Space Invader since it is also part of the Atari games in the OpenAI Gym:
  > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Graves, A., Antonoglou, I., Wierstra, D., & Riedmiller, M. (2013). *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to create structured entries for each dataset based on the information gathered, ensuring that I include the full citations for each game as they are the primary datasets referenced in the paper.
