To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural 3D Strokes: Creating Stylized 3D Scenes with Vectorized 3D Strokes" by Hao-Bin Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any synthetic or real-world datasets. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using **multi-view datasets of real-world and synthetic images** for evaluation. However, they do not specify the names of these datasets in the abstract or introduction. Therefore, I will need to check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the references, I will look for any papers that describe datasets relevant to multi-view images or 3D scene reconstruction. If the authors have used well-known datasets, such as those from previous works, I will ensure to cite the original papers that introduced these datasets.

For example, if they refer to datasets like the **LLFF dataset** or **Blender dataset**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LLFF dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(4):1â€“14, 2019.

- For the **Blender dataset**, the citation is:
  > Blender Foundation. *Blender: A 3D Creation Suite*. Available at: https://www.blender.org/.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and formatted correctly for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
