To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUTOMATA: Gradient Based Data Subset Selection for Compute-Efficient Hyper-Parameter Tuning" by Krishnateja Killamsetty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically evaluate their method on several real-world datasets across text, vision, and tabular domains. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their experiments in **Section 3.3 (Datasets, Model Architecture, and Experimental Setup)**. Here, they explicitly list the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **SST2 Dataset**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 8,544 training instances, 1,101 validation instances, and 2,210 test instances. The dataset classifies sentences as either negative or positive.

2. **SST5 Dataset**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 8,544 training instances, 1,101 validation instances, and 2,210 test instances. It classifies sentences into five categories: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive.

3. **glue-SST2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and has 63,982 training instances, 872 validation instances, and 3,367 test instances.

4. **TREC6 Dataset**: A question classification dataset with 4,907 training instances, 545 validation instances, and 500 test instances. It categorizes questions into six broad semantic categories.

5. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: A vision dataset containing 60,000 colored images divided into 10 classes, with 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

6. **CIFAR100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 images, with 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

7. **SVHN Dataset**: A dataset of street view house numbers, containing 73,257 training digits and 26,032 testing digits.

8. **CONNECT-4 Dataset**: A tabular dataset from LIBSVM with 67,557 training instances.

9. **DNA Dataset**: A tabular dataset with 1,400 training instances.

10. **SATIMAGE Dataset**: A tabular dataset with 3,104 training instances.

11. **LETTER Dataset**: A tabular dataset with 10,500 training instances.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
