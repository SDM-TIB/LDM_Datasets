To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PEYMA: A Tagged Corpus for Persian Named Entities" by Mahsa Sadat Shahshahani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a standard tagged Persian NER dataset, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe how they constructed the dataset. They mention that they collected documents from ten news websites and created a tagged corpus consisting of 709 documents with a total of 302,530 tokens. This section provides key details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the content.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their named entity recognition system using the dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research. They also mention the inter-annotator agreement and the number of tokens labeled as named entities, which adds to the dataset's credibility.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not explicitly provide a citation for the PEYMA dataset itself, as it is the primary contribution of the authors. However, I can reference the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Mahsa Sadat Shahshahani, Mahdi Mohseni, Azadeh Shakery, Heshaam Faili. *PEYMA: A Tagged Corpus for Persian Named Entities*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Science and Information Technology (CSICC), Tehran, Iran, 2023.

In summary, I have identified the dataset as the PEYMA corpus, described its contents and significance, and retrieved the appropriate citation. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.
