To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Creating Unbiased Public Benchmark Datasets with Data Leakage Prevention for Predictive Process Monitoring" by Hans Weytjens and Jochen De Weerdt, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for unbiased benchmark datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they used. Here, they mention five publicly available datasets from the 4TU.ResearchData repository:

1. **BPIC 2012**: Contains logs of a loan application process at a Dutch bank.
2. **BPIC 2015**: A collection of building permit applications in five Dutch municipalities, concatenated into one dataset.
3. **BPIC 2017**: A richer, cleaner, and larger set of logs of a Dutch bank loan application process.
4. **BPIC 2019**: Concerns a purchase order handling process with shorter cases.
5. **BPIC 2020**: A collection of five smaller datasets related to travel administration at a university.

In this section, the authors also provide a brief description of each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their context and application.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the BPIC datasets are as follows:

- For **BPIC 2012**, the citation is:
  > BPI Challenge 2012. *4TU.ResearchData*. Available at: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2012/12689204

- For **BPIC 2015**, the citation is:
  > BPI Challenge 2015. *4TU.ResearchData*. Available at: https://data.4tu.nl/collections/BPI_Challenge_2015/5065424

- For **BPIC 2017**, the citation is:
  > BPI Challenge 2017. *4TU.ResearchData*. Available at: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2017/12696884

- For **BPIC 2019**, the citation is:
  > BPI Challenge 2019. *4TU.ResearchData*. Available at: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2019/12715853

- For **BPIC 2020**, the citation is:
  > BPI Challenge 2020. *4TU.ResearchData*. Available at: https://data.4tu.nl/collections/BPI_Challenge_2020/5065541

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources, which is essential for reproducibility and verification in research.
