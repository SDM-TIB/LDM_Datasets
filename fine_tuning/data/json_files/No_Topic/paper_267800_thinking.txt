To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hidden Markov Movement Model for rapidly identifying behavioral states from animal tracks" by Kim Whoriskey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and mentions that it was applied to real tracks from multiple species, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any specific references to datasets. The introduction discusses the use of electronic telemetry for documenting animal movement, indicating that the authors likely used specific datasets for their analysis.

I will then focus on the **methods** section, particularly where the authors describe the data analysis and simulation study. Here, they mention three specific animal tracks used for their analysis:

1. **Grey Seal Track**: Collected by a Sea Mammal Research Unit head-mounted Satellite Relay Data Logger in Kouchibouguac National Park, New Brunswick, in 2013.
2. **Lake Trout Track**: An acoustic Vemco Positioning System (VPS) track of an adult male lake trout in northern Lake Huron in 2014.
3. **Blue Shark Track**: A light-based geolocation track recorded by an immature female blue shark tagged near Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 2014.

In the **results** section, the authors confirm that these datasets were used to evaluate the performance of their model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Grey Seal Track**, the citation is:
  > Jonsen, I. D., Mills Flemming, J., & Myers, R. A. (2005). Robust state-space modeling of animal movement data. *Ecology*, 86(11), 2874-2880.

- For the **Lake Trout Track**, the citation is:
  > Riley, S. C., Binder, T. R., Wattrus, N. J., et al. (2014). Lake trout in northern Lake Huron spawn on submerged drumlins. *Journal of Great Lakes Research*, 40(3), 415-420.

- For the **Blue Shark Track**, the citation is:
  > Smith, F. (2013). Understanding HPE in the VEMCO Positioning System (VPS). VEMCO Document #: DOC-005457-01. Available from http://vemco.com/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research.
