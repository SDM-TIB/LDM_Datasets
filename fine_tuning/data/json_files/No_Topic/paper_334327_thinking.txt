To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Multi-label Classification under Temporal Concept Drift: Rethinking Group-Robust Algorithms in a Label-Wise Setting" by Ilias Chalkidis and Anders Søgaard, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, while the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of multi-label document classification and mention various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. The **datasets section** (Section 3) is where I expect to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 3, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **UK-LEX**: This dataset consists of 36,500 documents related to UK legislation, with two different label granularities (18 and 69 topics). The dataset is chronologically split into training, development, and test subsets.

2. **EUR-LEX**: This dataset includes 65,000 documents of EU legislation, annotated with concepts from the EuroVoc thesaurus. It also supports multiple label granularities and is chronologically split into training, development, and test subsets.

3. **BIOASQ**: This dataset contains 100,000 biomedical articles from PubMed, annotated with concepts from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) taxonomy. It is also chronologically split into training, development, and test subsets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For **UK-LEX**:
  > Chalkidis, I., & Søgaard, A. (2021). MultiEURLEX - a multi-lingual and multi-label legal document classification dataset for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **EUR-LEX**:
  > Chalkidis, I., Fergadiotis, M., & Androutsopoulos, I. (2021). MultiEURLEX - a multi-lingual and multi-label legal document classification dataset for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- For **BIOASQ**:
  > Tsatsaronis, G., Balikas, G., Malakasiotis, P., Partalas, I., Zschunke, M., Alvers, M. R., ... & Paliouras, G. (2015). An overview of the bioasq large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering competition. BMC Bioinformatics, 16(1), 138.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
