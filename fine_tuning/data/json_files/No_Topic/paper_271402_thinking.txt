To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On a gap between rational annuitization price for producer and price for customer" by Nikolai Dokuchaev, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the pricing of annuities under uncertainty but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **literature review and references** sections to see if any datasets are referenced indirectly through the studies cited. The references include various studies related to annuities and pricing, but I need to determine if any of these studies provide datasets that can be extracted.

I will also look for any **figures, tables, or examples** that might indicate the use of datasets. The paper includes examples and figures that illustrate the concepts discussed, but I need to check if any of these are based on specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will compile a list of datasets mentioned or implied. If any datasets are identified, I will ensure to find their full citations from the references section or any other relevant sources.

For example, if I find that the paper references mortality tables or specific datasets used in the analysis, I will note them down. If the paper cites a study that provides a dataset, I will include that citation as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will conclude that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology for explicit mentions of datasets.
2. Review the literature review and references for indirect mentions of datasets.
3. Look for figures, tables, or examples that may indicate the use of datasets.
4. Compile a list of identified datasets with full citations.
5. Conclude if no datasets are found.

This structured approach will help ensure that I thoroughly extract any relevant datasets from the paper.
