To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Imitation Made Easy" by Sarah Young et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention the tasks or datasets used, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale data for imitation learning and mention using a new interface for data collection. However, they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **methods section** where they describe their experimental setup.

In **section 3 (Method)**, the authors detail their data collection process using the "Demonstrations with Assistive Tools (DemoAT)" framework. They mention collecting **1000 diverse demonstrations for each of the two tasks**: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile stacking. This indicates that they have created a dataset for each task, but I need to find more specific details about these datasets.

Next, I will look for any specific names or references to existing datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors evaluate their methods on the two tasks they defined earlier. They mention the number of demonstrations collected but do not reference any external datasets.

Since the datasets are created by the authors for their specific tasks, I will document them as follows:

1. **Pushing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 demonstrations collected for the non-prehensile pushing task. The authors describe the diversity of the data collected across various environments and objects.

2. **Stacking Dataset**: This dataset also consists of 1000 demonstrations, but for the prehensile stacking task. Similar to the pushing dataset, it includes diverse demonstrations across different settings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if the authors cite any foundational works or datasets that influenced their work. However, since these datasets are original to the authors' experiments, they may not have formal citations like established datasets.

For the datasets I identified, I will create the following citations based on the information provided in the paper:

- For the **Pushing Dataset**, since it is original to this work, I will cite it as:
  > Young, S., Gandhi, D., Gupta, A., Abbeel, P., & Tulsiani, S. (2023). Visual Imitation Made Easy. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

- For the **Stacking Dataset**, I will use the same citation as it is also original to this work:
  > Young, S., Gandhi, D., Gupta, A., Abbeel, P., & Tulsiani, S. (2023). Visual Imitation Made Easy. In Proceedings of the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
