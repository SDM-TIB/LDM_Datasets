To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fortify Machine Learning Production Systems: Detect and Classify Adversarial Attacks" by Matthew Ciolino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the exploration of the adversarial image classification space, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their previous work and the datasets used for training and testing models. They mention fine-tuning MobileNetV2 on different 50-class datasets, which indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiment section**. Here, the authors state that they applied six different adversarial attacks to five different pre-trained models using the **ImageNetV2 test dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments.

In the **reproducibility section**, the authors refer to a Google Collaboratory link that runs a subset of the dataset used. This suggests that there might be additional datasets or variations of datasets that are relevant.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

- **ImageNetV2**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
  > B. Recht, R. Roelofs, L. Schmidt, and V. Shankar. "Do ImageNet classifiers generalize to ImageNet?" In International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2019, pp. 5389â€“5400.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the ImageNetV2 dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name and its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
