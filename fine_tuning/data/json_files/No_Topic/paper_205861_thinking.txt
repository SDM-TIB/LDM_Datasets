To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Bottom-up Subspace Clustering using FP-Trees for High Dimensional Data" by Minh Tuan Doan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the proposed algorithm using "real-life data, including ten genomic datasets and a car parking occupancy dataset." This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation process. In this section, they specifically mention the use of "ten gene expression datasets" and "a car parking occupancy dataset." I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments subsection on gene expression data**, the authors provide a table (Table IV) summarizing the characteristics of the ten gene expression datasets. I will extract the names and details of these datasets from this table. The datasets listed are:

1. **Adenocarcinoma (ADE)**: 76 patients, 9868 genes, 2 classes.
2. **Brain (BRA)**: 42 patients, 5597 genes, 5 classes.
3. **Breast.2.Class (BR2)**: 78 patients, 4869 genes, 2 classes.
4. **Breast.3.Class (BR3)**: 96 patients, 4869 genes, 3 classes.
5. **Colon (COL)**: 62 patients, 2000 genes, 2 classes.
6. **Leukemia (LEU)**: 38 patients, 3051 genes, 2 classes.
7. **Lymphoma (LYM)**: 62 patients, 4026 genes, 3 classes.
8. **NCI (NCI)**: 61 patients, 5244 genes, 8 classes.
9. **Prostate (PRO)**: 102 patients, 6033 genes, 2 classes.
10. **SRBCT (SRB)**: 63 patients, 2308 genes, 4 classes.

Next, I will look for the **car parking occupancy dataset** mentioned in the paper. The authors describe this dataset in the context of their experiments with real-life data. They mention that it consists of parking events recorded at 276 locations in the City of Melbourne, with data collected at 15-minute intervals over a specific time period.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper. The gene expression datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for their original sources. The car parking dataset is cited as:

- **Parking Events in Melbourne**: 
  > "Parking Events 2014," City of Melbourne, 2018. Available at: https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Parking-Events-2014/mq3i-cbxd.

For the gene expression datasets, I will refer to the original papers or databases where these datasets were published or made available. 

After compiling all this information, I will ensure that I have a clear and concise description of each dataset along with their full citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
