To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactron: Embodied Adaptive Object Detection" by Klemen Kotar and Roozbeh Mottaghi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation or training.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using the **AI2-THOR framework** for their experiments, which suggests that this framework is likely associated with a dataset. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. In this paper, they explicitly mention collecting two datasets: **d(T, Strain)** and **d(T, Stest)**. 

1. **d(T, Strain)**: This dataset consists of training and validation scenes from the AI2-THOR framework, totaling 100 scenes. It includes scene IDs, agent starting positions, and labels for every object visible from those positions. The authors note that they uniformly draw 1,000 pairs of scene IDs and starting positions from the training and validation scenes.

2. **d(T, Stest)**: This dataset is the test set, which consists of 20 scenes from the AI2-THOR framework. Similar to the training dataset, it includes scene IDs and starting positions, with 100 pairs drawn from the test scenes.

Additionally, the authors mention a **pre-training dataset** of 10,000 frames collected from the training scenes with object detection annotations. This dataset is crucial for training the base object detector.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the AI2-THOR framework, which is essential for understanding the datasets used:

- For **AI2-THOR**, the citation is:
  > Eric Kolve, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Winson Han, Eli VanderBilt, Luca Weihs, Alvaro Herrasti, Daniel Gordon, Yuke Zhu, Abhinav Gupta, and Ali Farhadi. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. arXiv, 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: d(T, Strain)
   - Description: Training and validation scenes from the AI2-THOR framework, consisting of 100 scenes with scene IDs, agent starting positions, and object labels.
   - Citation: Eric Kolve et al. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. arXiv, 2017.

2. **Dataset Name**: d(T, Stest)
   - Description: Test scenes from the AI2-THOR framework, consisting of 20 scenes with scene IDs and starting positions.
   - Citation: Eric Kolve et al. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. arXiv, 2017.

3. **Dataset Name**: AI2-THOR Pre-training Dataset
   - Description: A dataset of 10,000 frames collected from training scenes with object detection annotations.
   - Citation: Eric Kolve et al. *AI2-THOR: An Interactive 3D Environment for Visual AI*. arXiv, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
