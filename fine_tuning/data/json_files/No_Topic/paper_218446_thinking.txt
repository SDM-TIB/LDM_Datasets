To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A novel hybrid model based on multi-objective Harris hawks optimization algorithm for daily PM2.5 and PM10 forecasting" by Pei Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves forecasting PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using data from three cities in China, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the significance of air pollution and the need for accurate forecasting models. They mention using air pollutant concentration time series from three cities, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed later.

In the **methodology section**, particularly subsection 3.1 (Study area and data description), the authors explicitly state that they collected daily PM2.5 and PM10 time series data from **Jinan, Nanjing, and Chongqing**. They specify that the data spans from **November 1, 2017, to November 23, 2018**, with a total of **338 observations**. This section provides crucial details about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from specific cities and time periods, they may not have formal citations like published datasets. Instead, I will note the source of the data as the cities mentioned in the paper.

The datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **PM2.5 Dataset**: Daily PM2.5 concentration time series collected from Jinan, Nanjing, and Chongqing from November 1, 2017, to November 23, 2018, totaling 338 observations.

2. **PM10 Dataset**: Daily PM10 concentration time series collected from the same cities and time period as the PM2.5 dataset, also totaling 338 observations.

Since these datasets are not formally published in a separate paper, I will reference them based on the context provided in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, ensuring that the citations and descriptions are clear and accurate for future reference.
