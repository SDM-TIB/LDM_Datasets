To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating bankruptcy prediction models in the presence of extreme class imbalance and multiple stages of economy" by Sheikh Rabiul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a new public dataset called the **Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods section**. Here, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset**. They explain that it contains loan-level credit performance data on fixed-rate mortgages purchased or guaranteed by Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2017. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of bankruptcy prediction models.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the Freddie Mac dataset for their experiments, which further solidifies its importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Freddie Mac dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Freddie Mac. *Single Family Loan-Level Dataset*. Available at: http://www.freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf_loanlevel_dataset.page (Accessed: 2013).

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
