To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EcoFlow: Efficient Convolutional Dataflows for Low-Power Neural Network Accelerators" by Lois Orosa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of EcoFlow on CNN training workloads and GAN training workloads, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (likely section 6) to find specific datasets used for evaluation. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets for training their models. I will note the details provided about these datasets, such as their sizes and the specific tasks they are used for.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
