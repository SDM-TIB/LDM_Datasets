To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A survey of active learning algorithms for supervised remote sensing image classification" by Devis Tuia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will specifically examine **section VI (Datasets and Setup)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe three datasets:

1. **Hyperspectral VHR Dataset**: This dataset consists of a hyperspectral image of the city of Pavia, Italy, taken by the airborne ROSIS-03 optical sensor. It includes 102 spectral bands and a total of 206,009 labeled pixels.

2. **Hyperspectral MR Dataset**: This dataset is an AVIRIS image taken over Indiana's Indian Pines test site, containing 16 classes and a total of 10,366 labeled pixels. It is a classical benchmark for validating model accuracy.

3. **Multispectral VHR Dataset**: This dataset is a QuickBird scene of a suburb of Zurich, Switzerland, with 9 classes and a total of 20,000 pixels extracted for training and candidate sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The citations I will need to extract are:

- For the **Hyperspectral VHR Dataset** (Pavia):
  > Licciardi, G., Paciﬁci, F., Tuia, D., Prasad, S., West, T., Giacco, F., Inglada, J., Christophe, E., Chanussot, J., & Gamba, P. (2009). Decision fusion for the classification of hyperspectral data: Outcome of the 2008 GRS-S data fusion contest. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 47(11), 3857-3865.

- For the **Hyperspectral MR Dataset** (Indian Pines):
  > Jackson, Q., & Landgrebe, D. (2001). An adaptive classifier design for high-dimensional data analysis with a limited training data set. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 39(12), 2664-2679.

- For the **Multispectral VHR Dataset** (QuickBird):
  > Tuia, D., Pasolli, E., & Emery, W. J. (2011). Dataset shift adaptation with active queries. In *URBAN /URS Joint Event*, Munich, Germany.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
