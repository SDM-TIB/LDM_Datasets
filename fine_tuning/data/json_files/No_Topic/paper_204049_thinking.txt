To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pre-Synaptic Pool Modification (PSPM): A Supervised Learning Procedure for Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks" by Bryce Bagley et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically details the experimental setup and any datasets utilized. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments involving Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) networks and Probabilistic Integrate-and-Fire (PIF) models. They mention generating reference spike trains from a PIF model, which suggests that the PIF model's outputs serve as a dataset for their experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in relation to the experiments conducted. The authors discuss various trials and configurations but do not explicitly name external datasets. Instead, they describe the generation of spike trains from their models, which are used as reference data.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets. The paper cites several foundational works in computational neuroscience and spiking neural networks, but it does not provide specific datasets from external sources.

Based on my review, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **PIF Model Outputs**: The authors generated reference spike trains from a probabilistic integrate-and-fire model with 400 neurons. This model's outputs serve as the primary dataset for evaluating the PSPM learning rules.

The citation for the PIF model is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it references foundational works in the field. I will note that the authors refer to their own simulations and methodologies rather than external datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant citations or references that support the datasets mentioned in the paper. If no external datasets are cited, I will indicate that the datasets are derived from the authors' own simulations and methodologies.
