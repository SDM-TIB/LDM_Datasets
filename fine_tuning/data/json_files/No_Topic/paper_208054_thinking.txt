To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks for Choice Analysis: Extracting Complete Economic Information for Interpretation" by Shenhao Wang, Qingyi Wang, and Jinhua Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Setup of Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using a stated preference (SP) survey conducted in Singapore in July 2017. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will extract the details of the dataset mentioned:

1. **Stated Preference Survey Dataset**: The authors conducted a survey with 2,073 respondents, each responding to seven choice scenarios. The final dataset contains 8,418 observations, with the choice variable being travel mode choice, including five alternatives: walking, public transit, ride sharing, using an autonomous vehicle, and driving. The explanatory variables include 25 individual-specific and alternative-specific variables.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is based on a survey conducted by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like published datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is derived from their own research.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Shenhao Wang, Qingyi Wang, and Jinhua Zhao. *Deep Neural Networks for Choice Analysis: Extracting Complete Economic Information for Interpretation*. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Since the dataset is not published separately, I will include the authors' names and the title of the paper as the source of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that the citation is included as required. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset used in the research.
