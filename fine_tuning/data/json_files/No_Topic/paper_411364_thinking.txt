To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grid-Forming Control of Power Converters: Equivalence Proof through Simplified Models" by Aidar Zhetessov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on grid-forming control algorithms, but it does not mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the necessity of grid integration for renewable energy sources and references various studies, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections II (Nodal Equivalence of Grid-Forming Controls) and III (Network Dynamics of Grid-Forming Controls). These sections delve into the theoretical analysis of different control techniques but do not reference any datasets used for empirical validation or experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion** section, which summarizes the findings and suggests future research directions. However, it does not provide any information about datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references primarily consist of papers discussing theoretical aspects of power systems and control techniques, but they do not specify any datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus is on theoretical equivalence and analysis rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have extracted their names, descriptions, and full citations accordingly.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this research paper, and therefore, no dataset entries will be created.
