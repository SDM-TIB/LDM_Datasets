To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker Diarization as a Fully Online Learning Problem in MiniVox" by Baihan Lin and Xinxin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a new benchmark called **MiniVox**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **background** and **proposed online learning solution** sections. The authors discuss existing datasets like **VoxCeleb** and **Speakers in the Wild (SITW)**, which are used to generate the MiniVox dataset. This is important as it shows the foundation upon which MiniVox is built.

In **section 5 (Benchmark Description: MiniVox)**, the authors describe how MiniVox is constructed from single-speaker annotated utterances. This section provides details about the dataset's generation process, confirming that MiniVox is indeed a dataset created for their experiments.

I will also check the **empirical evaluation** section to see how MiniVox is utilized in experiments, which will help clarify its purpose and application.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **MiniVox**: Since this is a new benchmark created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Baihan Lin and Xinxin Zhang. *Speaker Diarization as a Fully Online Learning Problem in MiniVox*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2023.

2. **VoxCeleb**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: A large-scale speaker identification dataset*. In INTERSPEECH, 2017.

3. **Speakers in the Wild (SITW)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mitchell McLaren, Luciana Ferrer, Diego Castan, and Aaron Lawson. *The speakers in the wild (sitw) speaker recognition database*. In INTERSPEECH, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
