To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Source Scale Bias via Image Warping for Domain Adaptation" by Shen Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Methodology and Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of images, resolution, and categories.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **BDD100K**: This dataset features 100,000 images with a resolution of 1280x720 for object detection and segmentation, covering various weather conditions and times of day. It includes 10 categories for annotation.

2. **Cityscapes**: This dataset provides 5,000 images of urban road scenes at a resolution of 2048x1024 for semantic segmentation, with 19 categories.

3. **DENSE**: This dataset contains 12,997 images at a resolution of 1920x1024, capturing diverse weather conditions such as heavy fog and heavy snow.

4. **ACDC**: Designed for adverse conditions (fog and snow), this dataset includes 1,600 images at 2048x1024 for segmentation across 19 categories.

5. **DarkZurich**: This dataset is tailored for low-light conditions, offering 2,416 unlabeled nighttime images and 151 labeled twilight images for segmentation, with a resolution of 1920x1080, focusing on urban settings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will compile are:

- For **BDD100K**:
  > Fisher Yu, Haofeng Chen, Xin Wang, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Dataset for Heterogeneous Multitask Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

- For **Cityscapes**:

- For **DENSE**:
  > Mario Bijelic, Tobias Gruber, Fahim Mannan, Florian Kraus, Werner Ritter, Klaus Dietmayer, and Felix Heide. *Seeing Through Fog Without Seeing Fog: Deep Multimodal Sensor Fusion in Unseen Adverse Weather*. In CVPR, 2020.

- For **ACDC**:
  > Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, and Luc Van Gool. *ACDC: The Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences for Semantic Driving Scene Understanding*. In ICCV, 2021.

- For **DarkZurich**:
  > Christos Sakaridis, Dengxin Dai, and Luc Van Gool. *Map-Guided Curriculum Domain Adaptation and Uncertainty-Aware Evaluation for Semantic Nighttime Image Segmentation*. TPAMI, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
