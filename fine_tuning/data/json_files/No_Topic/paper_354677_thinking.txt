To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extension of a Linear Controller Scheme to Non-Linear Systems and its Application on Inverted Pendulum" by Justin Jacob and Navin Khaneja, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the control and stabilization of a rotary inverted pendulum, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** closely, as this is where datasets are often described. In this section, the authors mention the use of the **Quanser rotary inverted pendulum** as the experimental setup. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference to a dataset in this section.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references include various papers and resources, but they primarily focus on control strategies and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or analysis, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors refer to the **Quanser rotary inverted pendulum** as a system used for their experiments, which may imply that data related to this system could be available through the manufacturer or related research.

In summary, I will document that no specific datasets were identified in the paper, but I will mention the **Quanser rotary inverted pendulum** as the experimental setup used, which could be a source of data for future reference.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format for clarity.
