To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Debiased Spatial Whittle Likelihood" by Arthur P. Guillaumin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are cited or described in detail.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, as this is where the authors typically outline their experimental setup, including any datasets used for simulations or real-world applications. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional information about the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other methods. This section may also contain references to datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using the **GEBCO Bathymetric Compilation Group dataset**, I would look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> GEBCO Bathymetric Compilation Group (2019). The GEBCO 2019 gridâ€”A continuous terrain model of the global oceans and land. Technical report, British Oceanographic Data Centre, National Oceanography Centre, NERC.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
