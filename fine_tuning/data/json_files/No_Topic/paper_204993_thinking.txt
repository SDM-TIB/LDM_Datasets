To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Load Sampling for Worst-Case Structural Analysis Under Force Location Uncertainty" by Yining Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the computational challenges in structural analysis under force location uncertainty but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors evaluate their algorithm on three test structures: **FERTILITY**, **ROCKINGCHAIR**, and **SHARK**. These structures are likely the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, or any relevant statistics. The paper includes a **Table 1** that provides statistics for these test structures, including the number of nodes and maximum stress values, which confirms that these structures are indeed the datasets being referenced.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that might provide additional context. However, since the datasets are specific test structures created for the experiments, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

The relevant details I have gathered about the datasets are as follows:

1. **FERTILITY**: A test structure with 11,221 nodes, 4,494 surfaces, and a maximum stress of 6.37 MPa.
2. **ROCKINGCHAIR**: A test structure with 15,191 nodes, 5,918 surfaces, and a maximum stress of 37.0 MPa.
3. **SHARK**: A test structure with 14,152 nodes, 5,757 surfaces, and a maximum stress of 26.2 MPa.

Since these datasets are not publicly available datasets but rather specific models used in the authors' experiments, I will note that they are proprietary or created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the primary source for these datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:

DETC2018-85310.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries based on the information collected, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes the necessary details.
