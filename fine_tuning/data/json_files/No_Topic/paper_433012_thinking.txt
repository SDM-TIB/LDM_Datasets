To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Asymmetric Volatility Connectedness" by Abdulnasser Hatemi-J, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of volatility spillover and mentions an application involving the three largest financial markets, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these markets.

Next, I will examine the **application section** (Section 3) where the author describes the empirical application of the methodology. Here, the author states that the data source is the **FRED database**, which is provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. This indicates that the dataset used for the analysis is likely from this database.

I will also look for any specific datasets or variables mentioned in the context of the three financial markets (US, Euro area, and China). The author notes that the sample covers data from **January 1999 until December 2023**, which is crucial for understanding the temporal scope of the dataset.

In the **conclusion** and **references sections**, I will check for any additional datasets or sources that might be cited. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one from the FRED database.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the dataset:

1. **FRED Database**: This dataset includes various economic indicators and financial data for the US, Euro area, and China, covering the period from January 1999 to December 2023. The author uses this data to analyze volatility spillover effects.

Next, I will retrieve the full citation for the FRED database:

- For the **FRED database**, the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. *FRED: Federal Reserve Economic Data*. Available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing. This will allow for a clear understanding of the dataset used in the research paper and its relevance to the study's findings.
