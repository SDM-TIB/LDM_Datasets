To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLOUD-NET: AN END-TO-END CLOUD DETECTION ALGORITHM FOR LANDSAT 8 IMAGERY" by Sorour Mohajerani and Parvaneh Saeedi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art over a benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. The introduction discusses the importance of cloud detection in satellite imagery but does not specify any datasets yet.

In the **experimental setting section (3.0.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the dataset they utilized for training and testing their method. They refer to a modified dataset introduced in a previous paper, which they call the **38-Cloud dataset**. This dataset consists of 18 Landsat 8 images for training and 20 for testing, with details about the modifications made to improve the ground truths.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the 38-Cloud dataset is indeed the one used for evaluation, which it is, as they report performance metrics based on this dataset.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the original dataset mentioned (the one introduced in [13]). The relevant citation is:

- For the **38-Cloud dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sorour Mohajerani, T. A. Krammer, and P. Saeedi. *A cloud detection algorithm for remote sensing images using fully convolutional neural networks*. In IEEE Int. Workshop on Multimedia Sign. Proc. (MMSP), 2018, pp. 1â€“5.

Since the authors modified the dataset from the original paper, I will ensure to cite the original source as well.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset extracted is the **38-Cloud dataset**, and I will note its modifications and the original source for clarity.
