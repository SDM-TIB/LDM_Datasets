To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Job Title Representation from Job Description Aggregation Network" by Napat Laosaengpha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 3), where the authors describe their evaluation process. Here, they mention using two specific datasets:

1. **JTG-Jobposting Dataset**: This dataset consists of 28,844 job postings sourced from a recruitment website in Thailand. It includes job titles, job descriptions, and skills. The authors provide a detailed description of this dataset, including its structure and statistics.

2. **MyCareersFuture.sg Dataset**: This dataset contains real-world job postings collected by the Singaporean government. It is used as the training set for out-of-domain evaluation. The authors mention that this dataset consists of 30,926 unique job titles and 2,675 standardized ESCO occupation labels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **JTG-Jobposting Dataset**, since it is a private dataset created by the authors, it does not have a formal citation but is described in detail in the paper itself.

- For the **MyCareersFuture.sg Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Akshay Bhola, Kishaloy Halder, Animesh Prasad, and Min-Yen Kan. *Retrieving skills from job descriptions: A language model based extreme multi-label classification framework*. In International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **JTG-Jobposting Dataset**: A private dataset consisting of 28,844 job postings from a Thai recruitment website, including job titles, descriptions, and skills. (No formal citation available).

2. **MyCareersFuture.sg Dataset**: A dataset of real-world job postings collected by the Singaporean government, consisting of 30,926 unique job titles and 2,675 standardized ESCO occupation labels.
   > Akshay Bhola, Kishaloy Halder, Animesh Prasad, and Min-Yen Kan. *Retrieving skills from job descriptions: A language model based extreme multi-label classification framework*. In International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
