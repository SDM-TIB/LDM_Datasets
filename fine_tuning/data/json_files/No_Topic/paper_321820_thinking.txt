To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Design and Control Problems Involving Neural Network Surrogates" by Dominic Yang, Prasanna Balaprakash, and Sven Leyffer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Data," or "Methodology."** In this paper, the authors discuss three applications involving neural networks, which may indicate the use of datasets for training and testing.

In the **section discussing the optimal design of combustion engines**, the authors mention that the DNN was trained using **64 trips**, each split into **1,500 observations**. This suggests a dataset related to automobile engine specifications and emissions, but I need to find more details.

I will also check the **references section** to find citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will need to ensure I capture the full citation for each.

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Automobile Engine Dataset**: This dataset consists of data from **64 trips**, with each trip containing **1,500 observations**. It includes parameters such as fuel injection, engine RPM, and compression ratio, which are crucial for training the DNN.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using the MNIST dataset for adversarial attack generation. This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is widely used in machine learning for classification tasks.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Automobile Engine Dataset**, since it is derived from the authors' own experiments, I will note it as:
  > Yang, D., Balaprakash, P., & Leyffer, S. (2021). *Modeling Design and Control Problems Involving Neural Network Surrogates*. [Dataset description based on experiments].

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Finally, I will ensure that I format these findings clearly, ready for any structured output or further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
