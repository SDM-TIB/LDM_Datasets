To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Capacity Allocation in Flow-Based Market Coupling" by Richard Weinhold and Robert Mieth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments on the **IEEE 118 bus test system**, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their numerical experiments using the **IEEE 118 bus test system** and also mention augmenting this dataset with additional generation technologies and scenarios for renewable energy sources. This suggests that there are variations of the dataset based on different scenarios (e.g., original, medium res, high res).

I will also check the **case study section** where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specify that the numerical experiments utilize the IEEE 118 bus test system as published in a specific reference, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEEE 118 bus test system. The relevant citation is:
> I. Pena, C. B. Martinez-Anido, and B.-M. Hodge. *An extended IEEE 118-bus test system with high renewable penetration*. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 33, no. 1, pp. 281â€“289, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries. The primary dataset identified is the **IEEE 118 bus test system**, and I will ensure to include its variations (original, medium res, high res) in the documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
