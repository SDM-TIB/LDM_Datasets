To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case for Noisy Shallow Gate-Based Circuits in Quantum Machine Learning" by Patrick Selig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using several standard machine learning datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (Section 3.5) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention a total of seven datasets, providing key details about each one, such as the number of features, classes, and sizes for training and testing.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Iris Dataset**: 
   - Features: 4
   - Classes: 3
   - Train Size: 60
   - Test Size: 90

2. **Wine Dataset**: 
   - Features: 13
   - Classes: 3
   - Train Size: 70
   - Test Size: 90

3. **Ecoli Dataset**: 
   - Features: 7
   - Classes: 8
   - Train Size: 70
   - Test Size: 70

4. **Vertebral Column 1 Dataset**: 
   - Features: 6
   - Classes: 2
   - Train Size: 70
   - Test Size: 108

5. **Vertebral Column 2 Dataset**: 
   - Features: 6
   - Classes: 3
   - Train Size: 70
   - Test Size: 240

6. **Glass Identification Dataset**: 
   - Features: 9
   - Classes: 7
   - Train Size: 70
   - Test Size: 144

7. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**: 
   - Features: 32
   - Classes: 2
   - Train Size: 120
   - Test Size: 449

After identifying these datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
