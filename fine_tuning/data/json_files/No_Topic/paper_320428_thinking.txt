To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frustum Fusion: Pseudo-LiDAR and LiDAR Fusion for 3D Detection" by Farzin Negahbani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework on the **KITTI 3D object detection dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **evaluation setup** sections. In the **evaluation setup** section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their approach on the "3D Object Detection Evaluation 2017" benchmark of the **KITTI dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of training and testing data points and the classes of objects included.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **KITTI dataset** from the **references section**. The citation is as follows:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the KITTI dataset for evaluation, I will document this dataset as the main dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.
