To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Optimal Bandwidth Selection for RBF Kernel using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space Operators for Kernel Based Classifiers" by Bharath Bhushan Damodaran, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on **hyperspectral datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Results)**, where the author explicitly describes the datasets used for evaluation. The paper mentions two datasets:

1. **Pavia University Dataset**: This dataset was collected over the University of Pavia, Italy, using the ROSIS airborne hyperspectral sensor. It consists of 340 pixels with nine classes of interest and includes training and testing samples.

2. **City of Pavia Dataset**: Similar to the Pavia University dataset, this dataset was also collected over the City of Pavia, Italy, using the same sensor. It contains 1096 × 715 pixels with nine classes of interest and comes with training and testing samples.

In the **experimental design section**, the author provides additional details about the datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of hyperspectral imaging. Therefore, I will provide the citations for the original sources of these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For the **Pavia University Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Camps-Valls and L. Bruzzone. "Kernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification." *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, vol. 43, no. 6, pp. 1351–1362, 2005.

- For the **City of Pavia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Camps-Valls and L. Bruzzone. "Kernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification." *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, vol. 43, no. 6, pp. 1351–1362, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
