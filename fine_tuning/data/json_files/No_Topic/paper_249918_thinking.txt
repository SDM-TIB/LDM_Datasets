To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Refinement Network Incorporating Structural Connectivity Prior for Brain Midline Delineation" by Shen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **CQ dataset** and an **in-house dataset**, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors provide a description of the **CQ dataset**, stating that it is a subset of the CQ500 dataset, consisting of 63 midline shift subjects and an equal number of healthy subjects. They also mention that 59% of the subjects have a significant midline shift (≥ 5mm) and provide the mean midline shift value.

The **in-house dataset** is described as consisting of 203 CT series with varying degrees of midline shift caused by cerebral hemorrhage, with 78% of the subjects having a significant midline shift (≥ 5mm). The authors also mention that for both datasets, a total of 10 CT slices per subject were manually delineated by doctors for the midline golden standard.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CQ dataset is a subset of the CQ500 dataset, so I will need to find the citation for the CQ500 dataset. The in-house dataset does not have a specific citation since it is created by the authors.

The citation for the CQ500 dataset is:
> Qure.ai. *CQ500 Dataset*. Available at: http://headctstudy.qure.ai/dataset.

Since the in-house dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is an internal dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CQ Dataset**: A subset of the CQ500 dataset, consisting of 63 midline shift subjects and 63 healthy subjects, with a mean midline shift of 7.59 ± 5.16mm.
   - Citation: Qure.ai. *CQ500 Dataset*. Available at: http://headctstudy.qure.ai/dataset.

2. **In-house Dataset**: Comprising 203 CT series with varying degrees of midline shift due to cerebral hemorrhage, with 78% of subjects having a significant midline shift (≥ 5mm). This dataset is created by the authors and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
