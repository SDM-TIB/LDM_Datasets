To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effects of Images with Different Levels of Familiarity on EEG" by Ali Saeedi and Ehsan Arbabi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the authors discuss the effects of images with varying familiarity levels on EEG signals, which suggests that they likely used specific image datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the images used in their experiments. The authors mention using three categories of images: "unfamiliar," "familiar," and "very familiar." They specify that they used eight images for each category, totaling 24 images. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or reference for these images, which is crucial for proper citation.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details or references to datasets that might have been overlooked. The results primarily focus on the classification rates and the performance of the features extracted from the EEG data, but they do not introduce any new datasets.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or references, I will need to look for any references in the **References section** that might relate to the datasets used. The authors mention that some images were sourced from the internet and others were prepared by the authors themselves. However, they do not cite a specific dataset or image bank for the images used in their study.

Given this analysis, it appears that the authors did not utilize a formal dataset with a citation for the images used in their experiments. Instead, they created their own set of images based on familiarity levels. Therefore, I will note that while the study involved images categorized by familiarity, there are no formal datasets with citations provided in the paper.

In summary, I will compile my findings as follows:

1. **Images Used**: 
   - **Categories**: Unfamiliar, Familiar, Very Familiar
   - **Total Images**: 24 (8 images per category)
   - **Source**: Images were sourced from the internet and created by the authors, but no formal dataset citation is provided.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations, I will conclude that the paper does not reference any specific datasets for the images used in the study. This will be documented in my final output.
