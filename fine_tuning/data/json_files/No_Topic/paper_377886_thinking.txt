To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-End Framework For Universal Lesion Detection With Missing Annotations" by Xiaoyu Bai and Yong Xia, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **DeepLesion dataset**, which is a significant clue that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they specifically mention the **DeepLesion dataset** as the primary dataset for their experiments. They describe it as the largest CT dataset for universal lesion detection, noting that it contains roughly 50% unlabeled lesions. This indicates that the dataset is crucial for their methodology and results.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DeepLesion dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **DeepLesion Dataset**: 
  > Yan, K., Wang, X., Lu, L., & Summers, R. M. (2018). Deeplesion: Automated mining of large-scale lesion annotations and universal lesion detection with deep learning. *Journal of Medical Imaging*, 5(3), 036501.

Since the paper primarily discusses the DeepLesion dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
