To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean-field equilibrium price formation with exponential utility" by Masaaki Fujii and Masashi Sekine, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for analysis. In this case, the abstract discusses equilibrium price formation and mentions the use of mean-field game theory, but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the theoretical framework and the context of the research but does not provide specific dataset names. 

I will then look into the **methodology or experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors describe any datasets used in their analysis. This section typically contains detailed information about the data collection process, the datasets utilized, and their characteristics. However, in this paper, the focus is primarily on theoretical modeling rather than empirical analysis, and no specific datasets are mentioned.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. If the authors refer to previous studies that utilized specific datasets, I will note those references.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. However, if there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document them with full citations, following the format used in the references section of the paper.

In summary, my approach involves:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for explicit mentions of datasets.
2. Checking the references for any indirect mentions of datasets used in prior studies.
3. Documenting any identified datasets with full citations.

Since no datasets were found in this paper, I will not create any dataset entries.
