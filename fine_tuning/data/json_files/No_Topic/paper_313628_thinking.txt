To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the inductive biases of deep domain adaptation" by Rodrigue Siry et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of domain adaptation and mention the use of various benchmarks. I will look for specific names of datasets that are referenced.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **MNIST-M**: A modified version of MNIST that includes color variations.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains images of house numbers.
4. **Office-31**: A dataset used for domain adaptation tasks, consisting of images from 31 categories across three domains (Amazon, Webcam, and DSLR).

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their usage.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations I will look for include:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For **SVHN**:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. "Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning." 2011.

- For **Office-31**:
  > B. Gong, Y. Shi, F. Sha, and K. Grauman. "Geodesic flow kernel for unsupervised domain adaptation." In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2066–2073, 2012.

- For **MNIST-M**:
  > This dataset is often referenced in conjunction with MNIST, but I will ensure to find a specific citation if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
