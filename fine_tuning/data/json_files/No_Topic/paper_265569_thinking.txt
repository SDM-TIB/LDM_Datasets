To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Operational Risk Models and Asymptotic Normality for Small Sample-Sizes" by Paul Larsen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on operational risk models and mentions the use of loss data from the ORX Association OpVaR stability study, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Conclusions)** and **section 3 (Asymptotic normality for OpVaR severity distributions)**, where the author discusses the datasets used for analysis. In the introduction, the author mentions that they use loss data from the ORX Association OpVaR stability study, specifically noting that they analyze four units of measure (UOMs) but only present detailed results for one (UOM1).

In the methodology section, the author describes the loss data sets used for the analysis, which consist of anonymized loss data from member banks. The paper indicates that four UOMs were selected for analysis, but only UOM1 is detailed in the main text, with the others referenced in an appendix.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the ORX Association, which is crucial for the dataset citation. The specific citation for the ORX dataset is not provided in the text, so I will note that the dataset is derived from the ORX Association OpVaR stability study.

The citation for the ORX dataset is:
> ORX Association. *Operational Riskdata eXchange Association (ORX) OpVaR Stability Study*. Available at: [https://www.orx.org](https://www.orx.org).

Additionally, I will note that the author refers to other datasets and methodologies throughout the paper, but the primary dataset used for the analysis is the anonymized loss data from the ORX study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ORX dataset as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper. This will ensure that the extraction is complete and accurate for any further processing or review.
