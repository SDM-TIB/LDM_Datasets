To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Collaborative Sensing for Energy Breakdown" by Yiling Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on the largest public energy dataset collected in Austin, Texas, from 2013 to 2017. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of a dataset called **Dataport**. They state that it is the largest public residential home energy dataset, which contains appliance-level and household aggregate energy consumption sampled every minute from 2012 to 2018. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments** section, the authors provide details about how they filtered the Dataport dataset to focus on data collected from Austin, which contains 534 homes. They also mention that they filtered out appliances with poor data quality, resulting in four different datasets for each year between 2014 to 2017, containing varying numbers of homes and appliances.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **Dataport dataset** mentioned in the paper. The citation is provided in the references section as follows:
> Oliver Parson, Grant Fisher, April Hersey, Nipun Batra, Jack Kelly, Amarjeet Singh, William Knottenbelt, and Alex Rogers. *Dataport and NILMTK: A building data set designed for non-intrusive load monitoring*. In GlobalSIP 2015. IEEE.

Additionally, I will note that the authors used data from the years 2014 to 2017, which they filtered to create four distinct datasets based on the number of homes and appliances.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataport Dataset**: The largest public residential home energy dataset, containing appliance-level and household aggregate energy consumption sampled every minute from 2012 to 2018. The authors specifically used data from Austin, Texas, focusing on 534 homes and filtering out appliances with poor data quality.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.
