To extract datasets from the research paper titled "POSEidon: Face-from-Depth for Driver Pose Estimation" by Guido Borghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on two public datasets and a new dataset called Pandora, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Biwi Kinect Head Pose Dataset**: This dataset is acquired using the Microsoft Kinect sensor and contains approximately 15,000 frames with RGB and depth maps. The authors note that it includes ground truth for yaw, pitch, and roll angles, as well as head center positions. The original paper introducing this dataset is cited as:
   > G. Fanelli, J. Gall, and L. Van Gool. *Real time head pose estimation with random regression forests*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 617–624, 2011.

2. **ICT-3DHP Dataset**: This dataset was introduced by Baltrusaitis et al. in 2012 and also uses the Microsoft Kinect sensor. It contains around 14,000 frames and provides RGB images and depth maps. The citation for this dataset is:
   > T. Baltruˇsaitis, P. Robinson, and L.-P. Morency. *3D constrained local model for rigid and non-rigid facial tracking*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2610–2617, 2012.

3. **Pandora Dataset**: This is a new dataset created by the authors specifically for their study, containing high-resolution depth data with head and shoulder pose annotations. The authors provide a detailed description of its features and state that it is publicly available. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Guido Borghi, Marco Venturelli, Roberto Vezzani, and Rita Cucchiara. *Pandora: A new dataset for driver pose estimation*. Available at: http://imagelab.ing.unimore.it/pandora/.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
