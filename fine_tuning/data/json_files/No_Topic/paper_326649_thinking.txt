To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-resolution Ecosystem Mapping in Repetitive Environments Using Dual Camera SLAM" by Brian M. Hopkinson and Suchendra M. Bhandarkar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a dual-camera SLAM approach for mapping ecosystems, which suggests that datasets related to these environments may be included.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that data was collected in two visually repetitive environments: a lawn on the University campus and a salt marsh on Sapelo Island, GA, USA. This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these locations.

In the **data collection subsection**, the authors detail the equipment used, including a StereoLabs ZED-mini and a Panasonic GH5s camera, and describe the methodology for capturing images. They also mention the use of AprilTag markers for ground control points, which implies that the dataset includes both the images captured and the associated ground truth data from the AprilTags.

Now, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **results and comparison sections**. The authors compare their dual-camera SLAM approach with two state-of-the-art SfM platforms, indicating that they processed six datasets (four from salt marshes and two from the campus lawn). This confirms that there are distinct datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies mentioned. The authors reference several works related to SfM and SLAM techniques, but I need to ensure that I capture the specific datasets they utilized.

The datasets I will extract are:

1. **Dataset from the University campus lawn**: This dataset includes images captured using the dual-camera system in a lawn environment.
2. **Dataset from Sapelo Island salt marsh**: This dataset includes images captured in a salt marsh environment, along with ground control points from AprilTags.

For the full citations, I will note that the authors do not provide specific dataset citations in the references, but I can reference the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper as the source of the datasets:

- For the **University campus lawn dataset**, I will cite:
  > Hopkinson, B. M., & Bhandarkar, S. M. (2023). High-resolution Ecosystem Mapping in Repetitive Environments Using Dual Camera SLAM. *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*.

- For the **Sapelo Island salt marsh dataset**, I will cite the same paper:
  > Hopkinson, B. M., & Bhandarkar, S. M. (2023). High-resolution Ecosystem Mapping in Repetitive Environments Using Dual Camera SLAM. *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
