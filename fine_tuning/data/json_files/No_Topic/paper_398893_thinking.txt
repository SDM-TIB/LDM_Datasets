To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Skin Tone: A Multidimensional Measure of Apparent Skin Color" by William Thong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of a multidimensional skin color scale and mentions the use of datasets for fairness assessments, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **CelebAMask-HQ**: This dataset is described as containing 30,000 images and is used for extracting skin color scores. The authors note that it is available under a non-commercial research agreement.

2. **FFHQ-Ageing**: This dataset consists of 70,000 images and is mentioned as being available under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. It is used in conjunction with CelebAMask-HQ for assessing skin color biases.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For **CelebAMask-HQ**, the citation is:
> Cheng-Han Lee, Ziwei Liu, Lingyun Wu, and Ping Luo. *Maskgan: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

For **FFHQ-Ageing**, the citation is:
> Roy Or-El, Soumyadip Sengupta, Ohad Fried, Eli Shechtman, and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman. *Lifespan age transformation synthesis*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper citations for each.
