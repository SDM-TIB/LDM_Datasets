To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cellular insights into parasitoid interactions: from the encapsulation process in a partially resistant host" by Samuel Gornard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Materials & Methods** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that mention specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

I will also check the **results** section for any additional mentions of datasets, particularly if the authors present data or findings that rely on specific datasets. This can help confirm the datasets identified earlier and provide further details about their use.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References** section to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as volume, pages, and year of publication.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the following:

1. **Sesamia nonagrioides** larvae and their interactions with **Cotesia typhae**.
2. Any experimental datasets related to hemocyte counts, encapsulation processes, or other immune responses.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
