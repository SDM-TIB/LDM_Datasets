To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FMA-ETA: Estimating Travel Time Entirely Based on FFN With Attention" by Yiwen Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a real-world vehicle travel dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for evaluation. They describe a large-scale real-world floating-car trajectory dataset collected in Beijing in 2018. This section provides key details about the dataset, including its size and the filtering criteria applied to the data.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Beijing 2018 Dataset**: This dataset contains trajectory data of hundreds of millions of taxi drivers in Beijing, collected over more than four months. It includes various types of roads and has undergone desensitization to protect privacy. The authors filtered out abnormal data based on specific criteria.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is a proprietary collection from a ride-hailing platform and not a published dataset with a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is referenced as being from a famous ride-sharing platform without a specific citation.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:
1. **Dataset Name**: Beijing 2018 Dataset
   - **Description**: A large-scale real-world floating-car trajectory dataset containing trajectory data of hundreds of millions of taxi drivers in Beijing, collected over more than four months in 2018. The dataset covers various road types and has been filtered for abnormal data.
   - **Citation**: Not available (dataset from a ride-hailing platform).

After gathering this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
