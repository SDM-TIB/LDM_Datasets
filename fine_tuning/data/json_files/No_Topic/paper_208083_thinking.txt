To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PointRCNN: 3D Object Proposal Generation and Detection from Point Cloud" by Shaoshuai Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **KITTI dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **3D detection benchmark of the KITTI dataset**. This confirms that the KITTI dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation for the KITTI dataset is as follows:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the KITTI dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the KITTI dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
