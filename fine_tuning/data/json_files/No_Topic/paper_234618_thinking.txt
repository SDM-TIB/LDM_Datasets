To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiased evaluation of ranking metrics reveals consistent performance in science and technology citation data" by Shuqi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions assessing 17 network-based metrics using three large citation datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their analysis. Here, they mention three specific citation datasets:

1. **American Physical Society citation data (APS)**: This dataset spans from 1893 to 2016 and contains 595,287 nodes (papers) and 7,051,801 directed links (citations). The authors also mention that they used multiple selections of milestone papers chosen by APS journal editors.

2. **High-Energy Physics citation network (HEP)**: This dataset covers years 1764 to 2017, with 829,708 nodes and 14,994,123 directed links. The authors used a list of milestone papers from a community-curated chronology.

3. **US patent citation network (PAT)**: This dataset spans from 1926 to 2010, containing 6,237,625 nodes and 45,962,301 links. The authors reference a list of significant patents identified by Strumsky and Lobo (2015).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **American Physical Society citation data (APS)**, the citation is:
  > American Physical Society. *APS citation data*. Available on demand from https://journals.aps.org/datasets.

- For the **High-Energy Physics citation network (HEP)**, the citation is:
  > INSPIRE. *INSPIRE citation data*. Available on demand from https://inspirehep.net/dumps/inspire-dump.html.

- For the **US patent citation network (PAT)**, the citation is:
  > Kogan, L., Papanikolaou, D., Seru, A., & Stoffman, N. (2017). *Technological innovation, resource allocation, and growth*. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 132(2), 665-712.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
