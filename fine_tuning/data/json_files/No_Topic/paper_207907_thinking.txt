To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SqueezeFit: Label-aware dimensionality reduction by semidefinite programming" by Culver McWhirter, Dustin G. Mixon, and Soledad Villar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks that the authors might have used to validate their method. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, dimensions, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Indian Pines hyperspectral dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes. Available at: ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.

Similarly, if the paper discusses the "MNIST dataset," I will find its citation:
> Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, C. J. Burges. MNIST handwritten digit database. Available at: yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify specific datasets and their details in the experiments section.
3. Locate full citations for each dataset in the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information for clarity and accessibility.
