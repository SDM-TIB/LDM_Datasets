To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formant Tracking using Quasi-Closed Phase Forward-Backward Linear Prediction Analysis and Deep Neural Networks" by Dhananjaya Gowda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the study. In this paper, the authors mention using the **VTR-TIMIT database** for training their models. This is a crucial dataset for the experiments, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the VTR-TIMIT database. The citation is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The relevant citation from the references section is:

- For the **VTR-TIMIT database**, the citation is:
  > L. Deng, X. Cui, R. Pruvenok, J. Huang, and S. Momen. "A database of vocal tract resonance trajectories for research in speech processing." In Proc. Int. Conf. Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Toulouse, France, 2006, pp. I369â€“I372.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics as described in the paper. The VTR-TIMIT database consists of 300 utterances produced by various speakers, which is crucial for the training of the deep neural network models discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or use.
