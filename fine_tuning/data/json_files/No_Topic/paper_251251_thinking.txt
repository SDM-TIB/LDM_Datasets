To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time CNN-based Segmentation Architecture for Ball Detection in a Single View Setup" by Gabriel Van Zandycke and Christophe De Vleeschouwer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a novel approach and mention the release of a dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of ball detection in sports and mention the creation of a new dataset specifically for basketball scenes. This is a strong indication that the dataset is significant for their research.

In **section 3 (Validation Methodology)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe it as consisting of **280 basketball scenes** captured in **30 different arenas**. The dataset includes pairs of consecutive images with manual annotations of the ball in the form of binary segmentation masks. This section confirms the dataset's purpose and characteristics.

I will also check the **acknowledgments and references sections** to find any additional information about the dataset or its citation. The acknowledgment mentions that the dataset was acquired using the Keemotion automated sports production system, which may be relevant for citation.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset based on the information provided in the paper. The dataset is unique in terms of the number of different arenas considered and is publicly available.

The citation for the dataset is:

In 2nd International Workshop on Multimedia Content Analysis in Sports (MMSports â€™19), October 25, 2019, Nice, France. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 8 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3347318.3355517

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details and the citation in a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant information for future reference or processing.
