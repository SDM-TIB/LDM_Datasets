To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Influence-based Approach for Root Cause Alarm Discovery in Telecom Networks" by Keli Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on both **artificial data** and **real-world telecom data**, indicating that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using **synthetic data** generated through a specific process and a **real-world dataset** collected from a major cellular carrier in a city in China. This section provides crucial details about the datasets used for evaluation.

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe the synthetic dataset generation process, which involves creating event sequences based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and simulating events using a multi-dimensional Hawkes process. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this synthetic dataset since it is generated by the authors.

2. **Real-world Dataset**: The real-world dataset is explicitly mentioned as containing **672,639 alarm records from 3,818 devices with 78 different alarm types**. The authors specify that this dataset was collected between **August 4th, 2018, and October 24th, 2018**. They also note that the dataset is available at a GitHub repository, which is a key detail for citation purposes.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the synthetic dataset is generated and not published elsewhere, it will not have a citation. For the real-world dataset, I will note the GitHub repository link provided in the paper.

The citation for the real-world dataset is:
> Keli Zhang, Marcus Kalander, Min Zhou, Xi Zhang, and Junjian Ye. *Root Cause Alarm Discovery in Telecom Networks*. Available at: https://github.com/shaido987/alarm-rca.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the paper and their relevant details. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
