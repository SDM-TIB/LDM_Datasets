To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrated Neural Network and Machine Vision Approach For Leather Defect Classification" by Sze-Teng Liong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Database)**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset contains **2378 images of leather patches**, with specific details about the number of images containing defects and those that do not. This section is crucial as it provides the primary dataset information.

In this section, the authors specify that:
- The dataset consists of **2378 images** of leather patches, with **475 images** containing at least one tick bite defect and **1903 images** without defects. 
- The images were captured using a robot arm with a Canon camera, ensuring consistent quality and resolution.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for comparison or validation.

After gathering the dataset information, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. However, in this case, the dataset appears to be original to the authors' work, so I will document it accordingly.

The full citation for the dataset will include:
- The title of the dataset: "Leather Defect Dataset"
- A description of the dataset: "A dataset containing 2378 images of leather patches, with 475 images containing tick bite defects and 1903 images without defects."
- The authors of the paper: Sze-Teng Liong, Y.S. Gan, Yen-Chang Huang, Kun-Hong Liu, Wei-Chuen Yau.
- The publication details: "In Proceedings of the [Conference/Journal Name], [Year]."

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details and ensure that the citation is formatted correctly for future reference.
