To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Face Morphable Models 'In-the-Wild'" by James Booth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the creation of a new "in-the-wild" 3D Morphable Model and hints at the existence of a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the challenges of 3D facial shape estimation in unconstrained conditions. This section may provide context for the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then focus on **section 4 (KF-ITW Dataset)**, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the dataset. Here, the authors detail the KF-ITW dataset, which consists of 3D facial scans of 17 subjects captured under various conditions. They mention the use of KinectFusion to acquire these scans, which serves as the ground truth for their evaluations.

The description of the KF-ITW dataset includes important details such as:
- The number of subjects (17)
- The types of expressions recorded (neutral, happy, surprise)
- The technology used for capturing the data (Kinect v1 sensor)
- The methodology for data collection (circular motion scanning pattern, fixed pose)

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the KinectFusion framework, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin. The citation for KinectFusion is:
> S. Izadi, D. Kim, O. Hilliges, D. Molyneaux, R. Newcombe, P. Kohli, J. Shotton, S. Hodges, D. Freeman, A. Davison, et al. *Kinectfusion: real-time 3d reconstruction and interaction using a moving depth camera*. In Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, pages 559–568. ACM, 2011.

Additionally, the authors mention another reference for the KinectFusion framework:
> R. A. Newcombe, S. Izadi, O. Hilliges, D. Molyneaux, D. Kim, A. J. Davison, P. Kohi, J. Shotton, S. Hodges, and A. Fitzgibbon. *Kinectfusion: Real-time dense surface mapping and tracking*. In Mixed and augmented reality (ISMAR), 2011 10th IEEE international symposium on, pages 127–136. IEEE, 2011.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the dataset, I will compile the details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the KF-ITW dataset as well as the references for the KinectFusion technology used to create it.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
