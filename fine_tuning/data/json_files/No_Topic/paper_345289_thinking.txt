To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting the Confidence of Generalization for L2-Stable Randomized Learning Algorithms" by Xiao-Tong Yuan and Ping Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly list the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results or experiments section** where the authors discuss their findings. They may refer to datasets while describing their experimental setup or results.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
