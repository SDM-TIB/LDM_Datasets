To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Markov model with machine learning integration for fraud detection in health insurance" by Rohan Yashraj Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a dataset of **382,587 claims**, with **38,082 claims identified as fraudulent**. This indicates that there is a significant dataset being utilized for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section (Section IV)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of claims and policy data for one policy year starting from **August 20, 2019**. The total number of claims is **382,587**, with a breakdown of fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims.

In this section, the authors also describe the features of the dataset, which include various attributes such as **Policy Number, Insured Id, Claim Identification Number, Benefit Type, Claim Status**, and others. This detailed description confirms the dataset's relevance and provides insight into its structure.

Now, I will look for any references to the dataset in the **references section** to find the full citation. However, it appears that the dataset itself is not attributed to a specific external source but is rather a proprietary dataset used by the authors for their study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from health insurance claims data without a specific citation.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or cited from another source, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Health Insurance Claims Dataset**: This dataset consists of **382,587 claims**, including **38,082 fraudulent claims**. It contains various features related to health insurance claims, such as policy numbers, diagnosis codes, and claim statuses.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate that the dataset is proprietary to the authors and does not have a formal citation.

After completing these steps, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
