To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Promoting Target Data in Context-aware Neural Machine Translation" by Harritxu Gete and Thierry Etchegoyhen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and specific characteristics.

In **subsection 5.1 (Data)**, the authors mention two main language pairs: Basque-Spanish and English-Russian. They specify the datasets used for each language pair:

1. **TANDO Corpus**: This dataset is used for Basque-Spanish translation and contains parallel data from subtitles, news, and literary documents. The authors reference it as:
   > Gete, Harritxu, Thierry Etchegoyhen, David Ponce, Gorka Labaka, Nora Aranberri, Ander Corral, Xabier Saralegi, Igor Ellakuria, and Maite Martin. *TANDO: A corpus for document-level machine translation*. In Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 3026–3037, Marseille, France, 2022.

2. **Open Subtitles Dataset**: This dataset is used for English-Russian translation and is based on excerpts from Open Subtitles. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Lison, Pierre, Jörg Tiedemann, and Milen Kouylekov. *OpenSubtitles2018: Statistical rescoring of sentence alignments in large, noisy parallel corpora*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan, 2018.

Additionally, the authors mention two contrastive datasets for Basque-Spanish translation:

- **GDR-SRC+TGT**: This dataset focuses on gender selection, with disambiguating information present in both source and target languages.
- **COH-TGT**: This dataset evaluates cases where the source language lacks necessary information for correct selection of gender or register, requiring contextual coherence from the target side.

For the contrastive datasets, the citations are as follows:

- For **GDR-SRC+TGT** and **COH-TGT**, the authors do not provide specific citations in the text, but they reference the TANDO corpus, which includes these datasets.

In **section 6 (Results)**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, confirming their relevance and importance in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, along with their respective citations for proper attribution.
