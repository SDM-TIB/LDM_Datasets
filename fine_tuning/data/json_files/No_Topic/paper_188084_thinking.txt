To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computational models: Bottom-up and top-down aspects" by Laurent Itti and Ali Borji, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research focus and may mention specific datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit references to datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will proceed to the **methods and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will identify the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide additional context or insights regarding the datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that further clarify the significance of each dataset in the context of the research.

Once I have gathered the names and descriptions of the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "MIT Saliency Benchmark" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Judd, T., Ehinger, K., Durand, F., & Torralba, A. (2009). Learning to predict where humans look. In Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2106-2113.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that clearly presents the information for each dataset, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I effectively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
