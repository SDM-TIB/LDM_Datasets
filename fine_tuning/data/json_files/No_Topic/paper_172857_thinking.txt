To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Parts for Action Localization" by Nicolas Chesneau et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method on the **JHMDB dataset** and a new dataset called **DALY**. This suggests that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **JHMDB Dataset**: This dataset is described as a standard action recognition database that contains 928 videos covering 21 action classes. It is a subset of the larger HMDB51 dataset.

2. **DALY Dataset**: This is a more challenging dataset consisting of 31 hours of YouTube videos, with spatial and temporal annotations for 10 everyday human actions. Each video lasts between 1 and 20 minutes.

Additionally, the authors mention the **LSP dataset** for analyzing their full-body box generation method, which contains 2000 pose-annotated images of mostly sports people.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **JHMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192â€“3199, 2013.

- For the **DALY Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Weinzaepfel, X. Martin, and C. Schmid. *Human Action Localization with Sparse Spatial Supervision*. arXiv, abs/1605.05197, 2016.

- For the **LSP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Johnson and M. Everingham. *Clustered Pose and Nonlinear Appearance Models for Human Pose Estimation*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2010.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
