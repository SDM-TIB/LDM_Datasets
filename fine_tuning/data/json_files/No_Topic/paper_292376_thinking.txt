To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Reliable Designs of Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Tracking Control for Euler-Lagrange Systems" by Zhikai Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention if any datasets were used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks relevant to their study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that may have used specific datasets.

I will then examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup or simulations. This section is likely to contain specific information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will look for any discussions or analyses that reference the datasets. The authors may provide performance metrics or comparisons based on the datasets, which can help confirm their relevance and importance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the original source if it is mentioned in the text.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
