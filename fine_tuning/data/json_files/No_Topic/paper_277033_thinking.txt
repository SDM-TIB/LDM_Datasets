To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Over-the-Air Membership Inference Attacks as Privacy Threats for Deep Learning-based Wireless Signal Classifiers" by Yi Shi, Kemal Davaslioglu, and Yalin E. Sagduyu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the concept of membership inference attacks (MIA) on wireless signal classifiers, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section II (System Model)** and **section III (The Classifier at the Service Provider and the Surrogate Classifier at the Adversary)**. These sections describe the system setup and the classifiers used, but they do not provide specific dataset names. I will continue to look for any references to datasets in the **experiments or results sections**.

In **section V (Numerical Results)**, the authors mention that the training data for the target model consists of 8000 signal samples, with half being class 1 samples (QPSK signals from authorized users) and the other half being class 0 samples (BPSK signals from other users). However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset. 

The paper also discusses the surrogate classifier's training data, which consists of 1000 samples, but again, no specific dataset name is provided. 

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide formal citations for the datasets used, I will note this in my extraction process. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works mention datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing various aspects of machine learning and adversarial attacks, rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper describes the types of data used (QPSK and BPSK signals) and the number of samples, it does not provide specific dataset names or formal citations for datasets. Therefore, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Training Data for Target Model**: 8000 signal samples (QPSK and BPSK signals) - No formal dataset name or citation provided.
2. **Training Data for Surrogate Classifier**: 1000 signal samples (QPSK and BPSK signals) - No formal dataset name or citation provided.

Since there are no formal citations available for the datasets, I will note that the datasets described are not publicly available or formally named in the paper. 

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing.
