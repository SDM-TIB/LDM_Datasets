To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-term Human Participation Assessment In Collaborative Learning Environments Using Dynamic Scene Analysis" by Wenjing Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a "massive independent testing dataset" is used, which suggests that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (AOLME STUDENT DATASETS)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. This section is likely to contain the most comprehensive information about the datasets, including their names, purposes, and characteristics.

In this section, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **AOLME-G Video Dataset for Student Group Detection**: This dataset consists of 54 videos from 52 groups, covering two cohorts. It is used for group detection and includes various training and testing subsets.

2. **AOLME-FR Video Face Recognition Training**: This dataset is used for training video face recognition algorithms and consists of images sampled from 13 sessions.

3. **AOLME-D Video Dataset**: This dataset is used for system testing of video face recognition and includes 13 different sessions of videos.

4. **AOLME-DST**: A short video dataset for final system testing, which contains diverse video samples used to test system performance under occlusion.

5. **AOLME-DLT**: A long video dataset for final system testing, which includes raw real-life videos.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly stated for datasets, but I will look for any papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, the AOLME dataset is likely referenced in the context of the research conducted by the authors, and I will ensure to capture the citation for the original source of the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that full citations are provided for each one.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured and ready for further processing or review.
