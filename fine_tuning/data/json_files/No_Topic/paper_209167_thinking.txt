To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Network Embedding for Graph Representation Learning in Signed Networks" by Xiao Shen and Fu-Lai Chung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three real-world signed networks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Epinions Dataset**: This dataset is described as a "who trust whom" online social network where users can express trust (positive) or distrust (negative) towards others.

2. **Slashdot Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Slashdot technology news site, where users can form relationships as friends (positive) or foes (negative).

3. **Wiki Dataset**: This dataset is extracted from Wikipedia, representing votes "for" (positive) and "against" (negative) in elections.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **Epinions Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Massa, P., & Avesani, P. (2005). Controversial users demand local trust metrics: An experimental study on epinions.com community. In Proceedings of the AAAI, 121-126.

- For the **Slashdot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kunegis, J., Lommatzsch, A., & Bauckhage, C. (2009). The Slashdot zoo: Mining a social network with negative edges. In Proceedings of the WWW, 741-750.

- For the **Wiki Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Leskovec, J., Huttenlocher, D. P., & Kleinberg, J. (2010). Governance in social media: A case study of the Wikipedia promotion process. In Proceedings of the AAAI, 98-105.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
