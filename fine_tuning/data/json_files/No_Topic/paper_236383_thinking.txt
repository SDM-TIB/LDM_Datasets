To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization by Hybridization of a Genetic Algorithm with the PROMETHEE Method: Management of Multicriteria Localization" by Myriem Alijo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or sources of data that inform their research. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for analysis. The authors may describe the data collection process, including any national or international datasets they utilized for their multicriteria analysis.

I will also examine **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as they often contain summarized data or references to datasets. For instance, Table 2 lists criteria and actions with associated data, which may indicate the datasets used.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference the World Bank data from 2012-2016, I will look for the complete citation in the references section to ensure accurate documentation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will include details such as the dataset name, description, and the authors or organizations responsible for the dataset.

Finally, I will organize the extracted datasets into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future research or applications.
