To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DAPR: A Benchmark on Document-Aware Passage Retrieval" by Kexin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark that includes multiple datasets from heterogeneous domains, which indicates that there are several datasets to look for. The introduction further elaborates on the DAPR task and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (which is likely to be labeled as such) to find explicit mentions of the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention five datasets that are unified to compose the DAPR benchmark:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is described as a question-answering dataset built from queries in the Bing search log and passages from the Bing index.

2. **Natural Questions**: This dataset is built from queries sourced from Google search logs and documents from Wikipedia pages.

3. **MIRACL**: A multilingual information-retrieval dataset, specifically the English subset, which consists of paragraphs from the English Wikipedia.

4. **Genomics**: A passage retrieval task for biomedical question answering, which includes queries about biological objects and processes.

5. **ConditionalQA**: A dataset for answering questions related to UK policies based on specific scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
