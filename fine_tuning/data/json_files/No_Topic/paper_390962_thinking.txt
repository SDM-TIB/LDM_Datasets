To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tools for Verifying Neural Modelsâ€™ Training Data" by Dami Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of "Proof-of-Training-Data" and mentions verification strategies but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **OpenWebText dataset** for training their models. This is a significant dataset, and I need to note its details.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenWebText dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Gokaslan, A., Cohen, V., Pavlick, E., & Tellex, S. (2019). *OpenWebText corpus*. 

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Pile dataset** in their experiments, specifically referring to the GitHub component of it. I will also look for the citation for the Pile dataset in the references.

The citation for the Pile dataset is:
> Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., & Leahy, C. (2020). *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **OpenWebText Dataset**: Used for training the models.
   - Citation: Gokaslan, A., Cohen, V., Pavlick, E., & Tellex, S. (2019). *OpenWebText corpus*.

2. **Pile Dataset**: Specifically, the GitHub component was used in the experiments.
   - Citation: Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., Presser, S., & Leahy, C. (2020). *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately for any further processing or review.
