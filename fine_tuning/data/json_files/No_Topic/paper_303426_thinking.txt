To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepSplit: Scalable Verification of Deep Neural Networks via Operator Splitting" by Shaoru Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for evaluating their method in the context of neural network verification. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of experiments, particularly in sections that detail the methodology or results.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR10 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

If they mention another dataset, such as **Atari games for reinforcement learning**, I would find the relevant citation, which might be:
> Mnih, V., et al. *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning*. 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clearly documented and ready for any further processing or review.
