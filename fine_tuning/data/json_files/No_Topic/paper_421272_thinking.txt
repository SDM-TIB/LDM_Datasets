To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Detection of Reviewer-Author Collusion Rings From Paper Bidding" by Steven Jecmen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted empirical analysis of **two realistic conference bidding datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their analysis. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **AAMAS Dataset**: This dataset contains a subset of real bidding data from the 2021 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems. It includes de-identified bids from reviewers and has 526 papers and 596 reviewers. The dataset is publicly available from PrefLib (Mattei and Walsh, 2013).

2. **S2ORC Dataset**: This is a semi-synthetic dataset constructed by Wu et al. (2021) that contains synthetic bids between a large subset of published computer science papers and authors from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus. It includes 2446 papers and 2483 reviewers.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **AAMAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mattei, N. and Walsh, T. (2013). PrefLib: A library for preferences. In Algorithmic Decision Theory: Third International Conference, pages 259–270. Springer.

- For the **S2ORC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, R., Guo, C., Wu, F., Kidambi, R., Van Der Maaten, L., and Weinberger, K. (2021). Making paper reviewing robust to bid manipulation attacks. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 11240–11250. PMLR.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
