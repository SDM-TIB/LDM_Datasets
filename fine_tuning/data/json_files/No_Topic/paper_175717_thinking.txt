To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Indoor Frame Recovery from Refined Line Segments" by Luanzheng Guo and Jun Chu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention any datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses the recovery of indoor frame structures from images but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of indoor scene understanding but does not specify any datasets either. 

I will then look into the **experiments section** to see if the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluated their algorithm on a collection of over 300 indoor images, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that might have been used in the experiments. The references include several papers, but I will focus on those that are likely to contain datasets relevant to indoor scene understanding.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations that may correspond to datasets used in the experiments:

1. **Hedau et al. (2009)**: This paper discusses recovering the spatial layout of cluttered rooms and may contain datasets relevant to indoor scenes.
   > V. Hedau, D. Hoiem, and D. A. Forsyth. *Recovering the spatial layout of cluttered rooms*. In ICCV, pages 1849–1856, 2009.

2. **Lee et al. (2009)**: This paper focuses on geometric reasoning for single image structure recovery and may also include datasets used for evaluation.
   > D. C. Lee, M. Hebert, and T. Kanade. *Geometric reasoning for single image structure recovery*. In CVPR, pages 2136–2143, 2009.

3. **Hedau et al. (2010)**: This paper discusses using appearance models and context based on room geometry, which may reference datasets for indoor scene understanding.
   > V. Hedau, D. Hoiem, and D. A. Forsyth. *Thinking inside the box: Using appearance models and context based on room geometry*. In ECCV (6), pages 224–237, 2010.

4. **Silberman et al. (2012)**: This paper on indoor segmentation and support inference from RGB-D images may also provide datasets relevant to indoor scenes.
   > N. Silberman, D. Hoiem, P. Kohli, and R. Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In ECCV (5), pages 746–760, 2012.

Now that I have identified potential datasets from the references, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations. Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will note that the datasets are derived from the referenced works.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately cited and described based on the information gathered from the paper and its references.
