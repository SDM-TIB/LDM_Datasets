To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross Layer Optimization and Distributed Reinforcement Learning Approach for Tile-Based 360 Degree Wireless Video Streaming" by Mounssif Krouka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of streaming 360-degree videos and mentions the use of a dataset involving users watching 360-degree videos, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the introduction, the authors refer to a "realistic dataset of users watching 360 degrees videos" and provide some context about its composition, which suggests that it is a significant part of their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the dataset used: it consists of 50 users watching 10 YouTube 360-degree videos, with data recorded for 1800 frames corresponding to 1 minute of playback. Each frame is divided into tiles, forming a grid structure. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
> W.-C. Lo, C.-L. Fan, J. Lee, C.-Y. Huang, K.-T. Chen, and C.-H. Hsu. "360◦ video viewing dataset in head-mounted virtual reality." In Proc. ACM Conf. on Multimedia Systems, 2017, pp. 211–216.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **360-degree video viewing dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 users watching 10 YouTube 360-degree videos, with each video sampled at 30 frames-per-second. The data for 1800 frames is recorded, corresponding to 1 minute of playback, and each frame consists of 200 tiles arranged in a grid.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited.
