To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Large-Scale Multimedia Datasets to Refine Content Moderation Models" by Ioannis Sarridis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of large-scale multimedia datasets for content moderation, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections, particularly section 4, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Pornography-2k**: This dataset consists of 2000 videos, with 1000 labeled as pornographic and 1000 as safe for work (SFW). It is noted for its high data diversity, including various genres and types of content.

2. **DID (Disturbing Image Dataset)**: This dataset contains 5401 images, with 2043 labeled as disturbing and 3358 as non-disturbing. It is mentioned as one of the largest datasets available for this type of content moderation task.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **NudeNet dataset** and **YFCC100m** as sources for positive and negative samples in their model adaptation strategies. The YFCC100m dataset is a large-scale multimedia dataset containing 99.2 million images and 0.8 million videos, which is used for collecting unlabeled data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Pornography-2k**, the citation is:
  > M. Perez et al. "Video pornography detection through deep learning techniques and motion information." *Neurocomputing*, vol. 230, pp. 279–293, 2017.

- For **DID**, the citation is:
  > M. Zampoglou et al. "A web-based service for disturbing image detection." In *International Conference on Multimedia Modeling*, Springer, 2017, pp. 438–441.

- For **NudeNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Archive. (2019) Nudenet dataset. [Online]. Available: https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1

- For **YFCC100m**, the citation is:
  > B. Thomee et al. "YFCC100m: The new data in multimedia research." *Communications of the ACM*, vol. 59, no. 2, pp. 64–73, 2016.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
