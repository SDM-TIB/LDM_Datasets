To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing and Fine-tuning Large Language Model for Urban Renewal" by Xi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study involves generating QA datasets using urban renewal scientific literature, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the process of generating the QA dataset. They mention collecting about 70-80 scientific articles related to urban renewal, which serves as the source for the dataset. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, so I will note it as a generated dataset based on urban renewal literature.

In the same section, the authors detail the steps taken to preprocess the text and generate QA pairs, but again, they do not provide a formal name for the dataset. I will refer to this dataset as the **Urban Renewal QA Dataset** for clarity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any specific datasets are cited. The references primarily focus on the literature used to generate the QA dataset rather than established datasets. However, I will note the references that are relevant to the urban renewal literature corpus used for dataset generation.

The references include various studies that contribute to the understanding of urban renewal, but they do not correspond to a specific dataset. Therefore, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Urban Renewal QA Dataset**: This dataset is generated from approximately 70-80 scientific articles related to urban renewal. It includes questions and answers derived from the literature, but no formal citation exists since it is a newly created dataset based on the authors' methodology.

2. **Cited Literature**: While the paper does not reference a specific dataset, it cites numerous studies that inform the context of urban renewal. These references can be useful for understanding the background of the generated dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the literature that informed the dataset generation.

The citations for the relevant literature are as follows:

- Zhou Y, Li X, Asrar G, et al. "A global record of annual urban dynamics (1992-2013) from nighttime lights." *Remote Sensing of Environment: An Interdisciplinary Journal*, 2018, 219.
- Gong P. "Remote sensing of environmental change over China: A review." *Chinese Science Bulletin*, 2012, 57: 2793-2801.
- Angel S, Parent J, Civco D L, et al. "The dimensions of global urban expansion: Estimates and projections for all countries, 2000â€“2050." *Progress in Planning*, 2011, 75(2): 53-107. DOI:10.1016/j.progress.2011.04.001.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that the generated dataset is clearly identified and the relevant literature is properly cited.
