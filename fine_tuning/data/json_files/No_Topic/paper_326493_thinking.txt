To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fortunately, Discourse Markers Can Enhance Language Models for Sentiment Analysis" by Liat Ein-Dor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "various benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3.4 (Evaluation Details)**, where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used for evaluation. The table clearly outlines the datasets along with their domains and test set sizes:

1. **amazon**: This dataset consists of product reviews, with a test set size of 2,000 sentences.
2. **yelp**: This dataset includes business reviews, with a test set size of 20,000 sentences.
3. **sst2**: This dataset is composed of movie reviews, with a test set size of 1,821 sentences.
4. **fpb75**: This dataset contains sentences from financial news, with a test set size of 691 sentences.

The paper also provides a reference for each dataset in the table, which is crucial for proper citation. I will extract these references to ensure I have the full citations for each dataset.

The references for the datasets are as follows:

- For **amazon**, the citation is:
  > Keung, P., Lu, Y., Szarvas, G., & Smith, N. A. (2020). *The Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For **yelp**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, J., Zhao, Y., Saleh, M., & Liu, P. (2015). *Character-Level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems.

- For **sst2**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. (2018). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP.

- For **fpb75**, the citation is:
  > Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., & Takala, P. (2014). *Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts*. Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
