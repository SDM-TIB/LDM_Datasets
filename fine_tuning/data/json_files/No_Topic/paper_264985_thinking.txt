To extract datasets from the research paper titled "User Profiling Trends, Techniques and Applications" by Sumitkumar Kanoje et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing techniques and applications** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses user profiling and its importance in recommender systems, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in user profiling research. The introduction focuses on the concept of user profiling but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **techniques section**, I will look for any methodologies that might involve datasets. The authors discuss various profiling techniques, such as explicit and implicit user profiling, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

In the **applications section**, the authors describe several applications of user profiling, such as recommender systems and e-tourism, but they do not cite any datasets used in these applications.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any papers that might have associated datasets. The references include various studies on user profiling, but they do not explicitly mention datasets that can be extracted.

Since the paper does not provide any specific datasets or their citations, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular research paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper "User Profiling Trends, Techniques and Applications" by Sumitkumar Kanoje et al., and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
