To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrinsic Image Decomposition via Ordinal Shading" by Chris Careaga and Yağız Aksoy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets that are foundational to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention deriving a dataset from the **Multiple Illuminations Dataset** by Murmann et al. [2019]. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work** section, as it often references other datasets that have been used in similar studies. The authors mention the **Intrinsic Images in-the-Wild (IIW)** dataset and the **Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW)** dataset, which are relevant to their work.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

1. **Multiple Illuminations Dataset**:
   > Murmann, L., Gharbi, M., Aittala, M., & Durand, F. (2019). A Multi-Illumination Dataset of Indoor Object Appearance. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

2. **Intrinsic Images in-the-Wild (IIW)**:
   > Bell, S., Bala, K., & Snavely, N. (2014). Intrinsic Images in the Wild. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 33(4), 1-12.

3. **Shading Annotations in the Wild (SAW)**:
   > Kovacs, B., Bell, S., Snavely, N., & Bala, K. (2017). Shading Annotations in the Wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
