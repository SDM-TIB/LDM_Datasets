To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Attentive Residual Decoder for Neural Machine Translation" by Lesly Miculicich Werlen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experimental Settings)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention three language pairs: English-Chinese, Spanish-English, and English-German. They describe the datasets associated with each language pair, including the number of sentence pairs used for training, development, and testing.

1. **UN Parallel Corpus**: For the English-to-Chinese translation, the authors specify that they used a subset of the UN parallel corpus, which consists of 0.5 million sentence pairs for training, 2,000 for development, and 2,000 for testing. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rafalovitch, A., & Dale, R. (2009). United Nations General Assembly resolutions: A six-language parallel corpus. In Proceedings of the MT Summit, volume 12, pages 292–299.

2. **WMT 2013 Dataset**: For the Spanish-to-English translation, the authors utilized a subset of the WMT 2013 dataset, specifically Europarl v7 and News Commentary v11, which contains approximately 2.1 million sentence pairs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Buck, C., Callison-Burch, C., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Koehn, P., Monz, C., Post, M., Soricut, R., & Specia, L. (2013). Findings of the 2013 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation. In Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–44.

3. **WMT 2016 Dataset**: For the English-to-German translation, the authors mention using the complete WMT 2016 dataset, which includes around 4.5 million sentence pairs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bojar, O., Chatterjee, R., Federmann, C., Graham, Y., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Jimeno Yepes, A., Koehn, P., Logacheva, V., Monz, C., Negri, M., Neveol, A., Neves, M., Popel, M., Post, M., Rubino, R., Scarton, C., Specia, L., Turchi, M., Verspoor, K., & Zampieri, M. (2016). Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, pages 131–198.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
