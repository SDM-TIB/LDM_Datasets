To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Learning of Ordinal Embeddings: A User Study on Football Data" by Christoffer LÃ¶ffler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a "large football trajectory dataset," which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details about the dataset. The authors mention using a dataset from the German Bundesliga from the 2014/15 season, which consists of trajectories sampled at 25 Hz extracted from multi-perspective video feeds. This gives me a specific dataset to note.

In the **experimental design section (Section 3)**, the authors provide further details about the dataset. They specify that they extracted scenes of 5 seconds in length with a 50% overlap, yielding 1,005 samples for the game. This information is crucial for describing the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific league and season, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The relevant dataset I have identified is:

1. **Football Trajectory Dataset**: This dataset consists of trajectories from the German Bundesliga, season 2014/15, with 1,005 samples extracted from multi-perspective video feeds, each sampled at 25 Hz.

Since there are no formal citations for this dataset in the references, I will summarize the dataset details as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include all relevant information about the dataset as per the requirements.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
