To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TVNet: Temporal Voting Network for Action Localization" by Hanyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved an average mAP of 34.6% on **ActivityNet-1.3** and 56.0% on **THUMOS14**. This indicates that these two datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction confirms that the authors evaluate their method on **ActivityNet-1.3** and **THUMOS14**, reinforcing the importance of these datasets.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, specifically **4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors provide more details about the datasets. They describe **ActivityNet-1.3** as consisting of 19,994 videos with 200 classes and **THUMOS14** as containing 413 untrimmed videos with 20 classes. This section solidifies my understanding of the datasets used.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ActivityNet-1.3**, the citation is:
   > Caba Heilbron, F., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., & Carlos Niebles, J. (2015). *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

2. For **THUMOS14**, the citation is:
   > Jiang, Y., Liu, J., Zamir, A. R., Toderici, G., Laptev, I., Shah, M., & Sukthankar, R. (2014). *THUMOS challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. In European Conference on Computer Vision Workshop.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **ActivityNet-1.3**: A large-scale video dataset consisting of 19,994 videos across 200 classes, used for evaluating action localization methods.
- **THUMOS14**: A dataset containing 413 untrimmed videos with 20 classes, specifically designed for action localization tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
