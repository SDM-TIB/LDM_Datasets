To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward smart composites: small-scale, untethered prediction and control for soft sensor/actuator systems" by Sarah Aguasvivas Manzano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant metrics. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including any names or identifiers.

In this paper, the authors describe two experimental rigs: a tendon-based platform and a HASEL-based platform. I will check if they provide any specific datasets related to these platforms. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the collection of training data from a four-camera motion capture system (Optitrack) and the use of synthetic data generated from a mass-spring-damper system. I will note these datasets:

1. **Tendon-based platform dataset**: This dataset consists of time series data collected from the sensor signals, the motion capture system, and the servo inputs. The authors mention that this dataset contains 3.8 million samples.

2. **HASEL-based platform dataset**: Similar to the tendon-based platform, this dataset also includes time series data collected from the sensors and the motion capture system, with a collection rate of 200 Hz, downsampled to 130 Hz for training.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets or any related works that describe the datasets in detail. 

For the **Optitrack motion capture system**, I will note that it is a commercial system, and I will provide the citation for the system itself if available. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations:

- For the **Tendon-based platform dataset**, I will cite the paper as follows:
  > Aguasvivas Manzano S, Xu P, Ly K, Shepherd R, Correll N. *High-bandwidth nonlinear control for soft actuators with recursive network models*. In: International Symposium on Experimental Robotics. Springer; 2020. p. 589â€“599.

- For the **HASEL-based platform dataset**, I will use the same citation as it is part of the same study.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset, including their purpose, size, and any relevant metrics, and prepare to present this information in a structured format for further use.
