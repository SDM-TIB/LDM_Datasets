To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lifelong Learning of Graph Neural Networks for Open-World Node Classification" by Lukas Galke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "three new lifelong node classification datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present and need to be identified.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Experimental Apparatus)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **PharmaBio Dataset**: This dataset is a co-authorship graph dataset where the classes are journal categories. It is generated based on scientific publications with specific thresholds for publications per class and author.

2. **DBLP-easy Dataset**: This dataset is a citation graph based on the DBLP database, where the classes correspond to conferences and journals. It has a minimum threshold of publications per class per year.

3. **DBLP-hard Dataset**: Similar to DBLP-easy, this dataset is also a citation graph from DBLP but with a more stringent threshold for publications, resulting in a higher number of classes.

In the same section, the authors provide a summary table (Table I) that includes the characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of vertices, edges, features, and classes, which further confirms their details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors mention that they publicly provide the datasets along with their implementation on Zenodo and GitHub, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PharmaBio Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Galke, L., Franke, B., Zielke, T., & Scherp, A. (2021). Lifelong Learning of Graph Neural Networks for Open-World Node Classification. In *2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)*, pages 1-8. doi:10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533412.

- For the **DBLP-easy Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Galke, L., Franke, B., Zielke, T., & Scherp, A. (2021). Lifelong Learning of Graph Neural Networks for Open-World Node Classification. In *2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)*, pages 1-8. doi:10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533412.

- For the **DBLP-hard Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Galke, L., Franke, B., Zielke, T., & Scherp, A. (2021). Lifelong Learning of Graph Neural Networks for Open-World Node Classification. In *2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)*, pages 1-8. doi:10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9533412.

Since all three datasets are introduced in the same paper, they share the same citation format.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for any further processing or review.
