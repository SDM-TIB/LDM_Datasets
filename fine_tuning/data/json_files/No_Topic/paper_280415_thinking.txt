To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration of Whether Skylight Polarization Patterns Contain Three-dimensional Attitude Information" by Huaju Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of polarized light for navigation and reference various studies that may imply the existence of datasets, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the parts where the authors describe their experimental setup and simulations. Here, they mention using a "hypothetical polarization imager" and conducting experiments to capture polarization images, but they do not specify any publicly available datasets.

I will also check the **results section** for any mention of datasets used for validation or comparison. The authors discuss simulation results and experimental findings but do not cite any external datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. However, the references primarily consist of studies and papers that discuss concepts related to the research but do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets or mention any specific datasets in their research. Instead, they focused on simulations and experiments conducted with their own data collection methods.

Since no datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. 

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses the methodology and results of their research, it does not reference any external datasets that can be cited. This is an important aspect to note for future research or for readers looking for datasets related to skylight polarization and 3D attitude estimation.
