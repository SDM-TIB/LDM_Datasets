To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantically Constrained Memory Allocation (SCMA) for Embedding in Efficient Recommendation Systems" by Aditya Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate their method on the **Criteo** and **Avazu** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors summarize the properties of the datasets in **Table 1**, which includes:

1. **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset has 46 million samples, consisting of 26 categorical features and 13 integer features, with a positive rate of 26% and a total of 33.76 million unique values.

2. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset contains 41 million samples, with 21 categorical features and no integer features, a positive rate of 17%, and a total of 9.45 million unique values.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of recommendation systems. Therefore, I will provide the general references for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- For the **Criteo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Labs: Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-ads-challenge/data.

- For the **Avazu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
