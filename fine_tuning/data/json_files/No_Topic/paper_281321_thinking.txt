To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatentMatch: A Dataset for Matching Patent Claims & Prior Art" by Julian Risch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a training dataset called **PatentMatch**, which is a strong lead for the dataset I need to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (PatentMatch Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the dataset as containing pairs of claims from patent applications and corresponding text passages from prior art, labeled by patent examiners. The dataset consists of **6,259,703 samples**, which is a significant amount of data.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset is based on the **EP full-text data for text analytics by the EPO**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin and structure. They provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of distinct patent applications and cited documents, which further confirms its comprehensiveness.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **EP full-text data**. The authors reference the EPO's bulk data sets, which is essential for proper attribution. The citation for this dataset is:
> European Patent Office. *EP full-text data for text analytics*. Available at: https://www.epo.org/searching-for-patents/data/bulk-data-sets/text-analytics.

Additionally, I will note that the **PatentMatch dataset** itself is available online, and the authors provide a link for access. The citation for the PatentMatch dataset is:
> Julian Risch, Christoph Hewel, Nicolas Alder, and Ralf Krestel. *PatentMatch: A Dataset for Matching Patent Claims & Prior Art*. Available at: https://hpi.de/naumann/s/patentmatch.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the **PatentMatch dataset** and the **EP full-text data**. This will ensure that the datasets are properly attributed and can be referenced in future work.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise representation of the datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further use or analysis.
