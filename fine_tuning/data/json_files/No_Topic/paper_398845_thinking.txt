To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AmbientFlow: Invertible generative models from incomplete, noisy measurements" by Varun A. Kelkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for large, high-quality datasets for training generative models, which suggests that datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical studies section (Section 4)**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for the problem of recovering the distribution of handwritten digits. It is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the face image study, which involves images of size 64x64x3.

3. **FastMRI Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the stylized MRI study, specifically T2-weighted brain images from the FastMRI initiative.

I will now look for specific details about each dataset, including the number of samples, any preprocessing steps, and the context in which they were used. 

In the **numerical studies section**, the authors provide the following details:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, they mention using images of handwritten digits and describe the forward models applied to the dataset.

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, they specify that it consists of face images and detail the measurement noise and forward models used.

- For the **FastMRI Dataset**, they describe the images used and the simulation of stylized MRI measurements.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**:
  > Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, and Jaakko Lehtinen. *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196, 2017.

- For the **FastMRI Dataset**:
  > Jure Zbontar et al. *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the full citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.
