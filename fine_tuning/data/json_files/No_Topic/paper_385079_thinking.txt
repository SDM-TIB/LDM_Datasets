To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CTQScorer: Combining Multiple Features for In-context Example Selection for Machine Translation" by Aswanth Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on multiple language pairs and models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (4.1)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Samanantar**: This dataset is described as a large parallel corpus for multiple Indic languages, containing 8.6 million pairs for Bengali, 3.1 million for Gujarati, and 10.1 million for Hindi.

2. **Europarl**: A well-known parallel corpus used for machine translation, with 1.9 million pairs for French and 1.8 million for German.

3. **ParaCrawl**: Another large parallel corpus, which contains 5.4 million pairs for Russian.

In the **experiments section (4.3)**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for their machine translation experiments, reinforcing their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Samanantar**, the citation is:
  > Gowtham Ramesh, Sumanth Doddapaneni, Aravinth Bheemaraj, et al. *Samanantar: The largest publicly available parallel corpora collection for 11 Indic languages*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10:145–162, 2022.

- For **Europarl**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of machine translation summit x: papers, pages 79–86, 2005.

- For **ParaCrawl**, the citation is:
  > Marta Bañón, Pinzhen Chen, Barry Haddow, et al. *ParaCrawl: Web-scale acquisition of parallel corpora*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 4555–4567, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
