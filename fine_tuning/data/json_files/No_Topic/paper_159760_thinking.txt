To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Learning in a Hierarchical Multiscale Neural Network" by Thomas Wolf, Julien Chaumond, and Clement Delangue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of language models and their applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention using the **Wikitext-2 dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a dataset used for language modeling tasks, which is a clear indication that it is relevant to their work.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Wikitext-2 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Wikitext-2 Dataset**: 
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. arXiv:1609.07843 [cs]. ArXiv: 1609.07843.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Wikitext-2 Dataset**: Used for language modeling tasks, as indicated in the experiments section.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
