To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Self-Supervised Learning in Medical Imaging" by Fernando Navarro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which hints at the datasets used for pneumonia detection and multi-organ segmentation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **Pneumonia Detection Dataset**: This dataset consists of 244,483 frontal X-ray images with binary annotations for pneumonia. The authors mention that the dataset is sourced from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and includes a test set of 3,024 images.

2. **Multi-organ Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the VISCERAL dataset, which includes CT scans with annotations for up to 20 different organs or structures. The authors specify that they selected scans containing all 20 structures, resulting in 74 scans for the Silver Corpus and 22 for the Gold Corpus.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Pneumonia Detection Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., et al. "Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In Proceedings of the IEEE CVPR, 2017.

- For the **Multi-organ Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jimenez-del Toro, O., et al. "Cloud-based evaluation of anatomical structure segmentation and landmark detection algorithms: Visceral anatomy benchmarks." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 35(11), 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
