To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformation Coding: Simple Objectives for Equivariant Representations" by Mehran Shakerinava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 7), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, I will pay particular attention to any figures or tables that may summarize the datasets or their characteristics. For example, the authors may describe datasets like the **Pendulum**, **Mountain Car**, or **Rotating Chair** environments, which are mentioned in the context of their experiments.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the paper mentions the **Pendulum** dataset, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced this dataset and note its citation. The same goes for any other datasets mentioned, such as the **Mountain Car** or **Rotating Chair** datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, including all authors, title, publication venue, and year, to maintain academic integrity and facilitate further research.
