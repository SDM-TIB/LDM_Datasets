To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring Non-Typical Emotions for Mental Health: A Survey of Computational Approaches" by Puneet Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the analysis of non-typical emotions and the importance of datasets in this context, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used for analyzing stress, depression, and engagement. This section is likely to contain the names and descriptions of the datasets, which are crucial for my extraction process.

In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets for Stress Analysis)**, the paper lists several datasets:
1. **Spontaneous Micro-Gesture (SMG) dataset**: Contains 821,056 frames of video data from 40 adults, focusing on stress and micro-gestures.
2. **Mental Workload Assessment on n-back task Using Wearable Sensor (MAUS) dataset**: Collected from 22 adults in a lab setting using physiological sensors.
3. **Ulm Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) dataset**: A German dataset with data from 105 participants gathered through interviews.

In **subsection 3.2 (Datasets for Depression Analysis)**, I find additional datasets:
1. **Chi-Mei Mood Database**: Focuses on mood disorders.
2. **Extended DAIC dataset**: A dataset for depression analysis using audio-visual cues.
3. **SH2 dataset**: Includes recordings of individuals in everyday settings for depression detection.

In **subsection 3.3 (Datasets for Engagement Analysis)**, the paper describes datasets related to engagement:
1. **DAiSEE dataset**: Contains 9,068 video clips from 112 users, focusing on engagement in educational environments.
2. **EngageWild dataset**: Presents videos annotated across four engagement levels.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary resources to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for the **SMG dataset** is:
> Chen, H., Shi, H., et al. "SMG: A Micro-gesture Dataset Towards Spontaneous Body Gestures for Emotional Stress State Analysis." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 131, no. 6, pp. 1346â€“1366, 2023.

I will repeat this process for each dataset identified in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
