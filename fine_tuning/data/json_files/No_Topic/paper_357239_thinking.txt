To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation within Tight Localities: A Theoretical and Experimental Analysis" by Laurent Amsaleg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

In the experimental framework, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. For instance, the authors mention several datasets in Table 3, which lists real data sets used in the experiments. The datasets include:

1. **ALOI**: A dataset consisting of 110,250 color photos of 1,000 different objects.
2. **ANN SIFT1M**: A dataset with 106 128-dimensional SIFT descriptors.
3. **BCI5**: A brain-computer interface dataset with brain signal recordings.
4. **CoverType**: A dataset with 581,012 geographical locations described by 54 attributes.
5. **Gisette**: A subset of the MNIST dataset with 5,000 samples and 2,500 features.
6. **Isolet**: A dataset of 7,797 human voice recordings.
7. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits with 70,000 samples.
8. **MSD**: A subset of the Million Song Dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **ALOI**: Boujemaa, N., Fauqueur, J., Ferecatu, M., Fleuret, F., Gouet, V., LeSaux, B., & Sahbi, H. (2001). IKONA for interactive specific and generic image retrieval. In CBMI.

- **MSD**: Bertin-Mahieux, T., Ellis, D. P. W., Whitman, B., & Lamere, P. (2011). The million song dataset. In ISMIR.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
