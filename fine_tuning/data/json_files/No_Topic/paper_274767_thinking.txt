To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Massive Device Connectivity: Joint Activity Detection and Channel Estimation" by Shuhao Xia and Yuanming Shi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the problem of activity detection and channel estimation in an IRS-assisted IoT network but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction outlines the context and significance of the research but does not specify any datasets used for experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments or simulation section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to see if the authors mention any datasets used for their simulations or evaluations. In this case, the paper describes a simulation setup but does not reference any specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the study. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers and articles that discuss methodologies and theoretical frameworks rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. The authors focus on theoretical modeling and simulation results without relying on external datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. Instead, I will summarize the findings and methodologies discussed in the paper, noting the absence of specific datasets used for the research.
