To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey on Image Quality Assessment" by Lanjiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on image quality assessment (IQA) and mentions the importance of datasets in this field. This indicates that I should look for specific datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets commonly used in IQA. This section is crucial as it will contain the names and descriptions of the datasets.

In this section, the author mentions several datasets:

1. **LIVE Dataset**: Created by the LIVE Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, it contains 29 reference images with various types of distortions. The dataset provides Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) for the distorted images.

2. **TID2008 Dataset**: Developed by Tampere University of Technology, it includes 25 color reference images with multiple distortion types and levels, providing Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for evaluation.

3. **TID2013 Dataset**: Also from Tampere University, this dataset expands on TID2008 with more reference images and distortion types, providing DMOS values based on extensive observer ratings.

4. **CSIQ Dataset**: Established by Oklahoma State University, it contains 30 reference images with various distortions and provides DMOS values based on subjective ratings.

5. **LIVE MD Dataset**: This dataset includes multiple distorted images created by combining different types of distortions and provides DMOS for each distorted image.

6. **LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database**: This dataset consists of real images captured under various conditions, with subjective quality scores obtained through crowdsourcing.

7. **KonIQ-10k Dataset**: Built at the University of Konstanz, this dataset addresses the need for larger true distortion datasets and includes a wide range of distortions with extensive subjective evaluations.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will compile are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries and their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
