To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Identification of Dynamic Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks" by Shen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Data Collection," "Experiments," or "Case Studies."** In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and the data they collected for system identification, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used.

In the **case studies section**, the authors describe two networks: the **Three-node network** and the **Net1 network**. They provide details about the components of these networks, including the number of junctions, pipes, and sensors, which indicates that these networks serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then compile the details of these datasets:

1. **Three-node network**: This dataset includes a simple network with specific components (junctions, pipes, pumps, tanks, and reservoirs) and is used to illustrate the applicability of the SysID methods.

2. **Net1 network**: This dataset is a more complex network with multiple components and is used to test the performance of the SysID algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. The authors may reference previous studies or datasets that were used to construct these networks or that provide foundational data for their analysis.

After gathering the necessary information, I will ensure to write the full citations for each dataset. For example, if the authors refer to foundational work or datasets in their methodology, I will include those citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, which is critical for proper attribution and further research.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the paper effectively, ensuring that all relevant information is captured and cited appropriately.
