To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symplectic discrete-time energy-based control for nonlinear mechanical systems" by Paul Kotyczka and Tobias Thoma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can give clues about the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where datasets are discussed in detail. I will look for any specific datasets used in the simulations or experiments. The authors may describe the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and relevance to the study.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their outcomes. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the "Mass-Spring System Dataset" or "Two-Link Robot Arm Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is publicly available, I will note the source or repository where it can be accessed.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant information for future use or analysis.
