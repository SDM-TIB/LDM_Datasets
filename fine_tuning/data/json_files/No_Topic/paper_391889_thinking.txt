To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Importance Sampling for Minimization of Tail Risks: A Tutorial" by Anand Deo and Karthyek Murthy, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on importance sampling and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations. This section discusses the challenges of estimating tail risks and mentions the use of Monte Carlo methods, but again, it does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **methodology** and **experiments sections** to find any datasets used for simulations or examples. If the authors describe specific experiments or case studies, they may reference datasets used in those contexts.

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. The references may include foundational papers or datasets that the authors used in their work.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its full citation in the references section.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for specific datasets in the experiments or case studies described.
3. Check the references section for full citations of any datasets mentioned.
4. Document each dataset with its full citation for clarity and completeness.
