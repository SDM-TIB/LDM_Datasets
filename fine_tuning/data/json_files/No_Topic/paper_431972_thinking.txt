To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Derivatives of Risk Measures" by Battulga Gankhuu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the author mentions any datasets or data sources. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted and the data used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper discusses specific datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., continuous, discrete), and any specific conditions or splits used in the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will search for authoritative sources or original papers that describe the dataset to ensure accurate citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited.
