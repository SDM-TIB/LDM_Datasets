To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XLM-E: Cross-lingual Language Model Pre-training via ELECTRA" by Zewen Chi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the model is pretrained on both multilingual and parallel corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, they mention using the **CC-100 dataset** for the replaced token detection task and several parallel corpora for the translation replaced token detection task. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets:

1. **CC-100 Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing texts in 100 languages collected from the CommonCrawl dump. This dataset is crucial for their multilingual replaced token detection task.

2. **Parallel Corpora**: The authors list several sources for the parallel corpora used in the translation replaced token detection task, including:
   - **MultiUN**: A dataset containing translation pairs in multiple languages.
   - **IIT Bombay**: A parallel corpus for English-Hindi translations.
   - **OPUS**: A collection of parallel data from various sources.
   - **WikiMatrix**: A dataset mined from Wikipedia containing parallel sentences in many languages.
   - **CCAligned**: A dataset of aligned web documents across languages.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WikiMatrix dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets are documented with their proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.
