To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Retrieval-based Conversational Recommendation" by Ahtsham Manzoor and Dietmar Jannach, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a user study and references to datasets, which indicates that there may be specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will pay close attention to the **introduction** where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the **ReDial dataset** as a prominent example of a dialog corpus used for conversational recommender systems. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments. The authors describe their system's architecture and mention that they used the **ReDial dataset** for the movies domain. They also reference the **MovieLens dataset** for recommendation strategies, which is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ReDial Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Manzoor, A., & Jannach, D. (2021). *ReDial: A Dataset for Conversational Recommendations in the Movie Domain*. In Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys), 2021.

2. **MovieLens Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4), 1-19.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
