To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debugging Non-Ground ASP Programs" by Carmine Dodaro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the empirical analysis or experiments, so I will pay close attention to that section.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of any datasets utilized in the research. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the authors describe any datasets used for testing or evaluation, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper mentions any datasets but does not provide full citations, I will need to conduct a brief search to find the original sources of those datasets. This may involve looking up the dataset names in academic databases or repositories.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the information according to the specified requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset entry.
