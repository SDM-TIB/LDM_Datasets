To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sketch2Saliency: Learning to Detect Salient Objects from Human Drawings" by Ayan Kumar Bhunia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of sketches as weak labels for detecting salient objects, which suggests that there may be datasets involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors state that they used the **Sketchy dataset** for training their model, which is a crucial dataset for their experiments. The Sketchy dataset is described as containing photo-sketch pairs of 125 classes, with a total of 75,471 sketches representing 12,500 photos.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their model on several benchmark datasets, including:

1. **ECSSD**: A dataset consisting of 1000 natural images with numerous objects of different orientations.
2. **DUT-OMRON**: This dataset contains a total of 5168 challenging images with one or more salient objects placed in complex backgrounds.
3. **PASCAL-S**: A subset of the PASCAL VOC2010 segmentation challenge, incorporating a total of 850 natural images.
4. **MSRA5K**: A collection of 5000 natural images.
5. **SOD**: A dataset containing 300 images, mainly created for image segmentation.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets.

  > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In ICCV, 2001.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
