To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A computational approach to visual ecology with deep reinforcement learning" by Sacha Sokoloski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets that are foundational to their research or that they compare their results against. This section often provides context for the study and may highlight key datasets.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the tasks they implemented, such as the foraging task, and the specific datasets they utilized to model the visual environment. This section is crucial for identifying the datasets directly involved in the research.

I will also examine the **results and discussion sections** for any additional references to datasets. The authors may discuss the performance of their models on specific datasets or compare their findings to previous work that utilized certain datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for providing accurate and complete citations.

From my reading, I anticipate that the following datasets may be relevant:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset used for image classification tasks, which the authors mention in the context of visual complexity.
2. **MNIST**: Another widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition, referenced in the context of task complexity.
3. **ViZDoom**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is a simulation environment that the authors used to create their visual tasks.

I will ensure to extract the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **ViZDoom**, the citation is:
  > Schulze, C., & Schulze, M. (2019). ViZDoom: DRQN with Prioritized Experience Replay, Double-Q Learning and Snapshot Ensembling. In *Intelligent Systems and Applications* (pp. 1-17). Springer International Publishing.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
