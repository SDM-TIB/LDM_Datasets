To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Dataset for Heterogeneous Multitask Learning" by Fisher Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of **BDD100K**, which is described as the largest driving video dataset with 100K videos and 10 tasks. This indicates that the dataset is central to the paper's contributions.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **main body of the paper** is likely to contain a dedicated section on datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or similar. In this case, I will focus on **section 3 (BDD100K)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail.

In section 3, the authors provide comprehensive information about the **BDD100K dataset**, including its size, diversity, and the various tasks it supports. They mention that the dataset consists of over 100K diverse video clips collected from various geographic locations and under different weather conditions. This section will be crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and applications.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets that are compared to or used alongside BDD100K. The authors mention several existing datasets in the context of lane marking, object detection, and multiple object tracking. I will extract these datasets as well.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified in the paper along with their full citations. The key datasets mentioned are:

1. **BDD100K**: The primary dataset discussed in the paper.

6. **VPGNet**: A dataset for lane and road marking detection.
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
