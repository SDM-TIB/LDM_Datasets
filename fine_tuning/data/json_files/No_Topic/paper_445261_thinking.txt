To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Massive Multilingual Holistic Bias" by Xiaoqing Ellen Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the presence of the **MASSIVE MULTILINGUAL HOLISTICBIAS (MMHB)** dataset, which consists of approximately 6 million sentences across 8 languages, representing 13 demographic axes. This is a strong indication that I need to focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the MMHB dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset's construction, including its linguistic features and the demographic axes it covers. They also mention that the MMHB dataset is built upon previous datasets like **HOLISTICBIAS** and **MULTILINGUALHOLISTICBIAS**. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they utilize the MMHB dataset for evaluating gender bias and added toxicity in machine translation tasks. This confirms that MMHB is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MASSIVE MULTILINGUAL HOLISTICBIAS (MMHB)**:
   - Citation:
     > Tan, X. E., Hansanti, P., Wood, C., Yu, B., Ropers, C., Costa-jussà, M. R. *Towards Massive Multilingual Holistic Bias*. Submission to Neurips 2024.

2. **HOLISTICBIAS**:
   - Citation:
     > Smith, E. M., Hall, M., Kambadur, M., Presani, E., & Williams, A. *“I’m sorry to hear that”: Finding new biases in language models with a holistic descriptor dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 9180–9211, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, December 2022. Association for Computational Linguistics. URL https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.625.

3. **MULTILINGUALHOLISTICBIAS**:
   - Citation:
     > Costa-jussà, M., Andrews, P., Smith, E., & Ropers, C. *Multilingual holistic bias: Extending descriptors and patterns to unveil demographic biases in languages at scale*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 14141–14156, Singapore, December 2023. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.874. URL https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.874.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
