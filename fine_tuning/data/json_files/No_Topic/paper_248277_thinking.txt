To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Was there COVID-19 back in 2012? – Challenge for AI in Diagnosis with Similar Indications" by Imon Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated two models on three publicly available datasets and one institutional dataset, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **ChexPert v1.0**: This dataset contains 224,316 chest X-rays (CXRs) from 65,240 patients, acquired between October 2002 and July 2017. It is labeled with 14 different disease labels.

2. **ChestX-ray14**: This dataset includes 108,948 frontal-view CXRs from 32,717 unique patients, collected from 1992 to 2015. It has 14 disease labels identified through text mining from associated radiology reports.

3. **MIMIC-CXR**: The MIMIC-CXR-JPG v2.0.0 dataset consists of 377,110 CXRs associated with 227,827 patients sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2011 and 2016. The labels are extracted from free-text radiology reports using natural language processing.

4. **EMORY Dataset**: This institutional dataset includes 4,176 CXRs from 1,786 patients treated across four EMORY Healthcare hospitals between January and May 2020. The dataset is labeled based on RT-PCR test results for COVID-19.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ChexPert v1.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar et al. "Chexnet: Radiologist-level pneumonia detection on chest x-rays with deep learning." In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05225 (2017).

- For **ChestX-ray14**, the citation is:
  > Xiaosong Wang et al. "Chestxray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases." In: Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2017, pp. 2097–2106.

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Paul Mooney et al. "MIMIC-CXR: A large publicly available database of chest radiographs." In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042 (2019).

- For the **EMORY Dataset**, since it is an institutional dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note that it was collected from EMORY Healthcare hospitals.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
