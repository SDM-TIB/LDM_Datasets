To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A note on adjusting R2 for using with cross-validation" by Indrė Zliobaitė and Nikolaj Tatti, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or utilized in the research. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific dataset mentions.

Next, I will examine the **background section** to see if any datasets are discussed in the context of R2 calculations or cross-validation methods. The authors may refer to standard datasets used in their experiments or examples.

Since the paper primarily focuses on a methodological adjustment rather than empirical results, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets in the **proofs or mathematical sections**. If the authors cite any datasets used for illustrative purposes or examples, I will note those.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

In this specific paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned for empirical validation or experiments. The focus is on theoretical adjustments to R2, and while it references the concept of cross-validation, it does not provide specific datasets used in any experiments.

However, the paper does reference a foundational text in the field of statistical learning, which is:

- **The Elements of Statistical Learning** by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman. Springer, 2009.

This reference may imply the use of datasets commonly associated with statistical learning, but it does not specify any particular datasets used in the context of this paper.

Since no specific datasets are identified, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to compile their details and citations accordingly.

In summary, I will document my findings, noting that while the paper discusses R2 adjustments and cross-validation, it does not explicitly mention any datasets for empirical analysis. If datasets had been mentioned, I would have structured the information accordingly, ensuring to include full citations for each.
