To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural dynamics under active inference" by Lancelot Da Costa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract and introduction** sections for any mention of datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but it may not specify datasets directly. The introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check for sections that describe the methodologies or experiments conducted, as these sections typically detail the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references that might list datasets.

If the paper includes an **experiments section**, I will examine it closely for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors may describe the datasets used for their simulations or analyses, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "the T-Maze task dataset," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as year and DOI.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all dataset citations are complete and accurate.
