To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Easy-to-use Instruction Processing Framework for Large Language Models" by Yixin Ou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of high-quality instruction datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setups. Here, they mention four instruction datasets used in their experiments:

1. **self_instruct_5k**: This dataset is constructed using the Self-Instruct method to distill instruction data from the text-davinci-003 model.

2. **alpaca_data_5k**: This dataset is randomly sampled from the Alpaca dataset, which is referenced in the paper.

3. **evol_instruct_5k**: This dataset is created using the Evol-Instruct method, which is another approach discussed in the paper.

4. **easyinstruct_5k**: This dataset is collected by integrating the three instruction datasets mentioned above and applying multiple selectors to extract high-quality instruction datasets.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Self-Instruct**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
