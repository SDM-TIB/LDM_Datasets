To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "An Auto-ML Framework Based on GBDT for Lifelong Learning" by Jinlong Chai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **five datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to identify.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using anonymous datasets in the NeurIPS Auto-ML competition. This suggests that the datasets are not named here, but it reinforces the idea that they are critical to the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset introduction)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. They refer to the datasets as **AA, B, C, D, and E**. Each dataset is described in terms of its features and size, which is essential information for understanding their context.

The paper provides a table (Table 1) that outlines the characteristics of each dataset, including the number of categorical features, numerical features, multi-value categorical features, time features, total size, and the time used versus the budget for each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets.

However, the datasets are referred to only by their labels (AA, B, C, D, E) without full citations or detailed descriptions. Since these datasets are part of a competition, I will need to check if there are any references or external sources that provide more information about these datasets.

I will consult the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide additional context or citations for the datasets. However, it appears that the references focus more on the methodologies and concepts rather than specific datasets.

Given that the datasets are labeled generically, I will note that the authors did not provide full citations for these datasets in the paper. Therefore, I will document the datasets as they are presented, while acknowledging the lack of detailed citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Dataset AA**: Contains 51 categorical features, 23 numerical features, 6 multi-value categorical features, and 2 time features. The total size is 10 million, with a time usage of 2821 seconds against a budget of 3600 seconds.

2. **Dataset B**: Contains 17 categorical features, 7 numerical features, 1 multi-value categorical feature, and 0 time features. The total size is 1.9 million, with a time usage of 216 seconds against a budget of 600 seconds.

3. **Dataset C**: Contains 44 categorical features, 20 numerical features, 9 multi-value categorical features, and 6 time features. The total size is 2 million, with a time usage of 717 seconds against a budget of 1200 seconds.

4. **Dataset D**: Contains 17 categorical features, 54 numerical features, 1 multi-value categorical feature, and 4 time features. The total size is 1.5 million, with a time usage of 567 seconds against a budget of 600 seconds.

5. **Dataset E**: Contains 25 categorical features, 6 numerical features, 1 multi-value categorical feature, and 2 time features. The total size is 17 million, with a time usage of 1633 seconds against a budget of 1800 seconds.

Since the datasets are part of a competition and are not publicly cited in the paper, I will note that full citations are not available. 

Finally, I will prepare to present this information in a structured format for further use or analysis.
