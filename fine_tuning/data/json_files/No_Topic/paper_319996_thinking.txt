To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DVFL: A Vertical Federated Learning Method for Dynamic Data" by Yuzhi Liang and Yixiang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental setup section (IV)**, the authors explicitly mention four benchmark datasets used in their experiments. I will list these datasets along with their descriptions:

1. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW)**: This dataset contains features that describe characteristics of cell nuclei from images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. It is noted to be imbalanced, with a positive to negative class ratio of approximately 2:8.

2. **Default of Credit Card Clients (DCC)**: This dataset includes information on credit card clients in Taiwan, collected from April 2005 to September 2005.

3. **Epsilon (ESP)**: This dataset consists of mock data and is used in the FATE framework. The authors mention a modified version called ESP5k.

4. **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**: This dataset was created from recordings of 30 participants performing daily activities, and it is available for public use.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW)**, the citation is:
  > K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian. "Robust linear programming discrimination of two linearly inseparable sets." *Optimization Methods & Software*, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 23–34, 1992.

- For **Default of Credit Card Clients (DCC)**, the citation is:
  > I. Yeh and C. Lien. "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients." *Expert Systems with Applications*, vol. 36, no. 2, pp. 2473–2480, 2009.

- For **Epsilon (ESP)**, the citation is:
  > The dataset is available at: https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE/blob/master/examples/data/README.md#epsilon_5k.

- For **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)**, the citation is:
  > A. Stisen et al. "Smart devices are different: Assessing and mitigating mobile sensing heterogeneities for activity recognition." In *Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems*, SenSys 2015, pp. 127–140, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
