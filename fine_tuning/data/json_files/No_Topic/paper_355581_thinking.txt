To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unifying Framework for Online Optimization with Long-Term Constraints" by Matteo Castiglioni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section may provide detailed information about the datasets, including their size, structure, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will note the citation as follows:
- Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Similarly, if they used another dataset, such as the **JHMDB Dataset**, I will find and record its citation:
- Haoqi Fan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards Understanding Action Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3192–3199, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
