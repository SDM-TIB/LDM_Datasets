To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Learning a Generic Agent for Vision-and-Language Navigation via Pre-training" by Weituo Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their performance on three VLN tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.4 (Pre-training Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for pre-training their model. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **R2R Dataset**: This dataset consists of 104,000 image-text-action triplets, which are crucial for training the model. It is specifically designed for the Room-to-Room navigation task.

2. **Matterport3D Dataset**: The authors utilize the Matterport3D Simulator to generate synthetic data, leading to a total of 6,482,000 image-text-action triplets for pre-training. This dataset is synthesized using a speaker model to create language instructions based on the agent's trajectory.

In the **experiments section**, the authors validate their model on three tasks: R2R, Cooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation (CVDN), and "Help, Anna!" (HANNA). I will check if these tasks have associated datasets mentioned in the paper.

For the **CVDN dataset**, the authors state that it comprises 2,050 human-human navigation dialogs and over 7,000 navigation trajectories across 83 MatterPort houses. This dataset is essential for evaluating the model's performance in a dialog-based navigation context.

For the **HANNA dataset**, the authors mention that it features 289 object types and a vocabulary of 2,332 words, which is used for interactive navigation tasks.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **R2R Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Matterport3D Dataset**, the citation is:

  > Nguyen, K., & Daumé III, H. (2019). Help, Anna! Visual navigation with natural multimodal assistance via retrospective curiosity-encouraging imitation learning. In *Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
