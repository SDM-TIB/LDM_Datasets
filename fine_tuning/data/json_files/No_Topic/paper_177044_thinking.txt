To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pop-up SLAM: Semantic Monocular Plane SLAM for Low-texture Environments" by Shichao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their algorithm on a public TUM dataset, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section (Section VI)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they tested their SLAM approaches on the **public TUM dataset** and two collected corridor datasets. I will need to gather details about these datasets.

In the experiments section, the authors mention using the **TUM fr3/structure notexture far dataset**. They describe it as a challenging environment composed of five white walls and a ground plane, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

The authors also refer to two **collected corridor datasets** but do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. I will note that while they are important for the experiments, I will need to clarify their details or find additional references if available.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TUM dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **TUM dataset**:
  > Jürgen Sturm, Nikolas Engelhard, Felix Endres, Wolfram Burgard, and Daniel Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), IEEE/RSJ International Conference on, pages 573–580, 2012.

Since the corridor datasets do not have specific citations in the paper, I will note that they are mentioned but lack formal references. If I were to continue this process, I would look for any supplementary materials or additional publications by the authors that might provide more information about these datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TUM dataset while noting the corridor datasets as mentioned but uncited. This will prepare me for creating structured outputs or further analysis.
