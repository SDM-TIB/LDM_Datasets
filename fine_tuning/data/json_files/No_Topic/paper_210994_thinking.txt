To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Triple Stream Three-dimensional CNN (STSTNet) for Micro-expression Recognition" by Sze-Teng Liong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on a composite database consisting of samples from three different databases: SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM. This suggests that these databases are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the significance of micro-expressions and mentions the use of these databases for recognition tasks, reinforcing their importance.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section III (Databases)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the three databases:

1. **SMIC (Spontaneous Micro-expression Database)**: This database consists of 164 samples captured at 100 fps, with a resolution of 170 × 140 pixels.

2. **CASME II (Chinese Academy of Sciences Micro-expression II Database)**: This database contains 145 samples captured at 200 fps, also with a resolution of 170 × 140 pixels.

3. **SAMM (Spontaneous Micro-expression Database)**: This database includes 133 samples, similarly captured at 200 fps and with a resolution of 170 × 140 pixels.

The authors also mention that these databases were merged into a composite database for their experiments, which consists of a total of 442 samples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **SMIC**:
  > X. Li, T. Pfiester, X. Huang, G. Zhao, and M. Pietikainen. *A spontaneous micro-expression database: Inducement, collection and baseline*. In IEEE FG, pages 1–6, April 2013.

- For **CASME II**:
  > W.-J. Yan, S.-J. Wang, G. Zhao, X. Li, Y.-J. Liu, Y.-H. Chen, and X. Fu. *CASME II: An improved spontaneous micro-expression database and the baseline evaluation*. PLoS ONE, 9:e86041, 2014.

- For **SAMM**:
  > A. K. Davison, C. Lansley, N. Costen, K. Tan, and M. H. Yap. *SAMM: A spontaneous micro-facial movement dataset*. IEEE Trans. on Aff. Computing, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
