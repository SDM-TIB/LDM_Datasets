To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cournot duopoly games with isoelastic demands and diseconomies of scale" by Xiaoliang Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, models, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for any references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various models of duopoly games but does not mention any specific datasets. I will continue to the **models section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the models being analyzed.

As I progress through the **models section**, I notice that the author describes different models (e.g., Model GR, Model GB, etc.) and their respective equations and equilibria. However, there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in this section either.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of other research papers that discuss theoretical models and findings related to duopoly games, but they do not indicate the use of specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in the research. The focus of the paper is on theoretical models and their analysis rather than empirical data derived from specific datasets.

Since no datasets were found, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets as none exist in this paper. My final step will be to summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not include any datasets for analysis or reference.
