To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Learning for Cognitive Digital Twins in Manufacturing Systems" by Trier Mortlock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of cognitive digital twins and graph learning, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section V (Use Case)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention generating a dataset by scraping **GrabCAD** for various categories of 3D CAD models. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

In this section, the authors specify the dataset details:
- The dataset consists of 6 different categories of 3D CAD models: **Car, Engine, Robotic Arm, Airplane, Gear, and Wheel**.
- The total number of models per category is provided, which is essential for understanding the dataset's scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to **GrabCAD** as the source of their dataset. The citation for GrabCAD is not provided in a traditional format, but I can reference it as follows:

- **GrabCAD**: GrabCAD is a platform that provides a large repository of CAD models, which can be accessed at [https://grabcad.com/](https://grabcad.com/).

Since the dataset is derived from a publicly available platform, I will note that the specific models and their attributes were extracted from this source.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for GrabCAD. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets referenced in the paper and their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
