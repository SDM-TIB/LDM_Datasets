To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-Based 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality-Assisted Assembly Guidance" by Shiyu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a synthetic dataset of publicly available and 3D printable assembly assets as a benchmark for future work. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology** and **evaluation** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe the generation of synthetic data for training and validation, which includes five 3D printing assembly assets sourced from Thingiverse. This is a crucial detail as it specifies the nature of the dataset.

In the **evaluation** section, the authors discuss the GBOT dataset, which consists of five assembly assets, each with multiple parts. They provide details about the training and test sets, including the number of images and conditions under which the data was collected (normal, dynamic light, motion blur, and hand occlusion). This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and intended use.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the following datasets:

1. **GBOT Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and includes five assembly assets. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shiyu Li, Hannah Schieber, Niklas Corell, Bernhard Egger, Julian Kreimeier, Daniel Roth. *Graph-Based 3D Object Tracking for Augmented Reality-Assisted Assembly Guidance*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, 2024.

2. **T-less Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the paper and is used for 6D pose estimation of texture-less objects. The citation is:
   > Hodan, P., Haluza, P., Obdrzalek, S., Matas, J., Lourakis, M., & Zabala, X. (2017). *T-LESS: An RGB-d dataset for 6d pose estimation of texture-less objects*. IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).

3. **BlenderProc**: This is a tool used for generating synthetic data, which is mentioned in the context of dataset generation. The citation is:
   > Denninger, M., Sundermeyer, M., Winkelbauer, D., Olefir, D., Hodan, P., Zidan, Y., Elbadrawy, M., Knauer, M., Katam, H., & Lodhi, A. (2020). *BlenderProc: Reducing the reality gap with photorealistic rendering*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or utilization of the data.
