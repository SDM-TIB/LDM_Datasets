To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Market Mergers with Common Customers: When (and Why) Do They Increase Negotiated Prices?" by Enrique Ide, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any **specific sections that discuss data** or empirical analysis, such as a "Data" or "Methodology" section. In this paper, the author may describe the datasets used for analysis, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

While reading, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names and descriptions. If the paper refers to datasets used in previous studies, I will ensure to capture those references as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Hospital Merger Dataset" or "Insurance Claims Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like this:
- "Dafny, Leemore, Kate Ho, and Robin S. Lee. *The Price Effects of Cross-Market Mergers: Theory and Evidence from the Hospital Industry*. The RAND Journal of Economics, 50(2): 286â€“325, 2019."

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation.
