To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fingerspelling PoseNet: Enhancing Fingerspelling Translation with Pose-Based Transformer Models" by Pooya Fayyazsanavi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate improvements on the **ChicagoFSWild** and **ChicagoFSWild+** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further context about these datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of fingerspelling translation and mentions the importance of datasets in training models, but it primarily reiterates the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.2) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they describe the **ChicagoFSWild** dataset as containing 7,304 ASL sequences from 160 signers and the **ChicagoFSWild+** dataset as containing 55,232 sequences from 260 signers. This section confirms the datasets used for their experiments and provides additional context about their composition.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ChicagoFSWild**, the citation is:
  > Bowen Shi, Aurora Martinez Del Rio, Jonathan Keane, Diane Brentari, Greg Shakhnarovich, and Karen Livescu. *American sign language fingerspelling recognition in the wild*. In 2018 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT), pages 145–152, IEEE, 2018.

- For **ChicagoFSWild+**, the citation is:
  > Bowen Shi, Aurora Martinez Del Rio, Jonathan Keane, Diane Brentari, Greg Shakhnarovich, and Karen Livescu. *Fingerspelling recognition in the wild with iterative visual attention*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5400–5409, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
