To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ordered Surprises and Conditional Probability Systems" by Adam Dominiak, Matthew Kovach, and Gerelt Tserenjigmid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses the theoretical framework and does not seem to reference any empirical datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **related literature section** and **model section** for any references to datasets used in previous studies or examples that might indicate the use of datasets. However, this paper appears to focus more on theoretical constructs rather than empirical data.

I will also check the **experiments or results section** (if present) for any mention of datasets used to validate the proposed models. In this case, the paper does not seem to include empirical experiments or datasets, as it primarily discusses theoretical implications and models.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. However, the references mainly consist of theoretical papers and do not point to specific datasets.

Since this paper does not provide any datasets or empirical data, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to gather their names, descriptions, and full citations from the references section to provide a comprehensive overview.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
