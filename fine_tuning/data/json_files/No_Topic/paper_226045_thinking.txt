To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning: a Comparison of UCB Versus Alternative Adaptive Policies" by Wesley Cowan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on comparing different reinforcement learning policies, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided about them.

In this paper, the authors describe a simulation involving a small example with 3 states and 2 actions, but they do not explicitly name any external datasets. Instead, they create a hypothetical scenario to illustrate their methods. Therefore, I will not find any datasets to cite from external sources.

Since no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will not need to look for citations in the references section. However, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **No external datasets were used** in the experiments; the authors created a simulated environment for their analysis.

Now, I will compile my findings into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly state the absence of datasets and provide a summary of the experimental setup as described in the paper. This will be useful for anyone reviewing the paper to understand the context of the experiments conducted.
