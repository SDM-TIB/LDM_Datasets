To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TAMUNA: Doubly Accelerated Federated Learning with Local Training, Compression, and Partial Participation" by Laurent Condat et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the TAMUNA algorithm and its features but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about federated learning but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to see if any datasets are used for testing the proposed algorithm. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on a logistic regression problem using two datasets: **w8a** and **real-sim**. 

1. **w8a Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as having 300 features and 1000 samples. It is sourced from the LIBSVM library, which is a well-known repository for datasets used in machine learning.

2. **real-sim Dataset**: This dataset has 20,958 features and is also used in the experiments. Like w8a, it is part of the LIBSVM library.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the LIBSVM library, which provides the necessary information for both datasets:

- For **w8a**, the citation is:
  > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines. *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology*, 2(27), 1-27. Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.

- For **real-sim**, the citation is the same as for w8a since it is also part of the LIBSVM library.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper.
