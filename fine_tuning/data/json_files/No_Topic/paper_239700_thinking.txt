To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cylindrical Convolutional Networks for Joint Object Detection and Viewpoint Estimation" by Sunghun Joung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the effectiveness of cylindrical convolutional networks (CCNs) on joint object detection and viewpoint estimation, which suggests that datasets are likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of viewpoint estimation and the need for datasets that provide accurate annotations. This section may provide hints about the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they evaluated their method on the **Pascal 3D+ dataset** and the **KITTI dataset**. 

1. **Pascal 3D+ Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from the Pascal VOC 2012 and a subset from ImageNet, annotated with viewpoint information for 12 different categories. The authors note that the bottle category is omitted due to symmetry issues.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,481 training images and 7,518 test images, annotated with observation angles and 2D locations, specifically focusing on the car object category.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Pascal 3D+ dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu Xiang, Roozbeh Mottaghi, and Silvio Savarese. *Beyond Pascal: A Benchmark for 3D Object Detection in the Wild*. In IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 75–82, 2014.

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are We Ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
