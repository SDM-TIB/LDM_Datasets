To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel SEPIC- Â´Cuk Based High Gain Solar Micro-Inverter for Grid Integration" by Arup Ratan Paul, Arghyadip Bhattacharya, and Kishore Chatterjee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might hint at datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experimental sections**. These sections typically describe the experiments conducted and may explicitly mention datasets used for simulations or validations. I will look for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that provide numerical data or experimental results.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to simulation parameters or experimental data that could be considered datasets. For example, the paper includes a **Table I** that lists simulation parameters, which may not be a dataset in the traditional sense but could be relevant for understanding the context of the experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the full citation for each dataset mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. If the paper refers to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset used for validation, I will note it down along with its citation. If the authors created their own dataset, I will describe it and provide the citation for the paper itself.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
