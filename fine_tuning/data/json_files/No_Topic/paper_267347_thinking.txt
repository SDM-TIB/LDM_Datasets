To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantitative assessment of increasing complexity" by L.P. Csernai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if the authors mention any datasets or data sources that are relevant to their study. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **results** sections, as these parts typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted and the data used. I will look for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that the authors utilized for their analyses. For instance, in this paper, there are tables that present thermodynamic parameters and entropy values for various materials, which may imply the use of underlying datasets.

I will also pay close attention to any **tables** or **figures** that summarize data, as these often indicate the datasets used in the research. For example, Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper provide thermodynamic parameters and entropy evaluations for different materials, which suggest that the authors compiled data from various sources.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the same data. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original sources.

For example, if the paper references the entropy values for water or other materials, I will look for the original studies or datasets that provided these values. If the authors conducted their own experiments, I will document the details of those experiments as a dataset.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the research paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
