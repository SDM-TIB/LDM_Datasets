To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotion Carrier Recognition from Personal Narratives" by Aniruddha Tammewar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract introduces the concept of Emotion Carrier Recognition (ECR) and mentions the use of a corpus of Personal Narratives (PNs) that are manually annotated. This indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention using a corpus of Spoken PNs that are annotated with emotion carriers. Specifically, they refer to the **Ulm State-of-Mind in Speech (USoMs) corpus**, which is crucial for my extraction.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of participants, the nature of the narratives collected, and the annotation process. They state that the dataset consists of PNs collected from 100 participants, with 239 PNs annotated for emotion carriers by four annotators. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the USoMs dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided in the paper is:

> E.-M. Rathner, Y. Terhorst, N. Cummins, B. Schuller, and H. Baumeister. *State of mind: Classification through self-reported affect and word use in speech.* Proc. Interspeech 2018, pp. 267â€“271, 2018.

Since the authors used this dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation. This will allow for a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
