To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning of Audio Representations from Permutations with Differentiable Ranking" by Andrew N Carr et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses self-supervised learning and mentions improving classification performance, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various pretext tasks and mention the importance of self-supervised learning in different applications. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **NSynth dataset**. They describe it as containing about 300,000 audio samples of musical notes, each with unique pitch, timbre, and envelope recorded from 1,006 different instruments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **methods section** for any additional datasets or details about how the NSynth dataset is processed. The authors provide information on how they use the dataset for downstream classification tasks, which further confirms its relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSynth dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Engel, J., Resnick, C., Roberts, A., Dieleman, S., Eck, D., Simonyan, K., & Norouzi, M. (2017). Neural audio synthesis of musical notes with wavenet autoencoders.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **NSynth Dataset**: Contains approximately 300,000 audio samples of musical notes, recorded from 1,006 different instruments, used for tasks such as instrument classification and pitch estimation.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.
