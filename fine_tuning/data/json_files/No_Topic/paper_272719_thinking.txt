To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affine Term-Structure Models: A Time-Changed Approach with Perfect Fit to Market Curves" by Cheikh Mbaye and Frédéric Vrins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets directly, such as **results, experiments, or applications**. In this paper, the authors may describe datasets used for calibration or validation of their models, particularly in the context of financial instruments like credit default swaps or interest rate models.

I will pay close attention to any **tables or figures** that may present data, as these often summarize key datasets. If the authors mention any datasets explicitly, I will note their names and any relevant details, such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "CDS term-structure of Ford Inc." and provide a reference to a Bloomberg report, I will note that down. The citation might look something like this:
> Bloomberg. *CDS Term-Structure of Ford Inc.* November 12, 2018.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.
