To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-the-grid: Fast and Effective Hyperparameter Search for Kernel Clustering" by Bruno Ordozgoiti and Lluís A. Belanche Muñoz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 7 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they employ a variety of publicly available synthetic and real datasets, and they provide a summary of the dataset characteristics in **Table 1**. This table is crucial as it lists the datasets along with their respective characteristics.

From **Table 1**, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Aggr. Dataset**: Contains 312 rows, 7 columns, and 6 classes.
2. **Compound Dataset**: Contains 775 rows, 31 columns, and 2 classes.
3. **D31 Dataset**: Contains 358 rows, 2 columns, and 2 classes.
4. **Flame Dataset**: Contains 569 rows, 2 columns, and 2 classes.
5. **Jain Dataset**: Contains 2000 rows, 3 columns, and 2 classes.
6. **Pathbased Dataset**: Contains 178 rows, 15 columns, and 2 classes.
7. **Spiral Dataset**: Contains 300 rows, 600 columns, and 2 classes.
8. **Audit Dataset**: Contains 240 rows, 3 columns, and 2 classes.
9. **Derma. Dataset**: Contains 373 rows, 10 columns, and 2 classes.
10. **WDBC Dataset**: Contains 569 rows, 30 columns, and 2 classes.
11. **WiFi Dataset**: Contains 2000 rows, 7 columns, and 4 classes.
12. **Wine Dataset**: Contains 178 rows, 13 columns, and 10 classes.
13. **MNIST Dataset**: Sampled versions with sizes of 1k, 2k, 4k, and 8k.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are publicly available, so I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets.

For example, the MNIST dataset citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that I accurately document the source of each dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets along with their citations in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
