To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph DNA: Deep Neighborhood Aware Graph Encoding for Collaborative Filtering" by Liwei Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their methodology and the experiments conducted, which typically include the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide details about the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will extract this information carefully to ensure I capture all necessary details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets such as:

1. **Douban Dataset**: A dataset containing user ratings and interactions, which is commonly used in collaborative filtering research.
2. **Flixster Dataset**: Another popular dataset for evaluating recommendation systems, particularly in the context of movie ratings.

I will ensure to document the full citations for these datasets as follows:

- For the **Douban Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). *Social computing data repository at ASU*. Retrieved from http://socialcomputing.asu.edu.

- For the **Flixster Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ma, H., Zhou, D., Liu, C., Lyu, M. R., & King, I. (2011). *Recommender systems with social regularization*. In Proceedings of the fourth ACM international conference on Web search and data mining (pp. 287-296). ACM.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.
