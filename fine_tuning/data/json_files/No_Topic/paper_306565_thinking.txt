To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Explicit Neural View Synthesis" by Pengsheng Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a method for novel view synthesis and highlights the efficiency of their approach. However, it does not specify any datasets. I will look for any references to datasets in the introduction, where the authors might discuss previous work or datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a large-scale dataset containing 3D models across various categories, which is crucial for training their model. 

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **DTU MVS dataset** for evaluating their model's performance in real-world scenarios. I will note the details provided about this dataset, which includes its focus on multi-view stereo images.

I will again refer to the references section to find the full citation for the DTU dataset. The citation is:
> Rasmus Jensen, Anders Dahl, George Vogiatzis, Engin Tola, and Henrik Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 406–413, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 3D models across various categories.
   - Citation: Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

2. **DTU MVS Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating multi-view stereo images.
   - Citation: Rasmus Jensen, Anders Dahl, George Vogiatzis, Engin Tola, and Henrik Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 406–413, 2014.

Now, I will prepare to format these datasets according to the specified structure for further processing.
