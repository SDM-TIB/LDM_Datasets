To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Batch Tournament Selection for Genetic Programming" by VinÃ­cius V. de Melo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted tests on several regression datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Data sets)**, where the authors provide a table listing the datasets used in their experiments. This section is crucial as it contains the names and descriptions of the datasets, including the number of variables, training cases, and test cases.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Airfoil**: 
   - Variables: 5
   - Training cases: 1202
   - Test cases: 301

2. **Concrete**: 
   - Variables: 8
   - Training cases: 824
   - Test cases: 206

3. **Energy Cooling**: 
   - Variables: 8
   - Training cases: 614
   - Test cases: 154

4. **Energy Heating**: 
   - Variables: 8
   - Training cases: 614
   - Test cases: 154

5. **Tower Data**: 
   - Variables: 25
   - Training cases: 3999
   - Test cases: 1000

6. **Wine Red**: 
   - Variables: 11
   - Training cases: 1279
   - Test cases: 320

7. **Wine White**: 
   - Variables: 11
   - Training cases: 3918
   - Test cases: 980

8. **Yacht**: 
   - Variables: 6
   - Training cases: 614
   - Test cases: 154

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are commonly known datasets in the field of machine learning and symbolic regression.

To ensure proper attribution, I will reference the original sources for these datasets where applicable:

- **Airfoil**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Concrete**: 
  > The dataset is widely used in regression tasks, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Energy Cooling**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Energy Heating**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Tower Data**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Wine Red**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Wine White**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

- **Yacht**: 
  > The dataset is commonly referenced in various studies, but specific citation details are not provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to note that while specific citations are not provided, these datasets are well-known in the research community. This will help maintain academic integrity and provide context for future readers or researchers interested in these datasets.
