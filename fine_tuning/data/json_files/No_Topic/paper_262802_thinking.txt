To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher order hesitant fuzzy Choquet integral operator and its application to multiple criteria decision making" by B. Farhadinia, U. Aickelin, and H.A. Khorshidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** in detail, as it often contains information about the datasets used for experiments or analyses. I will look for specific names of datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or the context in which they were used.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check there as well, as authors often discuss the datasets used to validate their findings. This section may provide additional context or confirm the datasets mentioned earlier.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Higher Order Hesitant Fuzzy Decision Matrix," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I will ensure to provide the original source citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required output format, ensuring that all information is clear and correctly attributed.
