To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Facial Expression Retargeting from Human to Avatar Made Easy" by Juyong Zhang, Keyu Chen, and Jianmin Zheng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section (4.1)**, where the authors describe how they obtained rig models for three characters: Mery, Chubby, and Conan. They mention generating 2000 valid expressions for each avatar character, which indicates that there is a dataset of avatar expressions created through sampling rigging parameters.

In the **experiments section (6.1)**, the authors refer to the **FaceWarehouse dataset** as the source of human expressions used for training their model. This dataset is crucial for understanding how the authors trained their variational autoencoder for human expression embedding.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section**:

1. **FaceWarehouse Dataset**:
   > Cao, C., Weng, Y., Zhou, S., Tong, Y., & Zhou, K. (2013). FaceWarehouse: A 3D facial expression database for visual computing. *IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics*, 20(3), 413-425.

2. **Avatar Expression Dataset**: The paper does not provide a formal citation for the generated avatar expressions, as they are created by the authors' methodology. However, I can summarize that the dataset consists of 2000 expressions generated for each of the three characters (Mery, Chubby, and Conan) through a sampling process.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
