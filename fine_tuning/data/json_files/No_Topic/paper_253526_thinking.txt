To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Real-time Robot-based Auxiliary System for Risk Evaluation of COVID-19 Infection" by Wenqi Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the system and its functionalities, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, which is explicitly dedicated to describing the dataset used in the study. Here, the authors detail the data collection process, the number of speech recording segments, and the demographics of the respondents. They mention that the dataset includes 1283 speech recording segments collected from 184 respondents, which is crucial information.

In this section, the authors also categorize the respondents into different groups based on their health status, which is important for understanding the dataset's composition. They provide specific numbers for each group, such as the number of COVID-19 infectors and control groups with various respiratory conditions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this paper, the dataset appears to be original and collected by the authors themselves, so there may not be external citations for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described as being collected from volunteers interacting with robots in community and hospital settings.

Since the dataset is original and not published elsewhere, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **COVID-19 Speech Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1283 speech recording segments collected from 184 respondents aged 6 to 80. It includes recordings from COVID-19 infectors and various control groups with respiratory conditions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate that the dataset is original and provide a brief description of its contents.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
