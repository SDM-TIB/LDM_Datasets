To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An AFDM-Based Integrated Sensing and Communications" by Yuanhan Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context of integrated sensing and communications but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will examine the **numerical simulations and analyses section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where datasets are often discussed in terms of simulation parameters or experimental results. I will look for any tables or figures that might indicate the use of specific datasets or simulation parameters that could be considered datasets.

In the **numerical simulations section**, I find **Table I**, which lists simulation parameters such as carrier frequency, number of subcarriers, and other relevant metrics. However, these parameters do not constitute datasets in the traditional sense (like labeled datasets used for training machine learning models).

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references include various papers, but they primarily focus on methodologies and theoretical frameworks rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that would require citation. The paper focuses on theoretical developments and simulations rather than empirical datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no dataset entries to create. However, if there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract their names, descriptions, and full citations from the references section to document them properly.

In summary, I will not create any dataset entries for this paper as no datasets were found. If datasets had been present, I would have followed the steps of identifying them in the relevant sections, extracting their details, and ensuring to provide full citations for each dataset as per the requirements.
