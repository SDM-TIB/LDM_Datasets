To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-based Convolutional De-Aliasing Network Learning for Parallel MR Imaging" by Yanxia Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that evaluations were conducted on an **in vivo brain dataset**, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention that the dataset was collected from a **3T scanner (SIEMENS MAGNETOM Trio Tim)** with a **12-channel head coil** and describes the scanning parameters, including TR, TE, and voxel resolution. They also specify that they randomly selected **80 images for training, 20 images for validation, and 50 images for testing**.

Now, I need to ensure that I have the full citation for this dataset. Since the dataset is described as an in vivo brain dataset collected using specific equipment, I will look for any references in the **References section** that might pertain to this dataset or similar datasets used in the context of MRI imaging.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific citations for the in vivo brain dataset mentioned in the experiments section. However, I can note that the dataset is likely derived from standard practices in MRI imaging, and the authors may not have provided a formal citation for it.

Given this, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **In Vivo Brain Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 images (80 for training, 20 for validation, and 50 for testing) collected from a 3T MRI scanner using a 12-channel head coil. The dataset is characterized by specific scanning parameters (TR = 2500ms, TE = 149ms, voxel resolution = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9mm).

Since there is no formal citation provided for this dataset in the paper, I will note that it is a common dataset used in the field of MRI research, but I will not be able to provide a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of a formal citation for the in vivo brain dataset.
