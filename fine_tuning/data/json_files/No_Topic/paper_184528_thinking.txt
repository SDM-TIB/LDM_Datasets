To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Matching Handwritten Document Images" by Praveen Krishnan and C.V. Jawahar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the problem of predicting similarity between handwritten document images, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, they mention the **HW-SYNTH dataset**, which is a synthetic dataset created to address the lack of training data for handwritten word images. The authors provide details about how this dataset was constructed, including the number of word images and the methods used to generate them.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **IAM dataset** and the **George Washington (GW) dataset** in the context of word spotting tasks. These datasets are commonly used in handwritten text recognition and are crucial for validating the proposed methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. For the **HW-SYNTH dataset**, since it is created by the authors, I will note it as:
   > Praveen Krishnan and C.V. Jawahar. *HW-SYNTH: A Synthetic Handwritten Dataset for Word Images*. (This citation is hypothetical as the dataset is not published in a separate paper).

2. For the **IAM dataset**, the citation is:
   > U. Marti and H. Bunke. *The IAM-database: an English sentence database for offline handwriting recognition*. IJDAR, 2002.

3. For the **George Washington (GW) dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Almazán, A. Gordo, A. Fornés, and E. Valveny. *Word spotting and recognition with embedded attributes*. PAMI, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
