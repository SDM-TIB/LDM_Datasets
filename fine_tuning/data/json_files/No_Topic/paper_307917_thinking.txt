To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Restless Bandits with Many Arms" by Xiangyu Zhang and Peter I. Frazier, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation or testing of their methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics that indicate their size or structure.

In this paper, the authors discuss various applications and examples, such as **crowdsourced labeling** and **dynamic assortment optimization**, which may imply the use of datasets related to these applications. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used in these contexts.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the **Penn Action Dataset** or any other specific dataset, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the context in which it was used and any relevant details provided by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key statistics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
