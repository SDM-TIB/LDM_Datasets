To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FusedLSTM at ACMMM-2018 CBVRP Challenge: Fusing frame-level and video-level features for Content-based Video Relevance Prediction" by Yash Bhalgat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods used, but the **data section** is likely where the datasets will be explicitly described.

In **section 2 (Data)**, the author mentions that the challenge provided pre-extracted features of videos, which indicates that there are datasets involved. The author specifies two types of features used in the experiments:

1. **Inception-pool3 features**: These are derived from the Inception network, specifically from the Pool-3 layer.
2. **C3D features**: These are obtained from a trained 3D convolutional neural network.

The author also describes the distribution of the datasets for two tracks: TV-shows and movie trailers. The details provided include:

- **Movies**: 
  - Training set: 4,500 movies
  - Validation set: over 1,000 movies
  - Testing set: 4,500 movies

- **Shows**: 
  - Training set: 3,000 shows
  - Validation set: over 800 shows
  - Testing set: 3,000 shows

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references a baseline paper for the challenge, which is crucial for citation purposes. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in the challenge:
  > Mengyi Liu, Xiaohui Xie, and Hanning Zhou. *Content-based Video Relevance Prediction Challenge: Data, Protocol, and Baseline*. Dataset available from https://github.com/mengyi-liu/cbvrp-acmmm-2018 (2018).

This citation is essential as it provides the source of the datasets used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Movies Dataset**: Contains 4,500 training movies, over 1,000 validation movies, and 4,500 testing movies.
2. **Shows Dataset**: Contains 3,000 training shows, over 800 validation shows, and 3,000 testing shows.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details and citations for clarity and completeness.
