To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CertViT: Certified Robustness of Pre-Trained Vision Transformers" by Kavya Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they perform experiments on several datasets, specifically **MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet**. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them, such as their input sizes, number of classes, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

3. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

4. **TinyImageNet Dataset**:
   > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. [https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/](https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/)

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
