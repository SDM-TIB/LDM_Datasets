To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PyramidBox++: High Performance Detector for Finding Tiny Face" by Zhihang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors highlight the importance of the **WIDER FACE dataset** as a main benchmark for face detection, indicating that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to gather more details about the dataset. In section 4.2, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the **WIDER FACE dataset**, stating that it consists of 393,703 annotated face bounding boxes across 32,203 images, with variations in pose, scale, expression, occlusion, and lighting conditions. They also mention how the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets, which is essential information for understanding its structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the WIDER FACE dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Shuo Yang, Ping Luo, Chen-Change Loy, and Xiaoou Tang. *WIDER FACE: A Face Detection Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Since the WIDER FACE dataset is the only dataset mentioned in this paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the WIDER FACE dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
