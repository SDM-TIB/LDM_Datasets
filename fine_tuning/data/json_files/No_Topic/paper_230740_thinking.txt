To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphX-Convolution for Point Cloud Deformation in 2D-to-3D Conversion" by Anh-Duc Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of 3D reconstruction from 2D images and mention the need for effective datasets. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors mention that they trained and evaluated their model on the **ShapeNet dataset**. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I will need to gather more details about it.

The paper states that they used a subset of the ShapeNet core, which consists of around 50,000 models categorized into 13 major groups. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **ShapeNet**:
  > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, and Hao Su. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Since this is the primary dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
