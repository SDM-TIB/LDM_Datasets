To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Sampling Strategy for Evaluation of Spectral-spatial Methods in Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Jie Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Spectral-Spatial Processing in Hyperspectral Image Classification)**, where the authors discuss various datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets and any relevant details about them.

In **section VI (A Controlled Random Sampling Strategy)**, the authors may also mention datasets used to validate their proposed sampling strategy. I will pay attention to any figures or tables that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention five commonly used hyperspectral datasets:

1. **Botswana Dataset**: A hyperspectral dataset used for land cover classification.
2. **Indian Pines Dataset**: Another widely used dataset in hyperspectral image classification.
3. **Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Dataset**: A dataset that includes hyperspectral images for classification tasks.
4. **Pavia University Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced for its application in hyperspectral classification.
5. **Salinas Scene Dataset**: A dataset used for evaluating classification methods in hyperspectral imagery.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
