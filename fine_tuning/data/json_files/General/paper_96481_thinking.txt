To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Role of Regularization in Shaping Weight and Node Pruning Dependency and Dynamics" by Yael Ben-Guigui et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for reducing the capacity of deep neural networks and mention various classification models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for these models.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the implementation and results. Here, the authors describe the models and tasks they applied their pruning methods to, which often includes the datasets used.

From the text, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Used for classifying handwritten digits with the MLP-300-100 model. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Utilized for the VGG-like model, which is a standard dataset for image classification tasks.

3. **ISBI 2012 Segmentation Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for the U-Net model, specifically for cell segmentation tasks.

4. **COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset is used with the DarkCovidNet model for automatic COVID-19 detection.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For the **ISBI 2012 Segmentation Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > I. Arganda-Carreras et al. *Crowdsourcing the creation of image segmentation algorithms for connectomics*. Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2015.

- For the **COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, J.P., Morrison, P., Dao, L. *COVID-19 Image Data Collection*. 2020. Available at: https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
