To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DepthP+P: Metric Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation using Planar and Parallax" by Sadra Safadoust and Fatma GÃ¼ney, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on the **KITTI driving dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they use the **Eigen split of the KITTI dataset** for training and evaluation. They mention the number of training and validation samples, which provides additional context about the dataset's use.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **KITTI Dataset**:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors use the Eigen split of the KITTI dataset for training and evaluation, which includes 45,000 training samples and 1,769 validation samples.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is accurately recorded, as it is essential for proper attribution in research contexts.
