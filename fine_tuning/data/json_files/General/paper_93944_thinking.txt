To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIPGAN - Generating Strong and High Quality Morphing Attacks Using Identity Prior Driven GAN" by Haoyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset called the **MIPGAN Face Morph Dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the **MIPGAN Face Morph Dataset**, which consists of 1270 bona fide images and 2500 morphed images generated using face images from the **FRGC-V2 face database**. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of images and the source of the images.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **FRGC-V2 face database**. The citation is as follows:
> P. J. Phillips, P. J. Flynn, T. Scruggs, K. W. Bowyer, Jin Chang, K. Hoffman, J. Marques, Jaesik Min, and W. Worek. *Overview of the face recognition grand challenge*. In 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’05), June 2005, pp. 947–954 vol. 1.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses the use of three types of data for experiments: digital images, re-digitized images (printed and scanned), and compressed images after re-digitization. However, these are not datasets in themselves but rather methods of processing the images from the main dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **MIPGAN Face Morph Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1270 bona fide images and 2500 morphed images generated using the FRGC-V2 face database.
   - Citation for FRGC-V2:

In 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR’05), June 2005, pp. 947–954 vol. 1.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
