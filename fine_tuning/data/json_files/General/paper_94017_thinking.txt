To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TANHSOFT - A FAMILY OF ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS COMBINING TANH AND SOFTPLUS" by Koushik Biswas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions improvements in classification accuracy on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, particularly where the authors discuss their findings related to the performance of their proposed activation functions. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST** datasets for testing their activation functions.

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The authors state that they conducted experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors also mention the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (28x28 grayscale). This dataset is a standard benchmark in the field of machine learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
