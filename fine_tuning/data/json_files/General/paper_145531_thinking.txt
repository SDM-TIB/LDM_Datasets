To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R2AG: Incorporating Retrieval Information into Retrieval Augmented Generation" by Fuda Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across five datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is developed from Google Search and contains questions paired with human-annotated answers extracted from Wikipedia. The authors refer to three versions of this dataset: NQ-10, NQ-20, and NQ-30.

2. **HotpotQA**: A well-known multi-hop question answering dataset based on Wikipedia, which requires reasoning over multiple supporting facts.

3. **MuSiQue**: A dataset designed for multi-hop questions that involve various reasoning chains.

4. **2WikiMultiHopQA (2Wiki)**: This dataset consists of multi-hop questions and is used to evaluate interpretability with supporting evidence.

5. **DuReader**: A Chinese dataset developed based on Baidu Search, adapted for assessing long context ability.

I will then gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
