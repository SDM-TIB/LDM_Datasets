To extract datasets from the research paper titled "eDiff-I: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with an Ensemble of Expert Denoisers" by Yogesh Balaji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors trained their model on a collection of public and proprietary datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this case, they mention using the **MS-COCO** and **Visual Genome** datasets for evaluation, which is a crucial detail.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. The authors state that they applied heavy filtering using a pretrained CLIP model to ensure high-quality training data, resulting in a final dataset containing about one billion text-image pairs. However, they specifically mention using **MS-COCO** and **Visual Genome** for evaluation purposes, which confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MS-COCO**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. **Visual Genome**:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A. Shamma, Michael Bernstein, and Li Fei-Fei. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123:32–73, 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MS-COCO**: A large-scale dataset containing images with annotations for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.
- **Visual Genome**: A dataset that provides dense annotations of images, including object relationships and attributes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
