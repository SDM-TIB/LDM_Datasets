To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Text Classification via Contrastive Adversarial Training" by Lin Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on several GLUE benchmark tasks and three intent classification datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the tables that summarize dataset statistics. In **Table 1**, the authors list several datasets used for the GLUE benchmark, including:

1. **MNLI**: A dataset for textual entailment with 393k training examples and 29 average length.
2. **QQP**: A dataset for question paraphrase with 364k training examples and 21 average length.
3. **QNLI**: A dataset for question answering/textual entailment with 105k training examples and 35 average length.
4. **MRPC**: A dataset for paraphrase detection with 3.8k training examples and 38 average length.
5. **RTE**: A dataset for textual entailment with 2.5k training examples and 51 average length.
6. **CoLA**: A dataset for grammatical correctness with 8.5k training examples and 8 average length.
7. **SST-2**: A dataset for sentiment analysis with 67k training examples and 9 average length.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide details about three intent classification datasets:

1. **CLINC**: Covers 150 intents in 10 domains with 17,999 training examples.
2. **BANKING**: Contains customer service queries in the banking domain with 10,003 training examples.
3. **HWU**: Covers 64 intents in 21 domains with 9,957 training examples.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the GLUE datasets are typically found in the original papers that introduced them. For example:

For the intent classification datasets, I will also look for their respective citations:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
