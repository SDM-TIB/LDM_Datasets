To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ST-CoNAL: Consistency-Based Acquisition Criterion Using Temporal Self-Ensemble for Active Learning" by Jae Soon Baik, In Young Yoon, and Jun Won Choi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method was evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using four public datasets for their experiments: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Caltech-256**, and **Tiny ImageNet**. I will note down these datasets and their descriptions as provided in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about each dataset:
1. **CIFAR-10**: Contains 50,000 training examples across 10 categories.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Contains 50,000 training examples across 100 categories.
3. **Caltech-256**: Contains 24,660 training examples across 256 categories.
4. **Tiny ImageNet**: Contains 100,000 training examples across 200 categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

- For **Caltech-256**:
  > Griffin, G., Holub, A., & Perona, P. (2007). *Caltech-256 object category dataset*. California Institute of Technology.

- For **Tiny ImageNet**:
  > Le, Y., & Yang, X. (2015). *Tiny ImageNet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N 7(7), 3.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
