To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JOINEDTrans: Prior Guided Multi-task Transformer for Joint Optic Disc/Cup Segmentation and Fovea Detection" by Huaqing He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three publicly available fundus image datasets: **GAMMA**, **REFUGE**, and **PALM**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this case, the authors explicitly list the datasets in the **experiments section**. They provide a brief description of each dataset, including the number of images and any relevant details about the dataset's purpose or characteristics.

1. **GAMMA Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the GAMMA challenge organizers in the MICCAI2021 OMIA8 workshop. It contains 200 fundus images collected from various types of equipment, with diverse image resolutions ranging from 1956 × 1934 to 2992 × 2000.

2. **REFUGE Dataset**: This dataset is part of the MICCAI2019 challenge and consists of 400 images for training, 400 for validation, and 400 for testing. The training data resolution is 2124 × 2056, while the validation and testing data resolution is 1634 × 1634.

3. **PALM Dataset**: Provided by the ISBI2019 Pathologic Myopia Ophthalmology Competition organizers, this dataset includes 800 training images and 400 testing images, with image resolutions of either 1444 × 1444 or 2124 × 2056. Notably, there is no ground truth segmentation for the optic cup (OC) in this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **GAMMA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Wu et al., "GAMMA Challenge: Glaucoma grading from Multi-Modality images," arXiv preprint arXiv: 2202.06511, 2022.

- For the **REFUGE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Orlando et al., "Refuge challenge: A unified framework for evaluating automated methods for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs," Medical Image Analysis, vol. 59, p. 101570, 2020.

- For the **PALM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISBI2019 Pathologic Myopia Ophthalmology Competition organizers, "PALM dataset," 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
