To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experiments with a PCCoder extension" by Mircea-Dan Hernest, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the synthesis of programs using neural networks and mentions the use of a training set, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the author describes the implementation details. This section often contains specific references to datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the paper, the author specifically mentions the use of the **MNIST dataset** for classification tasks. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and how it is utilized in the experiments. The MNIST dataset is described as containing 8x8 images of digits, which are used as input for the program synthesis tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is typically attributed to the original authors who created it, which is:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the MNIST dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation and any relevant details about how the dataset was used in the context of the research.

After completing these steps, I will be ready to present the dataset information in a structured format for further processing or review.
