To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Projected Diffusion for Procedure Planning in Instructional Videos" by Hanlin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three datasets with different scales," which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. The introduction further elaborates on the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, but I need to find specific dataset names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the provided text, the authors explicitly mention evaluating their model on three instructional video datasets: **CrossTask**, **NIV**, and **COIN**. 

1. **CrossTask**: This dataset contains 2,750 videos from 18 different tasks, with an average of 7.6 actions per video.
2. **NIV**: This dataset consists of 150 videos about 5 daily tasks, with an average of 9.5 actions per video.
3. **COIN**: This is a larger dataset with 11,827 videos covering 180 different tasks and an average of 3.6 actions per video.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **CrossTask**, the citation is:
  > Zhukov, D., Alayrac, J.-B., Gokberk Cinbis, R., Fouhey, D. F., Laptev, I., & Sivic, J. (2019). Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3537–3545.

- For **NIV**, the citation is:
  > Alayrac, J.-B., Bojanowski, P., Agrawal, N., Sivic, J., Laptev, I., & Lacoste-Julien, S. (2016). Unsupervised learning from narrated instruction videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 4575–4583.

- For **COIN**, the citation is:
  > Tang, Y., Ding, D., Rao, Y., Zheng, Y., Zhang, D., Zhao, L., Lu, J., & Zhou, J. (2019). COIN: A large-scale dataset for comprehensive instructional video analysis. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1207–1216.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
