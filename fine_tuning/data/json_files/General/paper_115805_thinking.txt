To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning ASR Pathways: A Sparse Multilingual ASR Model" by Mu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on multiple languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training. In this section, they state that they used data from the **MLS dataset** for four languages: English, French, Italian, and Dutch. This indicates that the MLS dataset is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will then look for more details about the MLS dataset in the text. The authors mention the sizes of the training audio for each language: 44.7k hours for English, 1.1k hours for French, 0.2k hours for Italian, and 1.6k hours for Dutch. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MLS dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MLS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vineel Pratap, Qiantong Xu, Anuroop Sriram, Gabriel Synnaeve, et al. *MLS: A large-scale multilingual dataset for speech research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.03411, 2020.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
