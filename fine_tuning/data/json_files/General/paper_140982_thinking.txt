To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subequivariant Reinforcement Learning Framework for Coordinated Motion Control" by Haoyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of CoordiGraph and mentions extensive experimentation with sophisticated agents in diverse environments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using multiple agents from **MuJoCo**, specifically listing environments such as **Hopper-v2, Humanoid-v2, HalfCheetah-v2, Centipede-v1, and Walker2d-v2**. This indicates that these environments are datasets or benchmarks used for their experiments.

I will then look for any specific references to datasets in the **related work** or **methodology sections**. In the methodology, they describe the state and action spaces but do not explicitly mention additional datasets beyond the MuJoCo environments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the MuJoCo environments. The relevant citation for MuJoCo is:

- **MuJoCo**: 
  > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MuJoCo environments for their experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MuJoCo dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
