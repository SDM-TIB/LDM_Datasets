To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep ReLU Networks Have Surprisingly Few Activation Patterns" by Boris Hanin and David Rolnick, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for empirical validation or theoretical analysis. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments conducted. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all information is clear and accessible for future use or analysis.
