To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization Framework Considering Input Uncertainty" by Jixiang Qing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical investigation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework through **numerical benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical investigation section** (section 4), where the authors discuss various benchmark functions used for testing their framework. Here, they mention several synthetic functions that are likely used as datasets for their experiments. I will carefully note the names and descriptions of these functions.

In **Table 2**, the authors list the synthetic benchmark functions along with their settings and input distributions. The functions mentioned include:

1. **VLMOP2**: A bi-objective synthetic problem with specific characteristics.
2. **SinLinForrester**: A bi-objective problem combining sine and Forrester functions.
3. **MDTP2**: A modified version of a test problem from previous literature.
4. **MDTP3**: Another modified version of a test problem.
5. **BraninGMM**: A bi-objective problem involving the Branin function and Gaussian Mixture Model.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, since these are synthetic functions created for the purpose of this study, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets.

For the synthetic functions, I will provide a description of each along with the relevant citations from the references section that discuss their origins or methodologies:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
