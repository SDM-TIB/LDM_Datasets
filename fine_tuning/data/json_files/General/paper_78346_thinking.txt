To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FASTER CNNS WITH DIRECT SPARSE CONVOLUTIONS AND GUIDED PRUNING" by Jongsoo Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used for training or evaluation. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. I will look for subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset** for training their models. They describe it as a large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 Dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further use or processing.
