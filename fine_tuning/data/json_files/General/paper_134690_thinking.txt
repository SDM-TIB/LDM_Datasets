To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DONUT-hole: DONUT Sparsification by Harnessing Knowledge and Optimizing Learning Efficiency" by Azhar Shaikh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the methods section.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for both pre-training and fine-tuning their models. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

In this section, the authors mention:

1. **Synthdog-EN Dataset**: This dataset is used for the pre-training phase and consists of 500,000 training images and 500 validation images generated using the Synthetic Document Generator (SynthDoG) library. They also mention generating additional images to compensate for the absence of a test set.

2. **CORD-V2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for fine-tuning and consists of 1,000 English receipt images, split into training, validation, and test sets (800, 100, and 100 images, respectively).

3. **Parcel Reader Dataset**: Another dataset used for fine-tuning, containing 1,388 images with customs information, split into training, validation, and test sets (1,109, 139, and 140 images, respectively).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Synthdog-EN Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **CORD-V2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kim, G., Hong, T., Yim, M., Nam, J., Park, J., Yim, J., Hwang, W., Yun, S., Han, D., & Park, S. (2022).

In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 36, pages 10767â€“10775.

- For **Parcel Reader Dataset**, since it is a commercial dataset collected by Prime Vision, it may not have a formal citation in the references, but I will note it as a dataset used in the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
