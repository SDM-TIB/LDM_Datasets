To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AGFormer: Efficient Graph Representation with Anchor-Graph Transformer" by Bo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of proposed AGFormer." This indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on five datasets: **NCI1, NCI109, MUTAG, COLLAB, and IMDB-BINARY**. I will take note of these names and look for additional details about each dataset, such as their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

The authors provide a summary of the datasets in a table (Table 1), which includes the number of graphs, average nodes, average edges, maximum nodes, and classes for each dataset. This information is crucial for describing the datasets comprehensively.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically provided for the datasets mentioned in the experiments. Here are the citations I will look for:

1. **NCI1 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > N. Wale, I. A. Watson, and G. Karypis. "Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification." *Knowledge and Information Systems*, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 347–375, 2008.

2. **NCI109 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > N. Wale, I. A. Watson, and G. Karypis. "Comparison of descriptor spaces for chemical compound retrieval and classification." *Knowledge and Information Systems*, vol. 14, no. 3, pp. 347–375, 2008.

3. **MUTAG Dataset**: The citation is:
   > N. Kriege and P. Mutzel. "Subgraph matching kernels for attributed graphs." In *Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning*, pp. 291–298, 2012.

4. **COLLAB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > J. Leskovec, J. Kleinberg, and C. Faloutsos. "Graphs over time: densification laws, shrinking diameters and possible explanations." In *Proceedings of the eleventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery in data mining*, pp. 177–187, 2005.

5. **IMDB-BINARY Dataset**: The citation is:
   > P. Yanardag and S. Vishwanathan. "Deep graph kernels." In *Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining*, pp. 1365–1374, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its characteristics and accompanied by the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
