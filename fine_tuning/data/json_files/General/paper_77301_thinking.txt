To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Past Mistakes: Improving Automatic Speech Recognition Output via Noisy-Clean Phrase Context Modeling" by Prashanth Gurunath Shivakumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **Fisher English Training Corpus**: This dataset is described as a collection of conversational telephone speech, consisting of 5850 speech samples and approximately 900 hours of speech data. It is used for training and evaluation.

2. **TED-LIUM Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing under mismatched training conditions. It consists of 207 hours of TED talks and is noted for its larger vocabulary size compared to the Fisher dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **Fisher English Training Corpus**:
  > Cieri, C., Miller, D., & Walker, K. (2004). The Fisher Corpus: a resource for the next generations of speech-to-text. In International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC).

- For the **TED-LIUM Dataset**:
  > Rousseau, A., Deléglise, P., & Estève, Y. (2014). Enhancing the TED-LIUM corpus with selected data for language modeling and more TED talks. In International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
