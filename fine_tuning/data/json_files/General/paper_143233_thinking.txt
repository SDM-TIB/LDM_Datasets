To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "MAML MOT: Multiple Object Tracking based on Meta-Learning" by Jiayi Chen and Chunhua Deng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges in multi-object tracking and mentions that experimental results are obtained from mainstream datasets in the MOT Challenge, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section III (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MOT16**: This dataset contains 7 training sequences and test sequences, with 5316 images in the training set and 5919 images in the test set. It includes 112K bounding boxes and 0.5K IDs for training.

2. **MOT17**: This dataset has the same sequences as MOT16 but provides pedestrian detection results from three public detectors, allowing for a fair comparison in public competitions. It also includes updated annotations.

3. **MOT20**: This dataset consists of 8 video segments from three different scenes, with 8931 frames in the training set and 4479 frames in the test set. It includes videos with higher crowd density and significant occlusions.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MOT16**, the citation is:
  > Milan, A., Leal-Taixé, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., and Schindler, K. (2016). *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

- For **MOT17**, the citation is:
  > Dendorfer, P., Rezatofighi, H., Milan, A., Shi, J., Cremers, D., Reid, I., Roth, S., Schindler, K., and Leal-Taixé, L. (2020). *MOT20: A benchmark for multi-object tracking in crowded scenes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.09003.

- For **MOT20**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same benchmark series.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
