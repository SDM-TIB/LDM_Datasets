To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuraNet: Multi-task Floor Plan Recognition with Relation Attention" by Lingxiao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CubiCasa5k public dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3.2 (Model Training)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training their model. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **CubiCasa5k**: This dataset is highlighted as the primary dataset used in their experiments, consisting of 5000 ground-truth Finnish floor plan images annotated using the SVG vector graphics format.

2. **CVC-FP**: This dataset includes 122 high-resolution images in four different drawing styles, with varying resolutions.

3. **R2V**: This dataset consists of 870 ground-truth floor plan images of urban residences collected from various regions in Japan.

4. **R3D**: This dataset contains 214 original images, with most room shapes being irregular and having nonuniform wall thickness.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CubiCasa5k**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented correctly for future reference or analysis.
