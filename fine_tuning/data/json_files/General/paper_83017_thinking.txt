To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Fast Algorithm for Cosine Transform Based Tensor Singular Value Decomposition" by Wen-Hao Xu, Xi-Le Zhao, and Michael Ng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments"** or **"Datasets"**. In this paper, the authors discuss numerical examples and experiments, which may include datasets used for testing their proposed methods.

I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or provide details about their characteristics. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, sizes, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "CAVE database" for multispectral images or "Penn Action Dataset" for video completion, I will ensure to find the complete citation for these datasets. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
