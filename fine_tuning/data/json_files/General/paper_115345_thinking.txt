To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Spatial and Tonal Data Optimisation for Homogeneous Diffusion Inpainting" by Pascal Peter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract discusses the optimization of pixel positions and values for inpainting, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using a subset of **100,000 images randomly sampled from ImageNet** for training and a validation dataset containing **1,000 images**. This indicates that ImageNet is a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Miami, FL, pp. 248–255.

Additionally, the paper mentions using the **BSDS500 database** for testing, which is another dataset I need to document. I will look for its citation in the references section as well. The citation for the BSDS500 dataset is:
> Arbelaez, P., Maire, M., Fowlkes, C., & Malik, J. (2011). *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(5), 898–916.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **ImageNet**: Used for training and validation.
   - Citation: Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Miami, FL, pp. 248–255.
   
2. **BSDS500**: Used for testing.
   - Citation: Arbelaez, P., Maire, M., Fowlkes, C., & Malik, J. (2011). *Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33(5), 898–916.

With this information, I am now ready to present the dataset entries in the required format.
