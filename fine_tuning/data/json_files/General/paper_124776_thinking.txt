To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EPVT: Environment-aware Prompt Vision Transformer for Domain Generalization in Skin Lesion Recognition" by Siyuan Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "four out-of-distribution datasets and six different biased ISIC datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ISIC2019 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training, validation, and testing. The authors specify the number of images in each split: 12,360 for training, 2,057 for validation, and 6,199 for testing.

2. **Derm7pt-Dermoscopic Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 872 images.

3. **Derm7pt-Clinical Dataset**: This dataset is also used for testing and contains 839 images.

4. **PAD-UFES-20 Dataset**: Another testing dataset with 531 images.

5. **PH2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 200 images.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be extracted as follows:

- For **ISIC2019 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Combalia, M., Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Carrera, C., Dusza, S., Gutman, D., Helba, B., Kittler, H., Kurtansky, N.R., Liopyris, K., et al. "Validation of artificial intelligence prediction models for skin cancer diagnosis using dermoscopy images: the 2019 international skin imaging collaboration grand challenge." *The Lancet Digital Health* 4(5), e330–e339, 2022.

- For **Derm7pt-Dermoscopic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kawahara, J., Daneshvar, S., Argenziano, G., Hamarneh, G. "Seven-point checklist and skin lesion classification using multitask multimodal neural nets." *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics* 23(2), 538–546, 2018.

- For **Derm7pt-Clinical Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Derm7pt-Dermoscopic Dataset since they are part of the same study.

- For **PAD-UFES-20 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pacheco, A.G., Lima, G.R., Salomao, A.S., Krohling, B., Biral, I.P., de Angelo, G.G., Alves Jr, F.C., Esgario, J.G., Simora, A.C., Castro, P.B., et al. "PAD-UFES-20: A skin lesion dataset composed of patient data and clinical images collected from smartphones." *Data in Brief* 32, 106221, 2020.

- For **PH2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mendonça, T., Celebi, M., Mendonca, T., Marques, J. "PH2: A public database for the analysis of dermoscopic images." *Dermoscopy Image Analysis*, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
