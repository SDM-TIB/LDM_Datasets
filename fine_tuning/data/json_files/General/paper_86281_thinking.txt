To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Detect Opinion Snippet for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis" by Mengting Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction provides context on the task and references previous works, which may lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention using datasets from SemEval 2014 and SemEval 2015 tasks, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be listed.

In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they use the Laptops and Restaurants datasets from SemEval 2014 and SemEval 2015. I will note the details provided, including the number of instances and the tasks (aspect-term and aspect-category sentiment classification).

The datasets mentioned are:
1. **Laptops Dataset**: This dataset is used for aspect-term level sentiment classification and includes training, development, and test splits.
2. **Restaurants Dataset**: This dataset is used for both aspect-term and aspect-category level sentiment classification, also with training, development, and test splits.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the SemEval tasks are as follows:

- For the **SemEval 2014 Task 4** dataset:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27–35, 2014.

- For the **SemEval 2015 Task 12** dataset:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, Haris Papageorgiou, Suresh Manandhar, and Ion Androutsopoulos. *SemEval-2015 Task 12: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2015), pages 427–434, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Laptops Dataset**: Used for aspect-term level sentiment classification.
   - Citation: Pontiki et al. (2014).

2. **Restaurants Dataset**: Used for both aspect-term and aspect-category level sentiment classification.
   - Citation: Pontiki et al. (2015).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
