To extract datasets from the research paper titled "âˆž-former: Infinite Memory Transformer" by Pedro Henrique Martins et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on a synthetic sorting task, language modeling, and document grounded dialogue generation, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the tasks they conducted. In **Section 4.1 (Sorting)**, they mention using a synthetic dataset for sorting tasks, but I need to check if they provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. 

In **Section 4.2 (Language Modeling)**, they mention fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on two datasets: **Wikitext-103** and a subset of **PG-19**. I will note these datasets and look for their full citations in the references section.

In **Section 4.3 (Document Grounded Dialogue)**, they refer to the **CMU Document Grounded Conversation dataset (CMU-DoG)**, which is another dataset I need to extract and cite.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Wikitext-103**:
   > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

2. **PG-19**:
   > Rae, J. W., Potapenko, A., Jayakumar, S. M., Hillier, C., & Lillicrap, T. P. (2019). *Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

3. **CMU Document Grounded Conversation dataset (CMU-DoG)**:
   > Zhou, K., Prabhumoye, S., & Black, A. W. (2018). *A Dataset for Document Grounded Conversations*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

After gathering this information, I will summarize each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
