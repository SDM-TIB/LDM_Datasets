To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DS-Agent: Automated Data Science by Empowering Large Language Models with Case-Based Reasoning" by Siyuan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of Kaggle as a resource for data science tasks. They mention collecting expert insights and solutions from Kaggle competitions, which suggests that datasets from these competitions may be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of specific datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments across various data science tasks, and they likely reference the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Airline Reviews Dataset**: This dataset is used for a regression task where the goal is to predict ratings based on customer feedback. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle.

2. **Electricity Dataset**: This dataset is used for time series forecasting, and it is also sourced from Kaggle.

3. **Wild Blueberry Yield Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of time series forecasting.

4. **Enzyme-Substrate Dataset**: This dataset is used for regression tasks and is sourced from Kaggle.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Airline Reviews Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Airline Reviews Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airline-reviews

For the **Electricity Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Electricity Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/electricity

For the **Wild Blueberry Yield Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Wild Blueberry Yield Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wild-blueberry-yield

For the **Enzyme-Substrate Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle. *Enzyme-Substrate Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enzyme-substrate

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and attributed.
