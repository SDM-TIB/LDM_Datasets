To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating Manifold Neighborhood Size for Nonlinear Analysis of LIBS Amino Acid Spectra" by Piyush K. Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on LIBS spectra for amino acids, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to these compounds.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention analyzing four amino acids (Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Cysteine, and D-Serine), polysaccharide (Ficoll), and a control group (water). This indicates that the study involves multiple datasets corresponding to these compounds.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors state that their data consisted of a total of 670 instances, each representing a single LIBS spectrum produced from 13 different samples drawn from the six aforementioned compounds. They also mention that the spectral intensity at each wavelength is used as a feature, resulting in a dataset with 26,100 dimensions.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or references to the datasets used, particularly in relation to the analysis and classification results.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Amino Acid LIBS Spectra Dataset**: This dataset includes LIBS spectra for four amino acids (Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, Cysteine, D-Serine) and a polysaccharide (Ficoll), along with water as a control. The dataset consists of 670 instances, each representing a LIBS spectrum.

2. **Polysaccharide LIBS Spectra Dataset**: This dataset includes LIBS spectra specifically for the polysaccharide Ficoll, analyzed alongside the amino acids.

3. **Water LIBS Spectra Dataset**: This dataset includes LIBS spectra for water, serving as a control in the experiments.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own experiments, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the relevant references that support the methodologies used in the analysis.

The relevant references that may provide context for the datasets include:

- Miziolek, A., Palleschi, V., & Schechter, I. (2006). *Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy: Fundamentals and applications*. Cambridge University Press.
- Rehse, S. J., Salimnia, H., & Miziolek, A. W. (2012). Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS): an overview of recent progress and future potential for biomedical applications. *Journal of Medical Engineering and Technology*, 36, 77â€“89.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
