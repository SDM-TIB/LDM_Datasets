To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RS-DGC: Exploring Neighborhood Statistics for Dynamic Gradient Compression on Remote Sensing Image Interpretation" by Weiying Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving an accuracy improvement on the **NWPU-RESISC45 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section IV) for a detailed description of the datasets. In **Section IV-A (Data Description)**, the authors explicitly describe two datasets:

1. **UC Merced Land-Use Dataset (UCML-21)**: This dataset was released in October 2010 by the Computer Vision Laboratory at the University of California, Merced. It contains 21 categories of land-use scenes, with each category having 100 images of size 256 × 256 pixels.

2. **NWPU-RESISC45 Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale public dataset released by Northwestern Polytechnical University for scene classification of remote sensing images. It contains 45 categories, with 700 images per category, and each image is also 256 × 256 pixels.

Both datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, as they validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **UC Merced Land-Use Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., & Newsam, S. (2010). Bag-of-visual-words and spatial extensions for land-use classification. In Proceedings of the 18th SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems (pp. 270–279).

- For the **NWPU-RESISC45 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cheng, G., Han, J., & Lu, X. (2017). Remote sensing image scene classification: Benchmark and state of the art. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1865–1883. DOI: 10.1109/JPROC.2017.2675998.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
