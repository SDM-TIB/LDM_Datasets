To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Graph â€“ Deep Learning: A Case Study in Question Answering in Aviation Safety Domain" by Ankush Agarwal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data repositories sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed an Aviation Knowledge Graph from aircraft accident reports, which suggests that datasets related to these reports may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Repositories)**, where the authors describe multiple public repositories used in their research. They specifically mention:

1. **National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Reports**: These reports contain detailed information about civil aviation accidents in the US. The authors state that they used 4000 NTSB reports from 1962 to 2015 for constructing the Aviation Knowledge Graph.

2. **Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) Reports**: This dataset gathers information from pilots and crew members about close call events during flight journeys. The authors mention that this dataset is also relevant for their work.

3. **Airworthiness Directives (ADs)**: These are notifications issued by the FAA regarding unsafe conditions in specific aircraft models. The authors consider ADs in their study.

4. **Accident/Incident Data Reporting (ADREP) Taxonomy**: This dataset contains a complex multi-level hierarchy of factual descriptors and analytical descriptors related to aviation accidents, which is used for constructing the ontology.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

- For **NTSB Reports**, the citation is:
  > National Transportation Safety Board. *Aviation Accident Reports*. Available at: https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/AviationQuery.aspx.

- For **ASRS Reports**, the citation is:
  > Aviation Safety Reporting System. *ASRS Database*. Available at: https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/search/reportsets.html.

- For **Airworthiness Directives**, the citation is:
  > Federal Aviation Administration. *Airworthiness Directives*. Available at: https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/airworthiness_directives/.

- For **ADREP Taxonomy**, the citation is:
  > International Civil Aviation Organization. *ADREP Taxonomy*. Available at: https://www.icao.int/safety/airnavigation/aig/pages/adrep-taxonomies.aspx.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
