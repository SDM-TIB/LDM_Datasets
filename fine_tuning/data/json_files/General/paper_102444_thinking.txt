To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic and Static Object Detection Considering Fusion Regions and Point-wise Features" by Andrés E. Gómez H. et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors assess their proposal using a benchmark dataset and real-world data, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for various tasks in autonomous driving, including object detection. The authors state that they used the training and test images from KITTI to train their YoloV3 approach.

2. **KITTI MOD Dataset**: This dataset is specifically mentioned as necessary for recognizing the motion of objects based on the KITTI dataset. The authors note that it contains 5,997 static vehicles and 2,383 dynamic ones labeled.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. “Vision Meets Robotics: The KITTI Dataset.” *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, 2013.

- For the **KITTI MOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Siam, H. Mahgoub, M. Zahran, S. Yogamani, M. Jagersand, and A. El-Sallab. “MODNet: Motion and Appearance Based Moving Object Detection Network for Autonomous Driving.” In *2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)*, IEEE, 2018, pp. 2859–2864.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: Used for training and testing the YoloV3 approach.
   - Citation: A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. “Vision Meets Robotics: The KITTI Dataset.” *International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)*, 2013.

2. **KITTI MOD Dataset**: Used for recognizing the motion of objects.
   - Citation: M. Siam, H. Mahgoub, M. Zahran, S. Yogamani, M. Jagersand, and A. El-Sallab. “MODNet: Motion and Appearance Based Moving Object Detection Network for Autonomous Driving.” In *2018 21st International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)*, IEEE, 2018, pp. 2859–2864.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
