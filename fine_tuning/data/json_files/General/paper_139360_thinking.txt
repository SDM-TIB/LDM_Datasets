To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time 3D-aware Portrait Editing from a Single Image" by Qingyan Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the method and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **FFHQ dataset** for real faces, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's role in their experiments.

I will also check the **appendix (B Dataset)**, where the authors provide additional details about the dataset and samples used in their experiments. This section often contains valuable information about how the dataset was utilized and any modifications made.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the **FFHQ dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
- For **FFHQ dataset**:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401-4410.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured and formatted.
