To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Colorization using U-Net with Skip Connections and Fusion Layer on Landscape Images" by Muhammad Hisyam Zayd et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for specific types of images for colorization, which may indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors mention that their model is trained on a dataset consisting of landscape images. They state that they used **682,382 images for training, 13,700 images for validation, and 1,370 images for testing**, which suggests a large dataset is involved.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussion)**, the authors specify that the raw dataset is taken from **Place365**, which is a well-known dataset for scene understanding. They mention that this dataset contains **1,817,700 training images** and **3,650 testing images** across **365 classes**. This is a crucial piece of information that confirms the dataset used in their experiments.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Place365 dataset. The citation is typically provided in the format of the original paper or source from which the dataset is derived.

The citation for the Place365 dataset is:
> Aditya Khosla. *A Large-Scale Database for Scene Understanding*. Available at: http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Place365
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset for scene understanding containing 1,817,700 training images and 3,650 testing images across 365 classes.
   - **Citation**: Aditya Khosla. *A Large-Scale Database for Scene Understanding*. Available at: http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html.

With this information, I am ready to compile the dataset entry for further processing or review. I will ensure that the citation is accurately represented to maintain academic integrity.
