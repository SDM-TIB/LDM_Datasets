To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VAAD: Visual Attention Analysis Dashboard applied to e-Learning" by Miriam Navarro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, context and dataset, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the VAAD tool and mentions that it visualizes and analyzes eye movement data collected during learning sessions. This indicates that there is a dataset related to eye movement data.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Context and Dataset)**, where the authors describe the study conducted with 120 learners. They mention that the data was gathered during a learning session (LS) in an online course titled "Introduction to Development of Web Application" on the edX platform. This suggests that the dataset includes eye-tracking data and multimodal biometric data collected during the LS.

In this section, the authors specify the types of data collected:
1. **Eye-tracking Data**: This data is collected using the Tobii Pro Fusion eye-tracking device, which estimates various metrics related to eye movements, such as fixation and saccade events.
2. **M2LADS Data**: This dataset includes additional information about the learner population and the learning session, such as participant ID, activity identifier, timestamps, and learning scores.

I will now check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but it does reference the tools and platforms used to collect the data.

For the **Tobii Pro Fusion eye-tracking device**, I will look for the manufacturer's website or relevant publications that describe the device. The citation might look something like this:
> Tobii Pro. *Tobii Pro Fusion: Eye Tracker*. [Online]. Available: https://www.tobiipro.com/product-list/eye-trackers/tobii-pro-fusion/

For the **edBB platform**, I will also search for relevant publications or documentation that describe this platform. The citation could be:
> J. Hernandez-Ortega et al. “edBB: Biometrics and behavior for assessing remote education,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.04786, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
