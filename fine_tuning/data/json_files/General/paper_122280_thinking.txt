To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Writing Style Adaptation in Handwriting Recognition" by Jan Kohút et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the challenges in handwriting recognition and hints at the use of datasets for training models. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (CzechHWR Dataset)**, which is dedicated to describing the dataset used in the experiments. Here, the authors detail the composition of the **CzechHWR dataset**, which consists of triplets of text line images, writer style identifiers (WSI), and annotations. They mention that the dataset was created from three main sources, including an OCR web application and a collection of Czech letters, resulting in a total of 406k annotated text line images.

I will summarize the key details of the **CzechHWR dataset**:
- It contains 406k annotated text line images.
- It includes 5.1k unique writer style identifiers (WSI).
- The dataset is derived from various sources, including military diaries, letters, and chronicles.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference the sources from which the dataset was created, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. However, I can cite the paper as the source of the dataset:

- For the **CzechHWR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jan Kohút, Michal Hradiš, and Martin Kišš. *Towards Writing Style Adaptation in Handwriting Recognition*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the **CzechHWR dataset** is the primary dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.
