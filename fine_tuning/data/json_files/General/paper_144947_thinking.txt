To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are Large Language Models Actually Good at Text Style Transfer?" by Sourabrata Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating LLMs on sentiment transfer and text detoxification across three languages: English, Hindi, and Bengali. This indicates that datasets are likely involved, so I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 3.1 (Datasets & Tasks)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using datasets for sentiment transfer and text detoxification, specifically noting that each dataset comprises 1,000 style-parallel examples. 

The paper references two specific tasks:
1. **Sentiment Transfer**: The authors refer to datasets used for sentiment transfer tasks in English, Hindi, and Bengali. They cite previous works (Mukherjee et al., 2024b, 2023a) for these datasets, which I will need to look up for full citations.
   
2. **Text Detoxification**: The authors mention using an English and Hindi dataset for text detoxification, citing Mukherjee et al. (2023b) for this dataset.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for these datasets:
- For the sentiment transfer datasets, I will find the citations for Mukherjee et al. (2024b) and Mukherjee et al. (2023a).
- For the detoxification dataset, I will find the citation for Mukherjee et al. (2023b).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
