To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online False Discovery Rate Control for LORD & SAFFRON Under Positive, Local Dependence" by Aaron Fisher, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it discusses the methods and their applications. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments, so I will pay close attention to any mentions of data sources or datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is no specific section titled "Datasets," but the **experiments section** (which may be found in Section 5 or similar) is likely to contain information about the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets that are referenced.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the experiments section, I will check the **methodology** or **simulation** sections, as these often describe the data generation process or the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any references to specific datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Once I identify the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses a dataset like the "Simulated Normal Distribution" for its experiments, I will note the details about this dataset, including how it was generated and any relevant parameters. I will also ensure to provide the full citation for the source of this dataset if it is derived from another work.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
