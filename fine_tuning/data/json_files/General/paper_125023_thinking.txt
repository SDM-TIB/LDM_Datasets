To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deepfake Detection of Occluded Images" by Mahsa Soleimani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of new datasets for testing their approach, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they used. Here, they describe the datasets created for their experiments, including both real and fake images. They specifically mention the use of:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 202,599 face images of 10,177 unique celebrities, featuring significant variations in pose, background, and diversity.

2. **FFHQ Dataset**: The Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset contains 52,000 high-quality PNG images, each 512 × 512 pixels, showcasing a wide range of ages, ethnicities, and backgrounds, along with various accessories.

Additionally, the authors mention that fake images were generated using **StyleGAN**, **StyleGAN2**, **StarGAN**, and **PGGAN**, which were trained on the CelebA and FFHQ datasets. However, these are not datasets themselves but rather models used to generate images.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu et al. “Deep learning face attributes in the wild.” In: Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 3730–3738.

- For **FFHQ Dataset**:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. “A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks.” In: Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 4401–4410.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the representation of the datasets extracted from the paper.
