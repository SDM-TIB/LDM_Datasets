To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Parameter-Efficient Integration of Pre-Trained Language Models in Temporal Video Grounding" by Erica K. Shimomoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "three challenging datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **Charades-STA**: This dataset is built upon the Charades dataset (Sigurdsson et al., 2016) and includes time-based annotations for activity classes. The authors specify that it contains 12,408 training and 3,720 testing moment-query pairs, with average video lengths and moment durations.

2. **ActivityNet Captions**: Introduced by Krishna et al. (2017), this dataset consists of 20,000 YouTube videos with temporal localization and sentence descriptions. The authors provide details about the average length of videos and the number of localized intervals.

3. **YouCookII**: This dataset consists of 2,000 untrimmed cooking videos from YouTube, annotated with temporal boundaries for each cooking step, as described by Zhou et al. (2018). The authors mention average video lengths and moment statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Charades dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A. Sigurdsson, Gül Varol, Xiaolong Wang, Ali Farhadi, Ivan Laptev, and Abhinav Gupta. *Hollywood in Homes: Crowdsourcing Data Collection for Activity Understanding*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2016, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 510–526, Cham. Springer International Publishing, 2016.

- For **ActivityNet Captions**, the citation is:
  > Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-Captioning Events in Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 706–715, 2017.

- For **YouCookII**, the citation is:
  > Luowei Zhou, Nathan Louis, and Jason J. Corso. *Towards Automatic Learning of Procedures From Web Instructional Videos*. In Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

With the dataset names and their citations collected, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its name, description, and full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
