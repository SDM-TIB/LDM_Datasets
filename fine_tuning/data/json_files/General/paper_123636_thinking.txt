To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Xformer: Hybrid X-Shaped Transformer for Image Denoising" by Jiale Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world image denoising tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, they mention using several datasets for training and testing. Specifically, they list:

1. **Training Datasets**:
   - **DIV2K**: A dataset used for training, which is commonly used in image restoration tasks.
   - **Flickr2K**: Another dataset mentioned for training purposes.
   - **BSD500**: A dataset used for training.
   - **WED**: Also mentioned as part of the training data.

2. **Testing Datasets**:
   - **Set12**: A benchmark dataset for testing image denoising algorithms.
   - **BSD68**: Another benchmark dataset used for testing.
   - **Kodak24**: A dataset mentioned for testing purposes.
   - **McMaster**: A dataset used for testing.
   - **Urban100**: A high-resolution dataset used for testing.

In **section 4.4 (Real Image Denoising Results)**, the authors mention using:
- **SIDD**: A dataset for training their models for real image denoising.
- **DND**: A dataset used for evaluation, which does not provide ground-truth labels.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
