To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A knowledge graph representation learning approach to predict novel kinase-substrate interactions" by Sachin Gavali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a phosphoproteomic knowledge graph constructed from various data sources, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection titled **2.1 Data**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used to construct the knowledge graph:

1. **iPTMnet**: This dataset contains human post-translational modification (PTM) data, specifically focusing on phosphorylation events. The authors mention that it includes 26,411 phosphorylation PTM events, which are crucial for building the kinase-substrate interaction network.

2. **Protein Ontology (PRO)**: This dataset provides hierarchical relationships among proteins and protein complexes, which helps in constructing triples for the knowledge graph.

3. **Gene Ontology (GO)**: The authors utilize GO to create triples that describe biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular localizations associated with gene products.

4. **BioKG**: This is a knowledge graph that integrates various biological data, and the authors mention that they include specific relations such as protein-pathway associations and protein-disease associations.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For **iPTMnet**, the citation is:

Wu. *iPTMnet: an integrated resource for protein post-translational modification network discovery*. Nucleic Acids Research, 46(D1):D542–D550, Jan 2018.

Wu. *Protein ontology (PRO): enhancing and scaling up the representation of protein entities*. Nucleic Acids Research, 45(D1):D339–D346, Jan 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all datasets are properly documented and attributed. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
