To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partial Binarization of Neural Networks for Budget-Aware Efficient Learning" by Udbhav Bamba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image resized to 64x64 pixels. This dataset is also used for image classification.

3. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

4. **GOT-10K**: A dataset for object tracking, containing 10,000 high-resolution video sequences with various objects. It is used to evaluate the performance of tracking algorithms.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **GOT-10K**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., Wu, C., & Wang, X. *GOT-10K: A Large High-Quality Benchmark for Generic Object Tracking in the Wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.04550, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
