To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Surfel Fusion Using Normalised Information Distance" by Louis Gallagher and John B. McDonald, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **ICL-NUIM** and **TUM RGB-D** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets. In the **introduction**, the authors state that they report results from applying their technique to both the **ICL-NUIM** and **TUM RGB-D** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are central to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They mention using the **ICL-NUIM** synthetic living room dataset for quantitative evaluation and the **Dyson lab sequence** from the TUM RGB-D dataset for scalability testing. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ICL-NUIM dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Handa, T. Whelan, J.B. McDonald, and A.J. Davison. *A benchmark for RGB-D visual odometry, 3D reconstruction and SLAM*. In IEEE Intl. Conf. on Robotics and Automation, ICRA, May 2014.

2. For the **TUM RGB-D dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Sturm, N. Engelhard, F. Endres, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems (IROS), Oct. 2012.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **ICL-NUIM Dataset**: A synthetic living room dataset used for evaluating RGB-D visual odometry and SLAM algorithms.
- **TUM RGB-D Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for evaluating RGB-D SLAM systems, consisting of various sequences captured in indoor environments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
