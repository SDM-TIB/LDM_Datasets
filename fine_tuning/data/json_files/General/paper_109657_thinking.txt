To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Informational Autocrats, Diverse Societies" by A. Arda Gitmez and Pooya Molavi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the research and hint at the datasets used, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors reference specific datasets used for their analysis or empirical validation. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

I will also check the **appendices** if available, as they may contain supplementary information about the datasets, including data sources, collection methods, and any preprocessing steps taken.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to media freedom, public opinion, or political behavior, as these topics are likely to be central to the authors' analysis.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
