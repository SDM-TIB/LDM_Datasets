To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalised learning of time-series: Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes" by Mehmet SÃ¼zen and Alper Yegenoglu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the utility of the proposed method (reconstructive cross-validation) on simulated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this process.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology. In **section 3.1**, they mention generating an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for their experiments. This indicates that the authors created a synthetic dataset based on this process, which I need to document.

In **section 3.1**, the authors specify that they generated an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck time-series for 1000 regular time points with a specific mean and covariance structure. This is a clear indication of a dataset, albeit a synthetic one.

Now, I will look for any references or citations related to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in the **References section** to provide a full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a foundational text on stochastic processes, which is relevant for understanding the context of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

The citation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is:
> C. Gardiner. *Stochastic methods: a handbook for the natural and social sciences*. Springer, 4th edition, 2009.

Since the dataset is synthetic and generated based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, I will document it as follows:

1. **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process Dataset**: This dataset consists of time-series data generated from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, with 1000 time points and specific parameters for mean and covariance.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as it is the basis for the dataset used in the experiments. This will ensure that the dataset is well-documented and properly attributed.
