To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CaT-GNN: Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection via Causal Temporal Graph Neural Networks" by Yifan Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **YelpChi**: This dataset compiles hotel and restaurant reviews from Yelp, where nodes represent reviews and there are three types of relationship edges among these reviews.

2. **Amazon**: This dataset consists of reviews of products in the musical instruments category, with nodes representing users and edges indicating relationships among reviews.

3. **FFSD**: This is a private financial fraud semi-supervised dataset with partially labeled transaction records. The authors note that if a transaction is reported as fraudulent, it is labeled as 1; otherwise, it is labeled as 0.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the public datasets are:

- For **YelpChi**, the citation is:
  > Shebuti Rayana and Leman Akoglu. *Collective opinion spam detection: Bridging review networks and metadata*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 985–994, 2015.

- For **Amazon**, the citation is:
  > Julian John McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *From amateurs to connoisseurs: modeling the evolution of user expertise through online reviews*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web, pages 897–908, 2013.

Since FFSD is a private dataset, it may not have a formal citation available in the references, but I will note its description as provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the public datasets and a description for the private dataset. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
