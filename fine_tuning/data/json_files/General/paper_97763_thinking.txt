To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digital twins based on bidirectional LSTM and GAN for modelling the COVID-19 pandemic" by César Quilodrán-Casas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a SEIRS model and mentions that the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology in detail, including the use of a SEIRS model and the application of machine learning techniques. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are referenced in relation to the SEIRS model or the training of the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BDLSTM) network and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly name any datasets in a dedicated section. However, they mention that the model parameters are based on official virus spreading data from the UK. This indicates that there is a dataset being used, but I need to find the exact source or citation for this data.

I will check the **References section** to identify any citations that may correspond to the datasets used. The authors reference several studies and datasets related to COVID-19, including:

1. **COVID-19 infection data**: This is likely derived from public health sources or databases that track COVID-19 cases, but the specific dataset is not named in the paper. I will need to refer to the references to find the most relevant citation.

2. **SEIRS model data**: The authors mention that the SEIRS model parameters are based on observed data, but again, they do not specify a dataset. I will look for references that discuss the SEIRS model in the context of COVID-19.

After reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

- For the official COVID-19 data, the citation is:
  > Dong, E., Du, H., & Gardner, L. (2020). An interactive web-based dashboard to track COVID-19 in real time. *The Lancet Infectious Diseases*, 20(5), 533-534.

- For the SEIRS model and its application, the citation is:
  > R˘adulescu, A., Williams, C., & Cavanagh, K. (2020). Management strategies in a SEIR-type model of COVID 19 community spread. *Scientific Reports*, 10, 21256.

Now that I have identified the relevant citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:
1. **COVID-19 infection data** (source: Dong et al., 2020)
2. **SEIRS model parameters** (source: R˘adulescu et al., 2020)

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
