To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TOKEN2VEC: A Joint Self-Supervised Pre-Training Framework Using Unpaired Speech and Text" by Xianghu Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the token2vec framework and mentions experiments conducted on the **LibriSpeech dataset** and the **Fluent Speech Command (FSC) dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Details)**, where the authors provide specific information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 960 hours of training data from read audiobooks, with three subsets: train-clean-100, train-clean-360, and train-other-500. The authors clarify that the labels are not used during pre-training.

2. **Fluent Speech Command (FSC) Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the spoken intent classification task. The authors reference its use in the context of the SUPERB benchmark.

In addition to these datasets, I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **LibriSpeech dataset**, the citation is:
> Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

For the **Fluent Speech Command (FSC) dataset**, the citation is:
> Shu wen Yang, Po-Han Chi, Yung-Sung Chuang, and et al. *SUPERB: Speech processing universal performance benchmark*. In Proceedings of Interspeech, pages 1194–1198, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
