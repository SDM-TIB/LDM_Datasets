To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Calibration and Conformal Prediction of Deep Classifiers" by Lahav Dabah and Tom Tirer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses calibration and conformal prediction methods but does not specify datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used in the empirical studies.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. I will note down these datasets and look for any specific details about them, such as their characteristics or the context in which they were used.

Next, I will look at the **tables** presented in the results section, particularly Table 1, which provides information about the models and datasets used. It confirms that the experiments were conducted on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
