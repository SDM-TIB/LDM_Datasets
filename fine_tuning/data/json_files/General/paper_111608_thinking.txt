To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models are Few-Shot Clinical Information Extractors" by Monica Agrawal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce new datasets for benchmarking few-shot clinical information extraction based on a manual re-annotation of the CASI dataset. This indicates that the CASI dataset is a key dataset in this work.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **Methods section** is likely to contain information about the datasets, particularly in the subsection titled **Dataset Annotation**. Here, the authors describe how they created three new annotated datasets from the CASI dataset. 

1. **Clinical Acronym Sense Inventory (CASI)**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of 500 text examples for each of 75 acronyms, leading to a subset of 18,164 examples and 41 acronyms for evaluation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Moon, S., Pakhomov, S., Liu, N., O'Ryan, J., & Melton, G. B. (2014). A sense inventory for clinical abbreviations and acronyms created using clinical notes and medical dictionary resources. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 21(2), 299-307.

2. **MIMIC-III Critical Care Database**: The authors also mention using a reverse substitution dataset generated over the MIMIC-III database, which contains 8912 test examples over the same 41 acronyms as the CASI subset. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3, 160035.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors further confirm the use of these datasets for their experiments, which solidifies their importance in the study.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations for future reference.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset.
