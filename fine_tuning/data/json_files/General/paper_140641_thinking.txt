To extract datasets from the research paper titled "COVID-19 Detection from Pulmonary CT Scans Using a Novel EfficientNet with Attention Mechanism" by Ramy Farag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a deep learning model for COVID-19 detection from CT images, which suggests that datasets related to CT scans are likely involved. The introduction further emphasizes the need for automation in analyzing CT scans, hinting at the use of specific datasets for training and validation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to two datasets: **challenge1** and **challenge2** datasets, which were used for training and validation. However, I need to find more details about these datasets, including their origins and any relevant citations.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **COVID-19-CT-DB dataset** introduced by Dimitrios Kollias et al. This dataset is crucial for their work, as it provides labeled COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT images.

The full citation for the **COVID-19-CT-DB dataset** is:
> Dimitrios Kollias, Anastasios Arsenos, and Stefanos Kollias. *AI-enabled analysis of 3-D CT scans for diagnosis of COVID-19 & its severity*. In 2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops (ICASSPW), pages 1â€“5. IEEE, 2023.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using the validation set from **challenge1** for testing, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset. Therefore, I will focus on the **COVID-19-CT-DB dataset** as the primary dataset referenced in their work.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
