To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activate or Not: Learning Customized Activation" by Ningning Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions improvements in performance on various models, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed activation functions.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

Upon reviewing the experiments, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for image classification tasks. They report results on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset, which is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Additionally, the paper discusses performance improvements on the **COCO dataset** for object detection and the **CityScapes dataset** for semantic segmentation. I will also look for their citations in the references.

The citation for the COCO dataset is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

The citation for the CityScapes dataset is:
> Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
