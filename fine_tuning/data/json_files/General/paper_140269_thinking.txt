To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Object Throwing Behavior in Surveillance Videos" by Ivo P.C. Kersten et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a novel public dataset called the **Throwing Action dataset**, which consists of videos of throwing actions and normal behaviors. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or "Proposed Novel Dataset." In this paper, the relevant section is titled **Proposed Novel Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the **Throwing Action dataset** in detail, noting that it includes 271 videos of throwing actions and 130 normal videos. They also categorize the throwing actions based on the traffic participant (bicyclist, car driver, pedestrian) and whether the throw is dangerous or safe.

In addition to the **Throwing Action dataset**, the authors mention the **UCF-Crime dataset** as a benchmark for comparison in their experiments. This dataset is used alongside the Throwing Action dataset to evaluate the performance of their anomaly detection method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Throwing Action dataset**, since it is a novel dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
   > Kersten, I.P.C., Akdag, E., Bondarev, E., & de With, P.H.N. (2023). *Detection of Object Throwing Behavior in Surveillance Videos*. Eindhoven University of Technology. 

2. For the **UCF-Crime dataset**, the citation is:
   > Sultani, W., Chen, C., & Shah, M. (2018). *Real-World Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6479â€“6488. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Throwing Action dataset**: A novel dataset consisting of 271 videos of throwing actions and 130 normal videos, categorized by traffic participant and action type.
- **UCF-Crime dataset**: A publicly available dataset used for evaluating anomaly detection methods in surveillance videos.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
