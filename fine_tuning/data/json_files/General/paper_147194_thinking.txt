To extract datasets from the research paper titled "System-1.x: Learning to Balance Fast and Slow Planning with Language Models" by Swarnadeep Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention two planning tasks: **Maze Navigation** and **Blocksworld**. I will look for specific details about the datasets used for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Maze Navigation Dataset**: The authors mention that they generated a balanced dataset of 4,000 planning problems for maze navigation, specifying the configuration (5x5 maze, 40% obstacles, etc.) and the split for training, validation, and testing (3200/400/400).

2. **Blocksworld Dataset**: The authors describe generating problems consisting of 4-7 blocks, with a train/validation/test split of 3000/250/200 samples. They also mention that the training and validation sets consist of samples with plan lengths 1-6, while the test set consists of samples with plan lengths 7-10.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors and not sourced from external publications, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors and do not have formal citations.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details:

- For **Maze Navigation Dataset**, I will include:
  - Name: Maze Navigation Dataset
  - Description: A dataset of 4,000 planning problems generated for a 5x5 maze with 40% obstacles, split into training, validation, and test sets (3200/400/400).

- For **Blocksworld Dataset**, I will include:
  - Name: Blocksworld Dataset
  - Description: A dataset of planning problems consisting of 4-7 blocks, with a train/validation/test split of 3000/250/200 samples, where the training and validation sets consist of samples with plan lengths 1-6, and the test set consists of samples with plan lengths 7-10.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets as described in the paper, ready for structured output.
