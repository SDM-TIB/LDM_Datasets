To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Image Segmentation Using Squeeze-and-Expansion Transformers" by Shaohua Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were performed on various medical image segmentation tasks, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe three specific tasks: optic disc/cup segmentation, polyp segmentation, and brain tumor segmentation. Each of these tasks likely corresponds to a dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the datasets used for each task:

1. **REFUGE’20 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for optic disc/cup segmentation in fundus images. The authors mention that it includes 1200 training images and 400 validation images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Orlando, J. I., Fu, H., Barbosa Breda, J., van Keer, K., Bathula, D. R., & Diaz-Pinto, A. (2020). Refuge challenge: A unified framework for evaluating automated methods for glaucoma assessment from fundus photographs. *Medical Image Analysis*, 59, 2020.

2. **Drishti-GS Dataset**: This dataset is also used for optic disc/cup segmentation and contains additional images for training. The citation is:
   > Sivaswamy, J., Krishnadas, S., Chakravarty, A., Joshi, G., & Ujjwal. (2015). A comprehensive retinal image dataset for the assessment of glaucoma from the optic nerve head analysis. *JSM Biomedical Imaging Data Papers*, 2, 2015.

3. **RIM-ONE v3 Dataset**: Another dataset used for optic disc/cup segmentation, which is referenced in the paper. The citation is:
   > Fumero, F., Alayon, S., Sanchez, J. L., Sigut, J., & Gonzalez-Hernandez, M. (2011). RIM-ONE: An open retinal image database for optic nerve evaluation. In *24th International Symposium on CBMS*, 2011.

4. **CVC612 Dataset**: This dataset is used for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images, consisting of 612 images. The citation is:
   > Fan, D.-P., Ji, G.-P., Zhou, T., Chen, G., Fu, H., Shen, J., & Shao, L. (2020). PraNet: Parallel reverse attention network for polyp segmentation. In *MICCAI*, 2020.

5. **Kvasir Dataset**: Another dataset for polyp segmentation, containing 1000 images. The citation is:
   > Kvasir Dataset. (2020). Available at: https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir.

6. **BraTS’19 Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans, with 335 training scans and 125 validation scans. The citation is:
   > Bakas, S., Akbari, H., Sotiras, A., Bilello, M., Rozycki, M., Kirby, J. S., Farahani, K., & Davatzikos, C. (2017). Advancing The Cancer Genome Atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features. *Nature Scientific Data*, 4, 2017.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I compile this information accurately, as it is crucial for proper referencing and validation of the research findings. 

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review.
