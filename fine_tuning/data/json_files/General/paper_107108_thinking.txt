To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Generative Vision Transformer with Energy-Based Latent Space for Saliency Prediction" by Jing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions applying the proposed framework to both RGB and RGB-D salient object detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often included in research papers. In this paper, the **experimental results** section (specifically section 4.1) provides information about the datasets used for training and testing.

In section 4.1, the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **DUTS training set**: This dataset is used for training models in RGB salient object detection.
2. **DUTS testing set**: This dataset is used for testing the models in RGB salient object detection.
3. **ECSSD**: Another benchmark dataset for RGB salient object detection.
4. **DUT**: A dataset used for RGB salient object detection.
5. **HKU-IS**: A benchmark dataset for RGB salient object detection.
6. **PASCAL-S**: A dataset used for RGB salient object detection.
7. **NJU2K dataset**: This dataset is used for training models in RGB-D salient object detection.
8. **NLPR dataset**: Another dataset used for training models in RGB-D salient object detection.
9. **NJU2K testing set**: This dataset is used for testing RGB-D models.
10. **NLPR testing set**: This dataset is also used for testing RGB-D models.
11. **DES**: A dataset used for testing RGB-D salient object detection.
12. **SSB**: Another dataset used for testing RGB-D salient object detection.
13. **SIP**: A dataset used for testing RGB-D salient object detection.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I found:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
