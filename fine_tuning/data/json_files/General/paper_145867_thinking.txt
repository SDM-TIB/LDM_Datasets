To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphPipe: Improving Performance and Scalability of DNN Training with Graph Pipeline Parallelism" by Mengdi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on **three multi-branch DNNs**: Multi-Modal Transformer, DLRM, and CANDLE-Uno. I will check if these models are associated with specific datasets or if the authors refer to any publicly available datasets used for training or evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the **CANDLE-Uno**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is a well-known dataset, I will ensure to include the original source or paper that introduced it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
