To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Satellite Image Based Cross-view Localization for Autonomous Vehicle" by Shan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of satellite images for vehicle localization, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of existing localization techniques and hint at the datasets they will use. I will pay close attention to any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (IV)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they constructed for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **KITTI-CVL**: This dataset is constructed using ground-view images from the KITTI dataset and spatially consistent satellite images from Google Maps. The authors provide details about the resolution and the method of obtaining the satellite images.

2. **FordAV-CVL**: Similar to KITTI-CVL, this dataset is built from ground-view images from the Ford Multi-AV Seasonal dataset and their corresponding satellite images from Google Maps. The authors also mention the specific trajectory used for evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors validate their method using these two datasets, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 1231–1237, 2013.

- For the **Ford Multi-AV Seasonal dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Agarwal, A. Vora, G. Pandey, W. Williams, H. Kourous, and J. McBride. *Ford Multi-AV Seasonal Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 39, no. 12, pp. 1367–1376, 2020.

- For **Google Maps**, while the paper mentions it as a source for satellite images, it does not provide a formal citation. However, I can note that it is a widely used service for obtaining satellite imagery.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details or citations.
