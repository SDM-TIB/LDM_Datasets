To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DUETRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation" by Dian Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, while the introduction discusses the context and significance of the work. The evaluation section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments.

In the **evaluation section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. They state that their experiments were conducted based on the **HotpotQA dataset** and a collection of external knowledge from Wikipedia. This indicates that these are the primary datasets relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for a detailed description of the **HotpotQA dataset** within the same section. The authors describe it as an open-domain question-answering dataset based on Wikipedia, focusing on common knowledge across various domains. They also mention that they used the first 5,000 samples from the official training set and the first 1,000 samples from the validation set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HotpotQA dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Zhilin Yang, Peng Qi, Saizheng Zhang, Yoshua Bengio, William W Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Christopher D Manning. *HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.09600, 2018.

Since the authors also mention using external knowledge from Wikipedia, I will note that while Wikipedia itself is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it serves as a source of external knowledge for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the HotpotQA dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the use of the HotpotQA dataset and its details in the evaluation section.
3. Retrieve the full citation for the HotpotQA dataset from the references.
4. Prepare to document the dataset information clearly and accurately.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all necessary details for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
