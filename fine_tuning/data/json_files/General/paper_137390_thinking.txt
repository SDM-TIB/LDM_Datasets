To extract datasets from the research paper titled "QuantumSEA: In-Time Sparse Exploration for Noise Adaptive Quantum Circuits" by Tianlong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted with **7 Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 6 simulated or real quantum computers**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the benchmarks used. In this section, they mention specific datasets for QML tasks, including:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of clothing items, serving as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset.
3. **Vowel Dataset**: This dataset contains 990 samples used for classification tasks, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing.

I will also check the **related works and references sections** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278-2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*, 2017.

- For **Vowel Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. H. Deterding. "Speaker normalization for automatic speech recognition." Ph.D. dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1990.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their authoritative references.
