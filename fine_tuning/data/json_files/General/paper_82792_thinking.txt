To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining" by Guillaume Lample and Alexis Conneau, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of cross-lingual pretraining and mentions improvements on various benchmarks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation or training. In this paper, the authors refer to several benchmarks and datasets, including:

1. **XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for evaluating cross-lingual classification performance. It is mentioned in Section 4.1, where the authors describe how they fine-tune their models on this benchmark.

2. **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) datasets**: The authors mention using WMT’14 English-French, WMT’16 English-German, and WMT’16 Romanian-English for unsupervised and supervised machine translation tasks in Sections 4.2 and 4.3.

3. **MultiUN**: This dataset is referenced in Section 5.2 as a source of parallel data for training, specifically for languages like French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.

4. **IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the parallel data used for Hindi in Section 5.2.

5. **OPUS**: The authors refer to various corpora extracted from the OPUS website, including the EUbookshop corpus, OpenSubtitles 2018, Tanzil, and GlobalVoices, which are used for different language pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will need to extract include:

- For **XNLI**:
  > Conneau, A., Rinott, R., Lample, G., Williams, A., Bowman, S. R., Schwenk, H., & Stoyanov, V. (2018). XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.

- For **WMT datasets**:

- For **OPUS**:

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
