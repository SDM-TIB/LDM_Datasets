To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Machine Translation via Binary Code Prediction" by Yusuke Oda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on two English ↔ Japanese bidirectional translation tasks, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. In **section 4.1**, they provide details about the corpora used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **ASPEC Dataset**: This dataset is used for English-Japanese translation and contains 2.00 million training sentences, 1,790 development sentences, and 1,812 test sentences. The vocabulary size is 65,536.

2. **BTEC Dataset**: This dataset is also for English-Japanese translation and has 510,000 training sentences, 508 development sentences, and 250 test sentences. The vocabulary size is 25,000.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The ASPEC dataset is cited as follows:
- Nakazawa, T., Yaguchi, M., Uchimoto, K., Utiyama, M., Sumita, E., Kurohashi, S., & Isahara, H. (2016). ASPEC: Asian scientific paper excerpt corpus. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), pages 2204–2208.

The BTEC dataset is cited as:
- Takezawa, T. (1999). Building a bilingual travel conversation database for speech translation research. In Proc. of the 2nd International Workshop on East-Asian Resources and Evaluation Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 17–20.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
