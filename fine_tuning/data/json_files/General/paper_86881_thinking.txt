To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MonaLog: a Lightweight System for Natural Language Inference Based on Monotonicity" by Hai Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **SICK benchmark**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section 3 (MonaLog and SICK)**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they use the **SICK dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing around 10,000 English sentence pairs annotated for entailment, neutral, or contradiction relations.

In addition, the authors mention a **corrected version of the SICK dataset**, which was manually checked and corrected by previous researchers (Kalouli et al., 2017, 2018). This indicates that there are two versions of the SICK dataset being referenced.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **SICK Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Marelli, M., Menini, S., Baroni, M., Bentivogli, L., Bernardi, R., & Zamparelli, R. (2014). A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models. In Proceedings of LREC 2014.

2. **Corrected SICK Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Kalouli, A.-L., Buis, A., Real, L., Palmer, M., & dePaiva, V. (2017). Explaining simple natural language inference. In Proceedings of the 13th Linguistic Annotation Workshop, pages 132â€“143.
     > Kalouli, A.-L., Real, L., & dePaiva, V. (2018). Wordnet for easy textual inferences. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Miyazaki, Japan.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or analysis.
