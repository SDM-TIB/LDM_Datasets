To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis and Mortality Prediction using Multiclass Classification for Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes" by Ruchika Desure and Gutha Jaya Krishna, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a structured dataset with 68 potential mortality predictors for 275,190 diabetic U.S. military veterans aged 65 years or older. This suggests that a significant dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the dataset as being sourced from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and detail its characteristics, including the number of records and the types of variables included. This section will provide insights into the dataset's structure and its relevance to the study.

In the **results section**, the authors may reference the dataset again, particularly when discussing the performance of their models. They mention that the dataset includes various predictors related to demographics, comorbidities, and clinical biomarkers, which reinforces the importance of the dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** for full citations related to the dataset. The authors reference Griffith et al. (2020) for the dataset they used, which is crucial for providing proper attribution. The citation is as follows:
- Griffith, K.N., Prentice, J.C., Mohr, D.C., and Conlin, P.R. (2020). Predicting 5-and 10-year mortality risk in older adults with diabetes. *Diabetes Care*, 43(8), 1724-1731.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is publicly accessible through the Mendeley Data Repository, which is important for transparency and reproducibility. The citation for the dataset is:
- Griffith, K. (2021). A Novel Dataset of Predictors of Mortality for Older Veterans Living with Type II Diabetes - Mendeley Data. Available at: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/kn8v3678n9/3.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
