To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bottom-Up Grounding in the Probabilistic Logic Programming System Fusemate" by Peter Baumgartner and Elena Tartaglia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., size, number of instances, etc.).

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss **applications or examples**. The authors may describe specific scenarios or case studies that utilize datasets, which can provide additional context and details.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset mentioned as "Markov Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, Year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further processing. This systematic approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
