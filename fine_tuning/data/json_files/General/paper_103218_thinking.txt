To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling the Knowledge of Large-scale Generative Models into Retrieval Models for Efficient Open-domain Conversation" by Beomsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of using large-scale generative models and mention the need for efficient retrieval models. This suggests that datasets are likely involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on the **BST+ dataset**, which is a combination of four datasets: **Blended Skill Talk**, **ConvAI2**, **Empathetic Dialogues**, and **Wizard of Wikipedia**. This section will provide details about how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **methodology section** for any additional context about how the datasets were augmented or modified during the research. The authors describe a data-level augmentation process using a large-scale generative model, which indicates that the original datasets were expanded with generated responses.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather full citations for each of the datasets mentioned:

1. **Blended Skill Talk**:
   > Smith, E. M., Roller, S., Goyal, N., Dinan, E., & Weston, J. (2020). *Recipes for building an open-domain chatbot*. In Proceedings of the 16th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume (pp. 300-325).

2. **ConvAI2**:
   > Zhang, Y., Roller, S., Dinan, E., & Weston, J. (2018). *Personalizing dialogue agents: I have a dog, do you have pets too?* In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 2204-2213).

3. **Empathetic Dialogues**:
   > Rashkin, H., Smith, E. M., Li, M., & Boureau, Y.-L. (2019). *Towards empathetic open-domain conversation models: A new benchmark and dataset*. In Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (pp. 5370-5381).

4. **Wizard of Wikipedia**:
   > Dinan, E., Fan, A., Williams, A., Kiela, D., & Weston, J. (2018). *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
