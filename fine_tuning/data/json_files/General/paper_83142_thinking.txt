To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentional Encoder Network for Targeted Sentiment Classification" by Youwei Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SemEval 2014 Task 4 Dataset**: This dataset is composed of restaurant reviews and laptop reviews, labeled with three sentiment polarities: positive, neutral, and negative.

2. **ACL 14 Twitter Dataset**: This dataset is gathered from Twitter and is also labeled with the same three sentiment polarities.

3. **Additional Dataset**: The authors refer to the datasets as being labeled with three sentiment polarities, but they do not specify a third dataset in the text. I will note that only two datasets are explicitly named.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SemEval 2014 Task 4 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 27–35, 2014.

- For the **ACL 14 Twitter Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Svetlana Kiritchenko, Xiaodan Zhu, Colin Cherry, and Saif Mohammad. *NRC-Canada-2014: Detecting Aspects and Sentiment in Customer Reviews*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), pages 437–442, 2014.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
