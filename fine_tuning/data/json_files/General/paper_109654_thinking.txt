To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying Cyber-Risky Clinical Notes by Employing Natural Language Processing" by Suzanna Schmeelk et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **i2b2 de-identification dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data and Methods)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They specifically mention the **i2b2 de-identification dataset** and provide details about its structure, including the XML format and the types of sensitive information it contains. This section confirms that the i2b2 dataset is the primary dataset used in their analysis.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets in the **related work section** or throughout the paper. However, the focus seems to be primarily on the i2b2 dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the i2b2 dataset. The authors reference the i2b2 dataset in relation to previous works, particularly the one by Kumar et al. (2015), which discusses the creation of a new longitudinal corpus of clinical narratives based on the i2b2/UTHealth corpus.

The citation for the i2b2 dataset is:
> V. Kumar, A. Stubbs, S. Shaw, and Ö. Uzuner. "Creation of a new longitudinal corpus of clinical narratives." *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, vol. 58, pp. S6–S10, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the i2b2 dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
