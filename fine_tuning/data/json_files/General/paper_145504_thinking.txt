To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing Embedding Spectrum for Recommendation" by Shaowen Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that they implemented their methods on two popular recommender models and conducted experiments on three datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table III**, which lists the datasets used in their experiments along with relevant statistics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **CiteULike**: A scholarly article recommendation dataset with 5,551 users, 16,981 items, and 210,537 interactions, resulting in a density of 0.223%.
2. **Yelp**: A business dataset from the Yelp Challenge with 25,677 users, 25,815 items, and 731,672 interactions, with a density of 0.109%.
3. **Gowalla**: A check-in dataset with 29,858 users, 40,981 items, and 1,027,370 interactions, leading to a density of 0.084%.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

- For **CiteULike**, the citation is:
  > "CiteULike Dataset." Available at: https://github.com/js05212/citeulike-a

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > "Yelp Dataset Challenge." Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

- For **Gowalla**, the citation is:
  > "Gowalla Dataset." Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
