To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disease Knowledge Transfer across Neurodegenerative Diseases" by R˘azvan V. Marinescu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use a combined dataset from two distinct diseases, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **data acquisition and preprocessing** subsection. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **TADPOLE Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with various multimodal scans. It is crucial to note the specific details provided about the dataset, such as the number of subjects and types of scans included.

2. **Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the Dementia Research Centre (DRC) and includes MRI scans from patients diagnosed with PCA. The authors specify the number of subjects and the type of data available, which is essential for understanding the dataset's context.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TADPOLE Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marinescu, R.V., Oxtoby, N.P., Young, A.L., Bron, E.E., Toga, A.W., Weiner, M.W., Barkhof, F., Fox, N.C., Klein, S. and Alexander, D.C. (2018). *TADPOLE Challenge: Prediction of Longitudinal Evolution in Alzheimer’s Disease*. arXiv:1805.03909.

- For the **PCA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Crutch, S.J., Lehmann, M., Schott, J.M., Rabinovici, G.D., Rossor, M.N. and Fox, N.C. (2012). *Posterior cortical atrophy*. The Lancet Neurology, 11(2), pp.170-178.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, ready for further processing or review.
