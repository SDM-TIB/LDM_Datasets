To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Artificial to Spiking Neural Networks Conversion for Scientific Machine Learning" by Qian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will pay close attention to any figures or tables that summarize the datasets or their performance metrics. This can provide additional context about how the datasets were used and their significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) mentioned in the context of solving various differential equations. The paper discusses several equations, such as the Poisson equation, diffusion-reaction equation, wave equation, and Burgers equation, which may imply the use of specific datasets for training and validation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as per the requirements. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to facilitate easy understanding and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are structured and ready for any further processing or review.
