To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Automatic Question Usability Evaluation Toolkit" by Steven Moore et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their toolkit on a diverse dataset of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across various domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 3.3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Dataset from Costello et al. (2018)**: This dataset includes MCQs in Computer Science, Humanities, and Healthcare, sourced from prominent MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their evaluation.

2. **Dataset from Moore et al. (2023)**: This dataset contains student-generated MCQs from Chemistry and Statistics courses. It is important to note that both datasets were evaluated by human experts, which adds credibility to their findings.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **dataset from Costello et al. (2018)**, the citation is:
  > Costello, E., Holland, J.C., Kirwan, C. (2018). Evaluation of MCQs from MOOCs for common item writing flaws. *BMC Research Notes*, 11(1), 1-6. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-018-3959-4.

- For the **dataset from Moore et al. (2023)**, the citation is:
  > Moore, S., Nguyen, H.A., Chen, T., Stamper, J. (2023). Assessing the Quality of Multiple-Choice Questions Using GPT-4 and Rule-Based Methods. In *Responsive and Sustainable Educational Futures* (pp. 229-245). Springer Nature Switzerland. 

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the sources as required. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the study and their relevance to the research findings.
