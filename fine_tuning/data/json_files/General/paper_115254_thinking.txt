To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompt Tuning with Soft Context Sharing for Vision-Language Models" by Kun Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three multi-task few-shot datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **General-10**: This dataset is constructed from 10 public image classification datasets, including Caltech101, DTD, EuroSAT, FGVCAircraft, Food101, Flowers102, Oxford-Pets, StanfordCars, SUN397, and UCF101. It includes both coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks.

2. **Plant-6**: This dataset is specialized for plant classification and is built from 6 public datasets: FruitVegetable, KaggleFlower, KaggleMushroom, KaggleVegetable, PlantSeedling, and PlantVillage.

3. **Fashion-20**: This dataset is specifically for fashion classification and consists of 20 tasks related to various fashion attributes. It was collected by the authors and contains approximately 24,000 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **General-10**, since it is a combination of multiple datasets, I will cite the individual datasets:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
