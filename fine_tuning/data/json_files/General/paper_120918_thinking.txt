To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Democratization of Retail Trading: Can Redditâ€™s WallStreetBets Outperform Investment Bank Analysts?" by Tolga Buz and Gerard de Melo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a data-driven empirical study based on **more than 1.6 million WSB posts** and **over 16,000 analyst recommendations**. This suggests that there are significant datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their data acquisition process. They mention compiling an extensive dataset of **1,614,976 WSB submissions** from January 2018 to March 2022, which they obtained using the **Pushshift service**. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Additionally, they reference the use of **financial information from Yahoo! Finance** for the S&P 500 stocks, which is another dataset that needs to be noted.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of WSB recommendations compared to those from the top 20 investment banks, indicating that they have aggregated data from these banks as well. They mention that the investment recommendations from these banks total **42,730** over the reviewed time frame, which is another dataset to extract.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **WallStreetBets Dataset**: The dataset of WSB submissions is derived from:
   > Jason Baumgartner, Savvas Zannettou, Brian Keegan, Megan Squire, and Jeremy Blackburn. *The Pushshift Reddit Dataset*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, volume 14, 2020.

2. **Yahoo! Finance Data**: The financial data for S&P 500 stocks is sourced from:
   > Yahoo! Finance. *Yahoo! Finance API*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

3. **Investment Recommendations from Banks**: The aggregated investment recommendations are based on data from:
   > Tolga Buz and Gerard de Melo. *Should you take investment advice from WallStreetBets? A data-driven approach*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.02728, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, including their sources and relevance to the research conducted in the paper. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study.
