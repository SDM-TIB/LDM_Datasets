To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Sample Complexity of Offline Reinforcement Learning with Deep ReLU Networks in Besov Spaces" by Thanh Nguyen-Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and enables others to locate the datasets. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "OpenAI Gym" for reinforcement learning tasks, I would look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L., Schneider, J., & Schulman, J. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01583.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly and concisely, ready for any further processing or review.
