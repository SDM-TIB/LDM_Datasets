To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Dementia from Speech and Transcripts using Transformers" by Loukas Ilias et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ADReSS Challenge dataset**, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **ADReSS Challenge dataset** specifically, describing its composition of 78 AD patients and 78 non-AD patients, and the methodology used to collect the data, including the task assigned to participants.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ADReSS Challenge dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Luz, S., Haider, F., de la Fuente, S., Fromm, D., MacWhinney, B. (2020). *Alzheimer’s Dementia Recognition Through Spontaneous Speech: The ADReSS Challenge*. In Proceedings of Interspeech 2020, pp. 2172–2176. doi:10.21437/Interspeech.2020-2571.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will conclude my extraction here.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the **ADReSS Challenge dataset** using the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper referencing.
