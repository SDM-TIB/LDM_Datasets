To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Very Deep VAEs Generalize Autoregressive Models and Can Outperform Them on Images" by Rewon Child, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on **CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ**, which suggests these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they trained their models on **CIFAR-10**, **ImageNet-32**, **ImageNet-64**, and **FFHQ-256** and **FFHQ-1024**. This confirms that these datasets are indeed part of their evaluation.

Now, I will look for specific descriptions of each dataset in the paper. The authors provide some context about the datasets in the experiments section, but I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset.

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

3. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset contains high-quality images of human faces. The citation for FFHQ is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

4. **FFHQ-256 and FFHQ-1024**: These are specific resolutions of the FFHQ dataset, but they refer to the same dataset. The citation remains the same as for FFHQ.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
