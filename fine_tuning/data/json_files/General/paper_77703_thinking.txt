To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classification of entities via their descriptive sentences" by Chao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their system to **2.1 million Baidu Baike entities**, which indicates a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Dataset and task)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the entities and their descriptions are sourced from **Baidu Baike**, which contains nearly **15 million Chinese pages**. This section provides critical information about the dataset's size and its source.

The authors further clarify that **12.4 million entities** have been linked to the Baidu Concept Base, while **2.6 million entities** remain unlinked due to quality issues. This distinction is important for understanding the dataset's composition.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their classification method applied to the **2.1 million open-domain entities**, confirming the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Baidu Baike dataset. However, since Baidu Baike is a well-known online encyclopedia, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note it as a source of the dataset.

The citation for the Baidu Baike can be referenced as:
> Baidu Baike. *Baidu Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://baike.baidu.com/

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Baidu Baike Entities**: A dataset containing approximately 2.1 million entities with descriptions sourced from Baidu Baike.

After this process, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
