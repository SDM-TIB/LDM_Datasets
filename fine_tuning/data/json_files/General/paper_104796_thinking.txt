To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Poison Forensics: Traceback of Data Poisoning Attacks in Neural Networks" by Shawn Shan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a forensic tool for tracing back data poisoning attacks, but does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Overview of Evaluation)**, where the authors list the datasets used for their evaluation. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 50,000 training images across 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1,281,167 training images across 1,000 classes, commonly used for benchmarking in computer vision.
3. **VGGFace**: A dataset for face recognition containing images of 2,622 different individuals.
4. **Wenger Face**: A dataset used for physical backdoor attacks in facial recognition, though specific details about its size or structure are not provided.
5. **EMBER Malware**: A dataset consisting of 2,351-dimensional feature vectors extracted from Portable Executable (PE) files for malware classification.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of CVPR, IEEE, 2009.

- For **VGGFace**:
  > Omkar M Parkhi, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Deep face recognition*. In Proceedings of BMVC, 2015.

- For **Wenger Face**:
  > Emily Wenger, Josephine Passananti, Arjun Bhagoji, Yuanshun Yao, Haitao Zheng, and Ben Y. Zhao. *Backdoor attacks against deep learning systems in the physical world*. In Proceedings of CVPR, 2021.

- For **EMBER Malware**:
  > Hyrum S Anderson and Phil Roth. *EMBER: An open dataset for training static PE malware machine learning models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.04637, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
