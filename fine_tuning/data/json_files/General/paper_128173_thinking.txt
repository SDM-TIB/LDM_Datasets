To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hiding in Plain Sight: Disguising Data Stealing Attacks in Federated Learning" by Kostadin Garov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets utilized for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, but with 100 classes containing 600 images each. This dataset is also widely used in the machine learning community for benchmarking.

3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories. It is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
