To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MRI to FDG-PET: Cross-Modal Synthesis Using 3D U-Net For Multi-Modal Alzheimer’s Classification" by Apoorva Sikka et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on MRI and PET scans, but I need to look for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of acquiring both MRI and PET scans for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, hinting at the need for a dataset that includes both modalities. However, I need to find the exact dataset used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They state that the experiments were conducted on scans obtained from the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** database. They specify that a total of 384 subjects were included, with both MRI and PET modalities.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the ADNI dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation for the ADNI dataset is:

> Mueller, S.G., Weiner, M.W., Thal, L.J., Petersen, R.C., Jack, C., Jagust, W., Trojanowski, J.Q., Toga, A.W., Beckett, L. "The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative." *Neuroimaging Clinics of North America*, 2005.

Since the authors did not provide a specific citation for the ADNI dataset in the methods section, I will use the citation from the references.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise entry for the dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ADNI dataset, ready for further processing or review.
