To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformer-Based Speech Recognition On Extreme Edge-Computing Devices" by Mingbin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) on resource-constrained devices, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the Conformer architecture and its applications but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a training corpus of **17k-hour audio-transcript pairs** sourced from anonymized virtual assistant queries, which is crucial information. They also mention a **20k queries accuracy test set** curated in the same manner. This indicates that the datasets used for training and testing are based on real-world data, but I need to find the full citation for these datasets.

I will then check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they reference the methodology and sources used for data collection. 

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. For the **17k-hour audio-transcript pairs**, the citation is:
   > Xu, M., Jin, A., Wang, S., Su, M., Ng, T., Mason, H., Han, S., Deng, Y., Huang, Z., & Krishnamoorthy, M. (2023). Conformer-Based Speech Recognition On Extreme Edge-Computing Devices. *Proceedings of the Interspeech 2023 Conference*.

2. For the **20k queries accuracy test set**, the citation is:
   > Xu, M., Jin, A., Wang, S., Su, M., Ng, T., Mason, H., Han, S., Deng, Y., Huang, Z., & Krishnamoorthy, M. (2023). Conformer-Based Speech Recognition On Extreme Edge-Computing Devices. *Proceedings of the Interspeech 2023 Conference*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
