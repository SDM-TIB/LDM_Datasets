To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast, Flexible Models for Discovering Topic Correlation across Weakly-Related Collections" by Jingwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the models are evaluated on "synthetic data" and a "case study of modeling over 300k documents in collections of sciences and humanities research from JSTOR." This indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors discuss their evaluations. They mention using "synthetic data generated to simulate various collection-level asymmetries" and also refer to "a sample of 5,036 documents from JSTOR." This suggests that both synthetic data and a real-world dataset from JSTOR are used for their experiments.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors describe that they generated synthetic data for their evaluations, but they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is created for the purpose of the study. I will note that this dataset is not publicly available and is specific to their experiments.

2. **JSTOR Dataset**: The authors mention that they sampled 2,465 documents from JSTOR, which is a well-known digital library. I will need to find the appropriate citation for JSTOR to include in my dataset documentation.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations related to JSTOR or any specific papers that might have used JSTOR data. However, since JSTOR is a digital library and not a dataset in the traditional sense, I will cite it as follows:

- For the JSTOR dataset, the citation is:
  > JSTOR. *JSTOR: A Digital Library for Scholars, Researchers, and Students*. Available at: https://www.jstor.org.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified two datasets:
1. **Synthetic Data**: Not formally cited, generated for the study.
2. **JSTOR Dataset**: Cited as a digital library.

I will now prepare the final output with the dataset entries, ensuring that the citations are correctly formatted and complete.
