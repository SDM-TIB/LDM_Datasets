To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Image Captioning with Integrated Bottom-Up and Multi-level Residual Top-Down Attention for Game Scene Understanding" by Jian Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created two game datasets to evaluate their proposed model, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets & Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **GD Det**: This dataset is created by the authors for game object detection. It contains 4,725 training images, 834 validation images, and 1,390 testing images, with 7 object classes (human, gun, axe, sword, monster, car, motorcycle).

2. **GD ImgCap**: This is the game image captioning dataset created by the authors, consisting of 7,558 game images collected from 131 different game videos. It includes 5,920 training images, 658 validation images, and 606 test images, with captions ranging from 2 to 19 words.

I will also note that the authors mention using **Visual Genome** and **V-COCO** datasets in their experiments, but since the focus is on the datasets they created, I will prioritize GD Det and GD ImgCap.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Visual Genome**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, L.-J., Shamma, D. A., et al. (2017). Visual genome: Connecting language and vision using crowd-sourced dense image annotations. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 123(1), 32â€“73.

- For **V-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Gupta, S., & Malik, J. (2015). Visual semantic role labeling. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.04474*.

Since GD Det and GD ImgCap are original datasets created by the authors, they do not have external citations but should be referenced as follows:

- **GD Det**: Created by the authors for game object detection.
- **GD ImgCap**: Created by the authors for game image captioning.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and is ready for review.
