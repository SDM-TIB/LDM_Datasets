To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "TacoERE: Cluster-aware Compression for Event Relation Extraction" by Yong Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on three ERE datasets: **MAVEN-ERE, EventStoryLine, and HiEve**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 3.1, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **MAVEN-ERE**: This dataset is described as a unified large-scale human-annotated ERE dataset containing 4,480 documents, 112,276 events, 57,992 causal relations, and 15,841 subevent relations. The authors mention the data split into training, development, and test sets.

2. **EventStoryLine**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 258 documents, 22 topics, 5,334 events, and 5,655 causal relations. They also mention the use of a specific version (0.9) and the methodology for creating the development set.

3. **HiEve**: This dataset is noted to contain 100 documents, 3,185 events, and 3,648 subevent relations, with a specific split for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MAVEN-ERE**, the citation is:
  > Xiaozhi Wang, Yulin Chen, Ning Ding, Hao Peng, Zimu Wang, Yankai Lin, Xu Han, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, and Jie Zhou. *MAVEN-ERE: A Unified Large-scale Dataset for Event Coreference, Temporal, Causal, and Subevent Relation Extraction*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, pages 926â€“941, 2022. [Link](https://github.com/THUKEG/MAVEN-ERE).

- For **EventStoryLine**, the citation is:
  > Tommaso Caselli and Piek Vossen. *The Storyline Annotation and Representation Scheme (StaR): A Proposal*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Computing News Storylines, 2016. [Link](https://github.com/tommasoc80/EventStoryLine).

- For **HiEve**, the citation is:
  > Goran Glavas, Jan Snajder, Marie-Francine Moens, and Parisa KordJamshidi. *HiEve: A Corpus for Extracting Event Hierarchies from News Stories*. In Proceedings of LREC, 2014. [Link](http://takelab.fer.hr/hievents.rar).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
