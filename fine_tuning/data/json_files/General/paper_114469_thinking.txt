To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EgPDE-Net: Building Continuous Neural Networks for Time Series Prediction with Exogenous Variables" by Penglei Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any tables or descriptions that summarize the datasets. In this paper, there is a table (Table II) that summarizes four datasets used for the experiments, which is crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **SML2010**: This dataset is used for indoor temperature forecasting, sampled every minute, with 4,137 instances and 13 features.
2. **Electricity**: This dataset is for electricity consumption prediction, containing 22,201 instances and 15 features, sampled hourly.
3. **ETTh1**: This dataset consists of 17,420 instances and 6 features, also sampled hourly.
4. **ETTh2**: Similar to ETTh1, this dataset has 17,420 instances and 6 features, sampled hourly.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For **SML2010**, the citation is:
  > F. Zamora-Martinez, P. Romeu, P. Botella-Rocamora, and J. Pardo. "Online learning of indoor temperature forecasting models towards energy efficiency." *Energy and Buildings*, vol. 83, pp. 162â€“172, 2014.

- For **Electricity**, the citation is:
  > A. Jain. "HomeStead(US) Electricity Consumption." Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unajtheb/homesteadus-electricity-consumption.

- For **ETTh1** and **ETTh2**, the paper does not provide specific citations, but they are mentioned as datasets collected from two separated counties in China.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
