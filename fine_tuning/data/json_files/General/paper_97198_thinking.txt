To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Understanding Learning in Neural Networks with Linear Teachers" by Roei Sarussi, Alon Brutzkus, and Amir Globerson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical results validating the theoretical analysis, which may indicate the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation and testing. I will pay close attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

In this paper, the authors mention using **synthetic datasets** and **real datasets** for their experiments. I will note the specific datasets they refer to, including any details about their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, and any relevant splits (e.g., training/test).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a synthetic dataset generated for their experiments, I will note that it is a custom dataset and may not have a formal citation. However, if they refer to established datasets like MNIST or CIFAR-10, I will find the appropriate citations for those.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
