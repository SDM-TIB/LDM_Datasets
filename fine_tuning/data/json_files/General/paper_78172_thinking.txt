To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BranchyNet: Fast Inference via Early Exiting from Deep Neural Networks" by Surat Teerapittayanon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors studied the BranchyNet architecture using several well-known networks and datasets, specifically mentioning **MNIST** and **CIFAR10**. This suggests that these datasets are likely to be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used for evaluation. In the results section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated Branchy-LeNet on the **MNIST dataset** and both Branchy-AlexNet and Branchy-ResNet on the **CIFAR10 dataset**. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper. The authors typically provide information about the datasets in the introduction or background sections. The **MNIST dataset** is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, while the **CIFAR10 dataset** consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. However, I need to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets.

To find the full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Available online](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

- For the **CIFAR10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Available online](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
