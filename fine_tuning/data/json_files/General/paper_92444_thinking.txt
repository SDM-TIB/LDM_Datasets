To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Convolutional Neural Networks" by Hengrui Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the performance of integer networks on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using two specific datasets for their experiments:

1. **VDSR Dataset**: This dataset is used for image super-resolution tasks. The authors reference the original paper that introduced VDSR, which provides details about the dataset's characteristics.

2. **VRCNN Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for compression artifact reduction tasks. Similar to the VDSR dataset, the authors refer to the original work that describes this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

- For the **VDSR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jiwon Kim, Jung Kwon Lee, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Accurate image super-resolution using very deep convolutional networks*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), (June 2016).

- For the **VRCNN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuanying Dai, Dong Liu, and Feng Wu. *A convolutional neural network approach for post-processing in HEVC intra coding*. In MultiMedia Modeling, pp. 28â€“39, Cham, (2017). Springer International Publishing.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
