To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Image is Worth 1/2 Tokens After Layer 2: Plug-and-Play Inference Acceleration for Large Vision-Language Models" by Liang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the FastV method on various image and video understanding tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **Nocaps**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks. It is referenced in the context of evaluating the performance of the FastV method.

2. **Flickr30k**: Another dataset used for image captioning, mentioned alongside Nocaps for performance evaluation.

3. **A-OKVQA**: This dataset is used for visual question answering tasks, and the authors report accuracy metrics based on this dataset.

4. **MMMU**: This is a multimodal benchmark that requires advanced reasoning skills, also used to evaluate the FastV method.

5. **PCA-Bench**: This dataset is mentioned as a complex embodied reasoning benchmark, used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method.

6. **TGIF-QA**: A dataset for video question answering tasks, referenced in the context of evaluating FastV's performance on video understanding.

7. **MSVD-QA**: Another dataset for video question answering, mentioned in the same context as TGIF-QA.

8. **MSRVTT-QA**: This dataset is also used for video question answering tasks, included in the evaluation of FastV.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation.
