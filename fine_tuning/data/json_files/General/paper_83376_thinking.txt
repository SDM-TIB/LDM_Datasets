To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real time backbone for semantic segmentation" by Zhengeng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the **Cityscapes val dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental setup in section III, where they specifically mention the **Cityscapes dataset**. 

In section III.B, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Cityscapes dataset**: it is a large-scale dataset designed for street scene understanding, containing 5,000 finely annotated images and over 20,000 coarsely annotated images collected from 50 different cities. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Cityscapes dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016, pp. 3213â€“3223.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Cityscapes dataset** for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Cityscapes dataset** to ensure it is ready for any further processing or review.
