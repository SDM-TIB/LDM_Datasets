To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Phi-3 Technical Report: A Highly Capable Language Model Locally on Your Phone" by Microsoft, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model's performance is based on a dataset that is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, which indicates that there is a specific dataset involved in the training process. However, it does not provide a name or citation for this dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **training** sections. In the **Training Methodology** section, the authors describe the training data as a combination of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. However, they do not specify the names of any datasets or provide citations.

I will also check the **post-training** section, where they mention using various datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). They refer to "helpfulness and harmlessness preference datasets" and mention modifications inspired by other works, but again, no specific dataset names or citations are provided.

In the **academic benchmarks** section, the authors compare their model's performance against various benchmarks, but these are not datasets in the traditional sense; they are evaluation metrics rather than training datasets.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily focus on other models and methodologies rather than specific datasets used for training.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the authors discuss the types of data used (public web data and synthetic data), they do not provide specific dataset names or full citations for any datasets. Therefore, I will note that no explicit datasets were extracted from this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, indicating that while the paper discusses the training data broadly, it lacks specific dataset names and citations that would typically be required for a comprehensive dataset extraction.
