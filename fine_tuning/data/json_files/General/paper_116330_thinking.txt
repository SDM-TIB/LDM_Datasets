To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Robust Beamforming Design for WPT-assisted D2D Communications in MISO-NOMA: Fractional Programming and Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Shiyu Jiao, Fang Fang, and Zhiguo Ding, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include the datasets employed.

I will then focus on the **methodology** section, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup. This section may detail the datasets used for simulations or evaluations, including any specific parameters or characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to wireless power transfer (WPT), device-to-device (D2D) communications, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. I will also note any specific simulation parameters or configurations that are relevant to the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.
