To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverse-Free Fast Natural Gradient Descent Method for Deep Learning" by Xinwei Ou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the proposed FNGD method on image classification and machine translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks. They mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for image classification and the **Multi30K** dataset for machine translation. This gives me the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **Multi30K Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. Elliott and K. K. Duh. *Multi30K: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, pages 70-74, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
