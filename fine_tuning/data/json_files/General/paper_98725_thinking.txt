To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Doppler Radar Based Activity Recognition for e-Healthcare" by Yordanka Karayaneva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors may refer to previous studies or datasets that are foundational to their work. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the **dataset description** subsection. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this paper, the authors describe the **Doppler-Radar-2018 dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will extract the following details:

1. **Doppler-Radar-2018 Dataset**: This dataset is collected in a controlled environment and includes recordings of five activities (walking, running, jumping, turning, and standing) performed by four participants. Each activity is repeated multiple times, resulting in a total of 200 samples.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Doppler-Radar-2018 dataset**. The citation is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. If the dataset is referenced in other works, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

The citation for the **Doppler-Radar-2018 dataset** is:
> W. Li, B. Tan, Y. Xu, and R. J. Piechocki. "Log-Likelihood Clustering-Enabled Passive RF Sensing for Residential Activity Recognition," in IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 18, no. 13, pp. 5413-5421, July 2018, doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2018.2834739.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that it is clearly organized and ready for any required format or structure.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper citations.
