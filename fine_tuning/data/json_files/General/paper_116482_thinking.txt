To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Language Models Are Also Few-Shot Learners" by Ajay Patel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by scanning the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **FLORES-101** dataset for evaluating machine translation tasks, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **related work** and **methodology** sections to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. In the **related work** section, the authors reference the **WMT14** dataset, which is commonly used for machine translation tasks. This is another dataset I need to note.

I will then check the **experiments** section, where the authors describe their evaluation methods. Here, they mention using the **SQuAD v1.1** dataset for question answering tasks and the **CNN/Daily Mail** dataset for summarization tasks. This confirms that these datasets are also part of their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References** section to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. **FLORES-101**:
   > Goyal, N., Gao, C., Chaudhary, V., Chen, P.-J., Wenzek, G., Ju, D., Krishnan, S., Ranzato, M.A., Guzman, F., & Fan, A. (2021). The FLORES-101 evaluation benchmark for low-resource and multilingual machine translation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.03193*.

2. **WMT14**:
   > Bojar, O., Buck, C., Federmann, C., Haddow, B., Koehn, P., Leveling, J., Monz, C., Pecina, P., Post, M., Saint-Amand, H., Soricut, R., Specia, L., & Tamchyna, A. (2014). Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation. In *Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation* (pp. 12-58). Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **SQuAD v1.1**:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing* (pp. 2383-2392).

4. **CNN/Daily Mail**:
   > Nallapati, R., Zhou, B., dos Santos, C., Gul√ßehre, C., & Xiang, B. (2016). Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond. In *Proceedings of The 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning* (pp. 280-290).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations, which is crucial for any downstream tasks or documentation.
