To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Answer Sentence Reranking via Automatically Translated Data" by Thuy Vu and Alessandro Moschitti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data modeling sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a large-scale QA dataset for English, referred to as **QAD**, which is a strong candidate for extraction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Modeling)**, where the authors describe the construction of the **Question Answering Datasets (QAD)**. They mention that this dataset contains approximately 120,000 question-answer pairs, which is significant. I will take note of the statistics provided in Table 1, which outlines the number of questions, answers, and wrong answers in the dataset.

In this section, the authors also discuss how they transferred the QAD dataset into other languages using machine translation, but the original dataset remains the primary focus for citation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the QAD dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for QAD in the references, but they do reference other works that may be relevant to the dataset's construction. However, since QAD is a dataset created by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have an external citation.

The relevant details I have gathered are:
1. **Dataset Name**: Question Answering Datasets (QAD)
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset for AS2 containing approximately 120,000 question-answer pairs.
   - **Statistics**: 
     - Train: 913 questions, 24,558 answers, 69,142 wrong answers
     - Dev: 551 questions, 4,391 answers, 9,509 wrong answers
     - Test: 427 questions, 3,334 answers, 7,341 wrong answers

Since QAD is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I will create an entry for the QAD dataset, noting that it is a self-created dataset by the authors and does not have an external citation. The details will include its name, description, and statistics as outlined in the paper.
