To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching Pre-trained Language Model with Entity Information for Relation Classification" by Shanchan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved significant improvements on the **SemEval-2010 Task 8 relational dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relation classification task and reference various methods but do not introduce new datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metric)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset** for their experiments. They describe this dataset in detail, mentioning that it contains nine semantic relation types and one artificial relation type, with a total of 10,717 sentences. This section confirms that this is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iris Hendrickx, Su Nam Kim, Zornitsa Kozareva, Preslav Nakov, Diarmuid ´O. S´eaghdha, Sebastian Pad´o, Marco Pennacchiotti, Lorenza Romano, and Stan Szpakowicz. *SemEval-2010 Task 8: Multi-way Classification of Semantic Relations Between Pairs of Nominals*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval ’10), pages 33–38, 2010.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete with the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
