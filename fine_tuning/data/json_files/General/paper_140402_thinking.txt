To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Do Deep Neural Network Solutions Form a Star Domain?" by Ankit Sonthalia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are often described in the context of experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the empirical validation of their conjecture using the Starlight algorithm. They mention using **ResNet18 models trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 3.4) where they provide empirical evidence for their claims. They specifically mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for training their models. The authors also refer to the **ImageNet-1k** dataset in the additional results section, where they validate their conjecture on a larger scale.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

3. **ImageNet-1k Dataset**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009. URL: http://www.image-net.org/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
