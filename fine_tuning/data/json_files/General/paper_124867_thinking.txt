To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selecting Features by their Resilience to the Curse of Dimensionality" by Maximilian Stubbemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **OpenML-CC18 Curated Classification benchmark (Open18)** and the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments section**. In this case, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). They state that they conducted experiments on the **OpenML-CC18** benchmark and the **Open Graph Benchmark**, which includes datasets like **ogbn-arxiv**, **ogbn-products**, and **ogbn-mag**.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset mentioned:

1. **OpenML-CC18 Curated Classification benchmark (Open18)**: This benchmark is referenced multiple times, and it is essential to note that it consists of various datasets used for classification tasks. The specific datasets used in their experiments are not detailed in the text, but the reference to OpenML provides a clear indication of its significance.

2. **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)**: The authors mention using datasets from OGB, specifically **ogbn-arxiv**, **ogbn-products**, and **ogbn-mag**. These datasets are designed for machine learning tasks on graph-structured data.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OpenML-CC18**, the citation is:
  > Bischl, B., Casalicchio, G., Feurer, M., et al. (2019). Openml benchmarking suites. arXiv:1708.03731v2.

- For **Open Graph Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., et al. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
