To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph2Vid: Flow graph to Video Grounding for Weakly-supervised Multi-Step Localization" by Nikita Dvornik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions extending the **CrossTask dataset** with procedure flow graph information, indicating that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset construction)**, where the authors describe how they constructed their dataset. They mention that they extended the **CrossTask dataset** by associating procedure text with each category and parsing the instructions into a procedure flow graph. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's purpose and how it was modified for their experiments.

In this section, the authors outline the steps taken to create the dataset:
1. They grabbed procedure text from the web for each procedure class (e.g., "Build floating shelves" or "Making pancakes").
2. They extracted flow graphs from the procedural text, ensuring that each node corresponds to a step from the procedure text.
3. They manually found correspondences between nodes in the graph and step instructions provided with the original datasets.

The authors also mention that these correspondences are used to associate the original ground truth temporal annotations of each step with nodes in their flow graph.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CrossTask dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Zhukov, D., Alayrac, J.B., Cinbis, R.G., Fouhey, D., Laptev, I., & Sivic, J. (2019). Cross-task weakly supervised learning from instructional videos. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

Since the paper primarily discusses the **CrossTask dataset**, I will document this dataset in detail, including its modifications as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the **CrossTask dataset** as it is crucial for proper attribution in any downstream applications or analyses.
