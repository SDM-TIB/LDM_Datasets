To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Statistical Inference for the Logarithmic Spatial Heteroskedasticity Model with Exogenous Variables" by Bing Su, Fukang Zhu, and Ke Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or examples.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the analysis. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors discuss a real data example on house selling prices, which suggests that there is a dataset related to real estate. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its source, the number of observations, and the variables included.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for providing full citations for each dataset. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original sources.

For the dataset related to house selling prices, I will extract the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: House Selling Price Dataset
2. **Description**: Contains selling prices of single-family homes and corresponding values of ten different house characteristics in Lucas counties, Ohio, during 1993–1998.
3. **Citation**: Billé, A. G., Benedetti, R., and Postiglione, P. (2017). A two-step approach to account for unobserved spatial heterogeneity. Spatial Economic Analysis, 12, 452–471.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary details accurately.
