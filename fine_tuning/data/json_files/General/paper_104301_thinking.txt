To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization Networks for Integrated Machine Learning" by Michael Kommenda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Feature Selection)**, where the authors discuss the evaluation of their optimization network on a benchmark problem. They mention creating a dataset containing 100 features with 1000 observations sampled from a standard normal distribution. This indicates that a dataset was generated specifically for their experiments.

I will note the details provided about this dataset:
- The dataset consists of 100 features, where each observation is sampled from a standard normal distribution \(N(\mu = 0, \sigma = 1)\).
- The dependent variable \(y\) is calculated as a linear combination of 15 randomly selected features with uniformly sampled feature weights and a noise term.

Since this dataset is generated for the purpose of the study, I will treat it as a unique dataset for citation purposes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any existing datasets that the authors might have used or referenced. However, the paper primarily discusses the dataset they created for their experiments, and there are no external datasets cited in the references that pertain to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format. The dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

1. **Generated Dataset for Feature Selection**:
   - Description: A dataset containing 100 features, with 1000 observations sampled from a standard normal distribution. The dependent variable is derived from a linear combination of 15 selected features.
   - Citation: Since this dataset is generated by the authors for their specific experiments, I will cite the paper itself as the source of this dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Kommenda, M., Karder, J., Beham, A., Burlacu, B., Kronberger, G., Wagner, S., & Affenzeller, M. (2018). Optimization Networks for Integrated Machine Learning. In *Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Aided Systems Theory*. Springer.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
