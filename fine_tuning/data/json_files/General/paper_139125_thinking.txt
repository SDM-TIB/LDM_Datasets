To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emoji Driven Crypto Assets Market Reactions" by Xiaorui Zuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data and methodology, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions leveraging Twitter data for sentiment analysis, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to tweets.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of social media in cryptocurrency markets, hinting at the use of Twitter data. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in this section.

In the **data and methodology section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their analysis. They mention two key datasets:

1. **Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets harvested from Twitter using the Twitter API, focusing on tweets that contain the keyword "crypto" and emojis. The authors specify that this dataset includes **14,013 tweets** collected from November 8, 2023, to January 28, 2024.

2. **Test Dataset**: The test dataset is derived from the "Bitcoin tweets - 16M tweets With Sentiment Tagged" dataset available on Kaggle. The authors filtered this dataset to include only tweets containing emojis, which they then analyzed for sentiment.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the findings related to these datasets, confirming their relevance and application in the study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Twitter dataset**, while the authors do not provide a formal citation, they mention using the Twitter API for data collection. I will note this as a source but recognize that it may not have a formal citation.

- For the **Kaggle dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gaurav Dutta. *Bitcoin tweets - 16M tweets With Sentiment Tagged*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/bitcoin-tweets-16m-tweets-with-sentiment-tagged?resource=download.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
