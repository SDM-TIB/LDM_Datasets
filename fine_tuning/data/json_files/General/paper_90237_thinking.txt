To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic ReLU" by Yinpeng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet** dataset for image classification and the **COCO** dataset for keypoint detection. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their size, structure, and any relevant splits or annotations.

In the **ImageNet section**, the authors state that it contains 1,281,167 images for training and 50,000 images for validation, which is crucial information to include. For the **COCO dataset**, I will note that it consists of 57K images and 150K person instances labeled with 17 keypoints.

After gathering the necessary details, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In: 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. pp. 248–255. IEEE (2009).

2. For **COCO**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In: European conference on computer vision. pp. 740–755. Springer (2014).

Now that I have the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
