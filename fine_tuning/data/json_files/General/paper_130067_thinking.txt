To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Split Learning with Only Positive Labels for Resource-Constrained IoT Environment" by Praveen Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that both datasets contain 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image having dimensions of 32x32 pixels. They also specify that the CIFAR-10 dataset has 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 dataset has 100 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citations I need to retrieve are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

Both datasets are referenced from the same source, which is common for CIFAR datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
