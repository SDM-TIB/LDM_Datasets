To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Acoustic Word Embedding Learning via Correspondence Transformer Encoder" by Jingru Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce a self-supervised method to learn robust acoustic word embeddings from a large-scale unlabelled speech corpus. This indicates that there may be datasets involved, particularly in the context of training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **LibriSpeech dataset** for training, specifically the **train-clean-100** and **train-clean-360** splits. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **evaluation tasks** subsection within section 3 to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors refer to using the **Buckeye corpus** for a cross-domain evaluation and the **NCHLT corpus** for a cross-lingual evaluation on Xitsonga. This suggests that these datasets are also relevant for the experiments conducted.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **LibriSpeech Dataset**:

2. **Buckeye Corpus**:
   > M. A. Pitt, K. Johnson, E. Hume, S. Kiesling, and W. Raymond. *The Buckeye corpus of conversational speech: Labeling conventions and a test of transcriber reliability*. Speech Communication, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 89–95, 2005.

3. **NCHLT Corpus**:

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
