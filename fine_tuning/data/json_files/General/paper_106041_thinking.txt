To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Deep Neural Networks as Probability Estimators" by Yu Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of estimating conditional probabilities with DNNs but does not specify any datasets yet.

Moving on to the **methodology** section, I will look for any descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In the **experiments section**, the authors elaborate on their use of the MNIST dataset, confirming its application in their high-dimensional case analysis. They describe how they generated synthetic training data based on the MNIST dataset and how they mapped it back to the original image space.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Y. LeCun and C. Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MNIST dataset and does not introduce any other specific datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

I will create an entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing or review.
