To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust PCA Unrolling Network for Super-resolution Vessel Extraction in X-ray Coronary Angiography" by Binjie Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention that they collected **43 sequences of real clinical XCA images from Renji Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University**. This indicates that the dataset consists of clinical X-ray coronary angiography images.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of images, their resolution, and any annotations provided. The authors note that the length of each sequence ranges from **30 to 140 frames**, and the images were resized to **512 Ã— 512 resolution with 8 bits per pixel**. This information is crucial for describing the dataset comprehensively.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The authors mention that the images are heterogeneous, collected from different machines, including a medical angiography X-ray system from Philips and a digital silhouette angiography X-ray machine from Siemens. However, they do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a custom dataset collected for this study.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or cited in a formal manner, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset collected by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details, while also noting the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections to identify datasets.
2. Note the details about the dataset, including the number of images, resolution, and source.
3. Check the references for any formal citations related to the dataset.
4. Compile the information into a structured format, noting the proprietary nature of the dataset.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
