To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speeding up Convolutional Neural Networks By Exploiting the Sparsity of Rectifier Units" by Shaohuai Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in **section 5 (Experiments)**, where they mention the convolution layers tested on various deep networks. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors refer to several well-known deep learning architectures (LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet) and their corresponding datasets (e.g., MNIST for LeNet, CIFAR-10 for AlexNet, and ImageNet for GoogLeNet). I will note these datasets and their associated details, such as the number of classes and any specific configurations mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- **MNIST Dataset**: Typically cited as:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.
  
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Usually cited as:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.
  
- **ImageNet Dataset**: Commonly cited as:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for review or further processing.
