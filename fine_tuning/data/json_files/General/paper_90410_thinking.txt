To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Graph for Video Captioning with Knowledge Distillation" by Boxiao Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach through experiments on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset consists of 10,000 video clips, each annotated with 20 English sentences, covering a diverse range of categories. The authors follow a standard data split scheme for training, validation, and testing.

2. **MSVD**: This dataset contains 1,970 video clips collected from YouTube, with each clip supporting multi-lingual descriptions. The authors specify that they use English captions for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MSR-VTT**, the citation is:
  > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

- For **MSVD**, the citation is:
  > David L Chen and William B Dolan. *Collecting Highly Parallel Data for Paraphrase Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies-Volume 1, pages 190–200, 2011.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
