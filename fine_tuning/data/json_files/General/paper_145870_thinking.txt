To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anime Popularity Prediction Before Huge Investments: A Multimodal Approach Using Deep Learning" by JesÃºs Armenta-Segura and Grigori Sidorov, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a dataset was constructed from freely available internet sources, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of predicting anime popularity and mention the need for a suitable dataset. They reference various anime databases, which may provide insights into the dataset they ultimately used.

In the **Background** section, the authors describe the dataset they created, referred to as the **Anime Corpus**. They detail the scraping process from MyAnimeList (MAL), which resulted in a dataset of 11,873 anime entries with various attributes, including titles, plot summaries, and character information. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **Experimental Setup** and **Results** sections to confirm the dataset's usage in their experiments and any specific metrics or characteristics that are highlighted.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is derived from MyAnimeList, and the authors have constructed their own dataset based on this source. The citation for MyAnimeList is as follows:

- **MyAnimeList**: 
  > MyAnimeList. Available at: https://myanimelist.net/.

Additionally, since the authors created a specific dataset from this source, I will note that the dataset itself does not have a formal citation but is referred to as the **Anime Corpus**.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.
