To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Towards Automated Movie Trailer Generation" by Dawit Mureja Argaw et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the problem and context, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of creating movie trailers and mention the need for benchmarks in automatic trailer generation. This suggests that datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (Section 3.2), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. Here, they mention:

1. **MAD Dataset**: The authors state that they built new benchmarks based on this dataset, which is referenced as a mainstream movie dataset. They mention that they obtained 602 out of 650 movie-trailer pairs for MAD.

2. **MovieNet Dataset**: Similarly, they indicate that they constructed benchmarks using MovieNet, obtaining 989 out of 1100 movie-trailer pairs.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mattia Soldan, Alejandro Pardo, Juan León Alcázar, Fabian Caba, Chen Zhao, Silvio Giancola, and Bernard Ghanem. *MAD: A scalable dataset for language grounding in videos from movie audio descriptions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5026–5035, 2022.

- For **MovieNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qingqiu Huang, Yu Xiong, Anyi Rao, Jiaze Wang, and Dahua Lin. *Movienet: A holistic dataset for movie understanding*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2020: 16th European Conference, Glasgow, UK, August 23–28, 2020, Proceedings, Part IV 16, pages 709–727. Springer, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
