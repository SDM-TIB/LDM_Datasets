To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Easy Batch Normalization" by Arip Asadulaev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets," indicating that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state that they tested their method on the **FashionMNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. They provide details about the number of training and test samples for each dataset, confirming their relevance to the study.

In the **results section**, the authors present performance metrics for their models trained on these datasets, further validating their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **FashionMNIST**, the citation is:
   > Han, D., Kim, J., & Kim, J. (2018). *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

2. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are structured correctly for any downstream processing or review.
