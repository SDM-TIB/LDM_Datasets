To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Performance of Robust Control through Event-Triggered Learning" by Alexander von Rohr et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical examples sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of learning-based methods to improve robust controllers, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical examples section (Section IV)**, as this is where datasets are likely to be described. In this section, the authors mention using a prior distribution for an LQR benchmark problem based on Dean et al. (2020). This suggests that there may be datasets or data generation methods referenced.

Upon reviewing the empirical examples, I find that the authors refer to a specific benchmark problem and provide details about the parameters used, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset name. Instead, they describe the parameters for the LQR problem, which are derived from a prior distribution.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The authors reference several papers, including Dean et al. (2020), which may provide additional context or datasets related to the LQR problem.

The relevant citations I find are:

1. For the LQR benchmark problem:
   > Dean, S., Mania, H., Matni, N., Recht, B., & Tu, S. (2020). *On the sample complexity of the linear quadratic regulator*. Foundations of Computational Mathematics.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name but rather describes a benchmark problem based on existing literature, I will note that the dataset is implicitly derived from the parameters and methods discussed in the referenced work.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

- **LQR Benchmark Problem**: The dataset is based on the prior distribution parameters used for the LQR problem, as described in the empirical examples. The specific citation for this benchmark is Dean et al. (2020).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for review or further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the LQR benchmark problem as it is the only dataset contextually relevant to the paper.
