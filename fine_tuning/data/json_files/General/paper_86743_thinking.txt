To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning meets Graph Neural Networks: exploring a routing optimization use case" by Paul Almasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method in a specific scenario, which may indicate the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their model on a **SDN-based Optical Transport Network (OTN)** scenario. I need to look for specific datasets or benchmarks that are referenced in this context.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **real-world network topologies extracted from the Internet Topology Zoo dataset** for their experiments. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Internet Topology Zoo dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Knight, S., Nguyen, H. X., Falkner, N., Bowden, R., & Roughan, M. (2011). The internet topology zoo. *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications*, 29(9), 1765-1775.

Additionally, the authors mention training their model on the **14-node NSFNet topology**. I will also look for the citation for this topology. The citation is:
> Xiaojun Hei, Jun Zhang, Brahim Bensaou, and Chi-Chung Cheung. (2004). Wavelength converter placement in least-load-routing-based optical networks using genetic algorithms. *Journal of Optical Networking*, 3(5), 363-378.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Internet Topology Zoo dataset**:
   - Citation: Knight, S., Nguyen, H. X., Falkner, N., Bowden, R., & Roughan, M. (2011). The internet topology zoo. *IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications*, 29(9), 1765-1775.

2. **14-node NSFNet topology**:
   - Citation: Xiaojun Hei, Jun Zhang, Brahim Bensaou, and Chi-Chung Cheung. (2004). Wavelength converter placement in least-load-routing-based optical networks using genetic algorithms. *Journal of Optical Networking*, 3(5), 363-378.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
