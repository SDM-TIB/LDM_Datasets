To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning for Medical Adverse Event Detection from Free-Text Medical Narratives: A Case Study of Detecting Total Hip Replacement Dislocation" by Alireza Borjali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves detecting medical adverse events (AEs) from free-text medical narratives, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these narratives.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Data." Here, the authors describe the study cohort, which consists of primary total hip replacement (THR) patients operated within a regional network of multiple hospitals. They mention that the data includes radiology notes and telephone notes, which are crucial for the analysis.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:

1. **Radiology Notes**: The dataset includes 3014 radiology notes that were reviewed for indications of hip dislocation. These notes were categorized into three classes: current dislocation, evidence of previous dislocation, and no dislocation.

2. **Telephone Notes**: The dataset consists of 783 telephone notes, which were also reviewed and categorized into two classes: evidence of previous dislocation and no dislocation.

The authors also mention that a total of 105 patients sustained a dislocation, generating a total of 380 radiology notes and 174 telephone notes indicating a dislocation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related studies mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are derived from the authors' own data collection and do not have external citations.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details. The full citations for the datasets will be noted as follows:

- **Radiology Notes**: This dataset is derived from the institutional arthroplasty registry of the hospital network for primary THR, consisting of 3014 notes categorized into three classes.
  
- **Telephone Notes**: This dataset includes 783 notes collected from follow-up telephone conversations, categorized into two classes.

Since these datasets are original to the study, I will note that they do not have external citations but are part of the authors' research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
