To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Competitive Learning for Achieving Content-Specific Filters in Video Coding for Machines" by Honglei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the evaluation was conducted on the **OpenImages dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant for extraction.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they used **30k training images randomly selected from the training split of the OpenImages dataset** for their experiments. They also mention that the test sets for object detection and instance segmentation tasks contain **5k images**. This provides useful context about the dataset's size and purpose.

In the **references section**, I will locate the full citation for the OpenImages dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The Open Images Dataset V4: Unified image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection at scale*. In International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2020.

Since the paper primarily discusses the OpenImages dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
