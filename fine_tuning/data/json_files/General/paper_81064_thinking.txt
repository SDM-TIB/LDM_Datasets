To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaAnchor: Learning to Detect Objects with Customized Anchors" by Tong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **COCO detection task**, which indicates that a dataset is involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the challenges in object detection and mentions the use of anchor boxes, but it does not explicitly name any datasets. 

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using two different dataset splits for training: **COCO-all** and **COCO-mini**. They also specify that the evaluation is done on the **minival set**, which contains 5000 images. This section provides clear information about the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: The citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

2. **COCO-minival**: This is a subset of the COCO dataset, and since it is derived from the original COCO dataset, I will reference the same citation as above.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and can be easily referenced in future work.
