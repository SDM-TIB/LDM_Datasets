To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certified Robustness to Text Adversarial Attacks by Randomized [MASK]" by Jiehang Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **AGNEWS** and **SST2** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and results, confirming that they used the **AGNEWS** dataset for text classification and the **SST2** dataset for sentiment analysis. They provide details about the performance of their method on these datasets, which further solidifies their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **AGNEWS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zhang, Z., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 28, 649-657.

2. **SST2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 1631-1642.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
