To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thinking Like Transformers" by Gail Weiss et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. In the abstract, I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the dataset consists of."

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for specific dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data, etc.). If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and any context provided about their use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references** section to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for entries that correspond to the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the paper discusses any datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized, I will also verify their citations against known sources to ensure accuracy.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's information.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes proper citations for each dataset.
