To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NOWJ at COLIEE 2023 - Multi-Task and Ensemble Approaches in Legal Information Processing" by Thi-Hai-Yen Vuong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the competition tasks, but I need to look deeper for specific dataset names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the COLIEE competition and the tasks involved, but they do not specify datasets yet. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approaches for each task. Here, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section 4 (Experiment and Result)**, the authors provide detailed statistics for each task, including the datasets used. For **Task 1**, they mention a corpus related to Federal Court of Canada case laws, which is crucial information. The statistics table outlines the number of queries and candidate cases, confirming the dataset's relevance.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to several studies and datasets, but I need to ensure I capture the correct citations for the datasets used in the competition.

For **Task 1**, the dataset is:
- **Federal Court of Canada case laws**: This dataset is used for legal case retrieval and entails 959 query cases against 4400 candidate cases in the training set.

For **Task 2**, the dataset is:
- **Legal Textual Entailment Data Corpus**: This dataset includes 625 queries in the training dataset and 100 queries in the testing dataset.

I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the references provided in the paper. 

Now, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will involve summarizing the dataset details and formatting them appropriately for clarity and completeness.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
