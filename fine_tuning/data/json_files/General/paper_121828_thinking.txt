To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Experimental observation on a low-rank tensor model for eigenvalue problems" by Jun Hu and Pengzhan Jin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention testing their low-rank tensor model on the **MNIST dataset** for a classification problem. This indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.3 (Classification problem)**, where the authors provide details about the MNIST dataset. They describe it as a dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of images that can be represented as vectors in R^784, with labels corresponding to the digits from 0 to 9. This section confirms that the MNIST dataset is used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
