To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HateBERT: Retraining BERT for Abusive Language Detection in English" by Tommaso Caselli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on **RAL-E**, a dataset of Reddit comments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is significant.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the **RAL-E dataset** in detail, explaining how it was collected from banned Reddit communities. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention three additional datasets used for evaluation: **OffensEval 2019**, **AbusEval**, and **HatEval**. I will take note of these datasets as they are essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **RAL-E (Reddit Abusive Language English dataset)**: This dataset consists of 1,492,740 messages collected from Reddit communities banned for promoting offensive, abusive, or hateful content. The dataset spans from January 2012 to June 2015 and contains a total of 43,820,621 tokens.

2. **OffensEval 2019**: This dataset contains 14,100 tweets annotated for offensive language, with a training set of 13,240 messages and a test set of 860 messages. The dataset is part of the SemEval 2019 Task 6 evaluation exercise.

3. **AbusEval**: This dataset is derived from OffensEval 2019 by adding a layer of abusive language annotation. It also contains 14,100 tweets, with the same training and test splits as OffensEval 2019.

4. **HatEval**: This dataset includes 13,000 tweets annotated for hate speech against migrants and women, with a training set of 10,000 messages and a test set of 3,000 messages. It was distributed for the SemEval 2019 Task 5 evaluation exercise.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **HatEval**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
