To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-asymptotic bounds for stochastic optimization with biased noisy gradient oracles" by Nirav Bhavsar and Prashanth L.A., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **experiments or results section** of the paper, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **table or figure** summarizing the datasets, I will pay close attention to that as it often contains concise information about each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For this paper, I will look for any datasets mentioned in the context of biased gradient oracles or stochastic optimization. If the authors refer to specific datasets used for experiments, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the information clearly and accurately to reflect the details provided in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized and ready for presentation or further processing, adhering to any specific formatting guidelines if provided.
