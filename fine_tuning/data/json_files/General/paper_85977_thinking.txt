To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Byzantine-Resilient Stochastic Gradient Descent for Distributed Learning: A Lipschitz-Inspired Coordinate-wise Median Approach" by Haibo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments with **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they conducted extensive experiments using **multi-class logistic regression (MLR)** and **convolutional neural networks (CNN)** based on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. They provide specific details about the training setup, including batch sizes and the number of workers involved.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the datasets used:
1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class, commonly used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
