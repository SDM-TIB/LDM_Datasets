To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GLOBAL OPTIMALITY UNDER AMENABLE SYMMETRY CONSTRAINTS" by Peter Orbanz, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Paper Thoroughly**: I will start by reading the entire paper, paying close attention to sections that typically mention datasets, such as the introduction, methodology, experiments, and results. I will also look for any tables or figures that might summarize dataset information.

2. **Identify Explicit Mentions of Datasets**: As I read, I will highlight any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that define them.

3. **Locate Dataset Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

4. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will create a detailed entry that includes:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

5. **Cross-Reference with Other Sources**: If necessary, I will cross-reference the identified datasets with other academic papers or databases to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset entry.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a valuable resource for future research and analysis.
