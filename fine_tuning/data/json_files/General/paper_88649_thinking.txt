To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Fine-Grained Search Space Pruning and Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization" by Juho Lauri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors have utilized. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors usually describe the datasets in detail. I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, I will extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any specific metrics or features that are highlighted.

For this paper, I will pay particular attention to the **Network Repository** mentioned in the experimental results, as it is a source of datasets used in their experiments. I will note the specific datasets listed in the tables, such as "bio-WormNet-v3," "soc-digg," and others, along with their characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "bio-WormNet-v3" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is sourced from the Network Repository and provide the appropriate citation for the repository itself.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and ready for further use or analysis.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries.
