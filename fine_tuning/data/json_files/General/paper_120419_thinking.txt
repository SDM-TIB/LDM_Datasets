To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BORT: Towards Explainable Neural Networks with Bounded Orthogonal Constraint" by Borui Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their research.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4 (Experiment)**, the authors detail their classification experiments on **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet**. They provide specific results and comparisons for models optimized with their proposed method, Bort, against standard optimizers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, 2009.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In *CVPR*, 248-255.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset:

- **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, widely used for training various image processing systems.
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, commonly used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of images categorized into thousands of classes, used for training deep learning models.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
