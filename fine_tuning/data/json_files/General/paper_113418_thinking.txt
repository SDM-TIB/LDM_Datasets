To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RePFormer: Refinement Pyramid Transformer for Robust Facial Landmark Detection" by Jinpeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on four facial landmark detection benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this as a starting point.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they used, which are:

1. **WFLW**: This dataset is referenced as a popular benchmark for facial landmark detection. I will need to find the full citation in the references section.
2. **300W**: Another well-known dataset for facial landmark localization, which is also mentioned in the experiments.
3. **AFLW-Full**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the experiments, and I will look for its citation.
4. **COFW**: This dataset is included in the experiments as well, and I will ensure to find its citation.

After identifying these datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **WFLW**, the citation is:
  > Wenyan Wu, Chen Qian, Shuo Yang, Quan Wang, Yici Cai, and Qiang Zhou. *Look at boundary: A boundary-aware face alignment algorithm*. In CVPR, 2018.

- For **300W**, the citation is:
  > Christos Sagonas, Georgios Tzimiropoulos, Stefanos Zafeiriou, and Maja Pantic. *300 faces in-the-wild challenge: The first facial landmark localization challenge*. In ICCV Workshops, 2013.

- For **AFLW-Full**, the citation is:
  > Martin Koestinger, Paul Wohlhart, Peter M. Roth, and Horst Bischof. *Annotated facial landmarks in the wild: A large-scale, real-world database for facial landmark localization*. In Workshop on BeFIT, 2011.

- For **COFW**, the citation is:
  > Xavier P. Burgos-Artizzu, Pietro Perona, and Piotr Doll√°r. *Robust face landmark estimation under occlusion*. In ICCV, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
