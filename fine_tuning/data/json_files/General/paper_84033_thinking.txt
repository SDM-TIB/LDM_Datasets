To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Deep Learning Approach for Analyzing the Composition of Chemometric Data" by Muhammad Bilal and Mohib Ullah, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed technique on **orange juice and wine datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they specify:

1. **Orange Juice Dataset**: This dataset is used to determine sugar content through near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. It consists of 149 training samples and 67 test samples, with 700 spectral variables representing absorbance values between 1100 nm and 2500 nm. The sugar concentration ranges from 0% to 95.2% by weight.

2. **Wine Dataset**: This dataset is used to determine alcohol content via mid-infrared spectroscopy. It contains 91 training samples and 30 test samples, with 256 spectral variables representing absorbance values at wave numbers between 4000 and 400 cmâˆ’1. The alcohol content varies from 7.48% to 15.5% by volume.

The authors also mention that no preprocessing was performed on these datasets, which is important for understanding the context of the results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The paper cites a reference for the spectrophotometric samples used in the analysis:

- For the **orange juice and wine datasets**, the citation is:
  > Marc Meurens. *Spectrophotometric samples of orange juice and wine for chemometric analysis*. [Online]. Available: [Link or DOI if available].

Since the paper does not provide a specific publication year or additional details for the datasets, I will note that the citation is based on the information provided in the references.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or documentation.
