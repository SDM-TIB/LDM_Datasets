To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Low-Cost, Controllable and Interpretable Task-Oriented Chatbot: With Real-World After-Sale Services as Example" by Xiangyu Xi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by traditional task-oriented dialogue systems, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the experiments and data collection.

In **section 3 (Industrial Application)**, the authors mention that they sampled **50,000 utterances from the corpus** and grouped them into **100 clusters**. This indicates that they used a dataset of dialogues for their experiments, but I need to find the source or citation for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset they used. The references include various works, but I need to identify which ones pertain to the dataset of dialogues or utterances.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors refer to a previous work by **Chenxu Lv et al. (2021)** titled "Task-Oriented Clustering for Dialogues," which likely discusses the methodology for clustering dialogues and may provide insights into the dataset used.

The citation for this work is:
> Chenxu Lv, Hengtong Lu, Shuyu Lei, Huixing Jiang, Wei Wu, Caixia Yuan, and Xiaojie Wang. *Task-Oriented Clustering for Dialogues*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 4338â€“4347. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.368

Additionally, the authors mention using a **BERT-based model** for text similarity, which implies they might have used a dataset related to BERT training or fine-tuning. However, this is more about the methodology rather than a specific dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The main dataset identified is the large-scale dialogue corpus used for clustering and constructing the TaskFlow.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each entry includes the necessary details and citations.
