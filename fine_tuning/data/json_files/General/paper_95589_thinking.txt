To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Which Minimizer Does My Neural Network Converge To?" by Manuel Nonnenmacher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on different datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 7) in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

In Section 7, the authors mention conducting experiments on three datasets: **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR10**. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their specific roles in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete context for each dataset used in the research.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the Fashion-MNIST dataset is:
   > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
