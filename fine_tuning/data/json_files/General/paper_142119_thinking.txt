To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anomaly Correction of Business Processes Using Transformer Autoencoder" by Ziyou Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several real-life event logs, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the experimental data and setup. Here, they mention using four real-life event log datasets from different domains, specifically:

1. **BPIC2012W**: This dataset contains 9,658 traces with 6 distinct activities, an average case length of 7, and a maximum case length of 79.
2. **BPIC2012**: This dataset has 13,087 traces, 24 activities, an average case length of 20, and a maximum case length of 175.
3. **BPIC2013in**: This dataset includes 7,554 traces, 7 activities, an average case length of 8, and a maximum case length of 123.
4. **BPIC2017**: This dataset consists of 31,509 traces, 26 activities, an average case length of 38, and a maximum case length of 180.

The authors also provide a link to where these datasets can be accessed: 4TU.ResearchData (https://data.4tu.nl/).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are from a specific repository (4TU.ResearchData), they may not have traditional citations like journal articles. Instead, I will note the repository and the datasets as follows:

- **BPIC2012W**: Available at 4TU.ResearchData.
- **BPIC2012**: Available at 4TU.ResearchData.
- **BPIC2013in**: Available at 4TU.ResearchData.
- **BPIC2017**: Available at 4TU.ResearchData.

Since the datasets are part of a collection, I will reference the repository as the source for all datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names, descriptions, and citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
