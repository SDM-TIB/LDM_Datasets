To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TnT Attacks! Universal Naturalistic Adversarial Patches Against Deep Neural Network Systems" by Bao Gia Doan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **ImageNet dataset** and evaluated their method across multiple visual classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly state that they used the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with a million high-resolution images used for training state-of-the-art deep perception models. The goal is to recognize visual scenes among 1,000 different classes.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for scene classification tasks, consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with images of size 32 Ã— 32.

3. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: This dataset includes 43 different traffic sign classes and is commonly used to evaluate vulnerabilities of deep neural networks.

4. **PubFig**: A face recognition dataset containing images of public figures, with a total of 48,498 images used for training and 12,322 for testing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > O. Russakovsky et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. "Cifar-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)."

- For **GTSRB**:
  > J. Stallkamp et al. "Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition." *Neural Networks*, 2012.

- For **PubFig**:
  > O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, and A. Zisserman. "Deep face recognition." In *British Machine Vision Conference*, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
