To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determinants of Hotels and Restaurants entrepreneurship: A study using GEM data" by Antonio Rafael Ramos-Rodríguez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses data from the **Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)** project, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors mention that the data comes from **121,218 interviews** with adults aged 18-64 collected during spring 2008 in countries participating in the GEM project. They also note that due to missing data, only **33,711 respondents** were included in the final sample. This information is crucial as it provides context about the dataset's size and the demographic it covers.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the GEM dataset. The authors reference the GEM project in their methodology, specifically citing Reynolds et al. (2005) for details about the procedures used to collect and harmonize the data. 

The citation for the GEM dataset is:
> Reynolds, P.D.; Bosma, N.; Autio, E.; Hunt, S.; De Bono, N.; Servais, I.; Lopez-Garcia, P. and Chin, N. (2005). “Global Entrepreneurship Monitor: Data collection design and implementation 1998-2003”. *Small Business Economics*, 24, 205-231.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) Dataset**: This dataset includes responses from **121,218 interviews** with adults aged 18-64 from various countries, collected in spring 2008. The final analysis was based on **33,711 respondents** due to missing data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the GEM dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.
