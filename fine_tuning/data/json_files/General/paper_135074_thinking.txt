To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Transformer-Based Segmentation for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Auto-Augmentation and Search Optimisation Techniques" by Leon Hamnett et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the methodology is validated on breast cancer histology slides, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset preparation and preprocessing)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments:

1. **Breast Cancer Histology Slides (BCS)**: The dataset consists of 151 images of histology slides, each paired with a corresponding segmentation mask. The images are provided in .png format and have a resolution of 0.25 microns/pixel. The dataset has a total memory size of 4.59 GB and includes various pixel dimensions.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance metrics achieved using this dataset, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous work that generated the dataset:

- For the **Breast Cancer Histology Slides (BCS)**, the citation is:
  > Mohamed Amgad, Habiba Elfandy, Hagar Hussein, et al. *Structured crowdsourcing enables convolutional segmentation of histology images*. Bioinformatics, 35(18):3461â€“3467, 2019. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz083.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
