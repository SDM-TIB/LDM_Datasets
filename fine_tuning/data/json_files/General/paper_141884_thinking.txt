To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Not All Contexts Are Equal: Teaching LLMs Credibility-aware Generation" by Ruotong Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the construction of a comprehensive benchmark covering three critical real-world scenarios, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Credibility-aware Generation Benchmark)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. They mention several datasets across different scenarios:

1. **HotpotQA**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering that requires reasoning across multiple documents. The authors note that it has a high proportion of distracting documents.

2. **2WikiMHQA**: Another multi-hop question answering dataset that also features a significant amount of noise.

3. **MuSiQue**: A dataset that presents questions of higher complexity, with a high noise ratio.

4. **ASQA**: A long-format QA dataset focused on ambiguous questions.

5. **RGB**: A specialized benchmark for evaluating models in the RAG scenario.

6. **EvolvingTempQA**: A dataset constructed for time-sensitive question answering, annotated with credibility information.

7. **NewsPollutedQA**: A dataset designed to tackle misinformation in question answering, containing both real and fake news.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized these datasets to evaluate their proposed model, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For **HotpotQA**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
