To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval Head Mechanistically Explains Long-Context Factuality" by Wenhao Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the investigation of long-context language models and their retrieval capabilities, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction mentions various model families and their capabilities but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed. In this section, the authors describe their methodology and the types of tests conducted, including the "Needle-in-a-Haystack" test. However, I need to check if they mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments**, I find that the authors synthesized an extractive QA dataset from up-to-date news articles. They mention that they extracted paragraphs and generated question-answer pairs using GPT-4, but they do not provide a formal name for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily list papers and technical reports related to the models and methods discussed, but they do not provide specific dataset citations.

Since the paper does not provide formal names or citations for any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Extractive QA Dataset**: This dataset was synthesized from news articles, where paragraphs were extracted, and question-answer pairs were generated using GPT-4. However, no formal citation is provided for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I note the lack of formal citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will help in understanding the context and limitations of the dataset references in this research.
