To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "6th Place Solution to Google Universal Image Embedding" by Socratis Gkelios et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract indicates that a diverse dataset was created based on the competition's categories, which suggests that multiple datasets may be referenced.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of the Google Universal Image Embedding competition, emphasizing the need to assemble their dataset. This hints at the importance of datasets in their approach.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they explored and used for their solution. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **Google LandmarksV2**: This dataset is referenced as a large-scale benchmark for instance-level recognition and retrieval.
2. **Products10k**: A large-scale product recognition dataset.
3. **Food-101**: A dataset for food image classification.
4. **iMaterialist**: Although it does not contain instance labels, the authors created additional labeled images from this dataset.
5. **Fashion200k**: A dataset related to fashion items.
6. **DeepFashion**: Another dataset for clothing recognition.
7. **RP2K**: A retail product dataset for fine-grained image classification.
8. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for car image classification.
9. **Stanford Online Products**: A dataset for product recognition.
10. **MET Artwork dataset**: A dataset for instance-level recognition of artworks.
11. **Storefronts-1461**: A dataset related to storefront images.

The authors also mention that they assembled a dataset of approximately 655k images from these categories, which indicates the scale of their data collection efforts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations I will look for include:

- For **Storefronts-1461**:
  > This dataset is referenced as a Kaggle dataset, and I will need to find the specific citation from the provided link.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed according to the paper's content.
