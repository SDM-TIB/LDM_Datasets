To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Augmentation and Dual Enhancement for Occluded Person Re-Identification" by Zi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on **three widely used occluded datasets and two non-occluded datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically provide specifics about the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they mention comparing their method with state-of-the-art occluded Re-ID methods on **Occluded-Duke, Partial-REID, and Occluded-ReID** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for a **dedicated section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. The authors explicitly state that their method was evaluated on the following datasets:

1. **Occluded-Duke**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

2. **Partial-REID**: Another dataset mentioned in the context of performance evaluation, indicating its significance in the experiments.

3. **Occluded-ReID**: This dataset is also highlighted as part of the evaluation process.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will consult the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Occluded-Duke**, the citation is:
  > Jiaxu Miao, Yu Wu, Ping Liu, Yuhang Ding, and Yi Yang. *Pose-guided feature alignment for occluded person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 542–551.

- For **Partial-REID**, the citation is:
  > Wei-Shi Zheng, Xiang Li, Tao Xiang, Shengcai Liao, Jianhuang Lai, and Shaogang Gong. *Partial person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, pp. 4678–4686.

- For **Occluded-ReID**, the citation is:
  > Jiaxuan Zhuo, Zeyu Chen, Jianhuang Lai, and Guangcong Wang. *Occluded person re-identification*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME), 2018, pp. 1–6.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
