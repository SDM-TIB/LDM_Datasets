To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Process for Adapting Language Models to Society (PALMS) with Values-Targeted Datasets" by Irene Solaiman and Christy Dennison, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a "values-targeted dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the steps involved in creating the values-targeted dataset. They mention that they crafted a dataset consisting of 80 text answers to prompts designed to reflect desired behaviors. This section provides insight into the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3.4 (Dataset Completion Creation)**, the authors detail how they wrote completions for the prompts, ensuring adherence to the desired behavior. They refer to this collection of completions as the "values-targeted dataset." 

Additionally, I will look for any references to control datasets used for comparison. In **section 3.6.2 (Control Dataset)**, the authors describe a control dataset containing 100 snippets from a private corpus of books and Wikipedia articles, which were not selected to reflect any particular stance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The values-targeted dataset is not attributed to a specific external source, as it is a custom dataset created by the authors. However, the control dataset references general sources:

1. **Values-Targeted Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and does not have a formal citation since it is not published externally.

2. **Control Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the control dataset, as it consists of snippets from a private corpus of books and Wikipedia articles.

Since the values-targeted dataset is a novel contribution of this research, I will note that it is an original dataset created for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations as required.
