To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Positional Encoding on Length Generalization in Transformers" by Amirhossein Kazemnejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on positional encoding and its impact on length generalization, but it may not specify datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the challenges of length generalization in Transformer models but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **experimental section**, I will look for a subsection that details the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several tasks and datasets in the **Model Evaluation** section. Specifically, they refer to classical length generalization datasets such as **SCAN** and **PCFG**.

1. **SCAN Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model's ability to generalize across different lengths. It is a benchmark for assessing compositional generalization in neural networks.

2. **PCFG Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a classical length generalization benchmark. It is used to evaluate the model's performance on parsing tasks.
   - Citation: Hupkes, D., Dankers, V., Mul, M., & Bruni, E. (2020). Compositionality decomposed: How do neural networks generalize? Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 67, 757-795.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for these datasets, ready for further processing or review.
