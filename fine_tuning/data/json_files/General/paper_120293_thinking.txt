To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Visual Computing with Camera RAW Snapshots" by Zhihao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework for processing RAW images, which suggests that datasets related to RAW images might be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the lack of sufficient RAW image datasets and the development of a labeled MultiRAW dataset containing over 7,000 RAW images. This is a clear indication that a dataset is explicitly named.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any additional datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention using the MultiRAW dataset, which is described in detail in Table 1. This table provides specific information about the dataset, including the number of images, the types of cameras used, and the various settings.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MultiRAW dataset is described as follows:

- **MultiRAW Dataset**: A dataset containing 7,208 RAW images captured by four different camera sensors with diverse settings (e.g., Bayer pattern, bit depth) and different application scenarios.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **MultiRAW Dataset**:
   - Description: A labeled dataset containing over 7,000 RAW images acquired using multiple different camera sensors, designed for RAW-domain processing.
   - Citation: The dataset is not attributed to a specific paper in the references, but it is mentioned that it will be made publicly accessible for reproducible research.

Next, I will ensure that I have the correct citation format for the paper itself, which is crucial for proper attribution. The citation for the paper is:
> Zhihao Li, Ming Lu, Xu Zhang, Xin Feng, M. Salman Asif, and Zhan Ma. *Efficient Visual Computing with Camera RAW Snapshots*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset extraction process and prepare to present the findings in the required format, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
