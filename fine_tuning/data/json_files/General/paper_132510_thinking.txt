To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation" by Shahul Es et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the RAGAS framework but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the need for evaluation frameworks, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Evaluation Strategies** section, where the authors describe the metrics and methods used for evaluation. Here, I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized in their experiments.

In **section 4 (The WikiEval Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention the creation of a new dataset called **WikiEval**. They describe how this dataset was constructed, including the selection of Wikipedia pages and the generation of question-context-answer triples. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its purpose and the methodology used to create it.

The authors also mention that WikiEval is available on Hugging Face, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. I will note down the specific URL provided for accessing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiEval dataset. Since the dataset is newly created by the authors, I will use the citation format they follow in the paper.

The citation for the WikiEval dataset is:
> Shahul Es, Jithin James, Luis Espinosa-Anke, and Steven Schockaert. *WikiEval: A Dataset for Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/explodinggradients/WikiEval.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for WikiEval, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
