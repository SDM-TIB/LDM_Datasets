To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Classifiers in Detecting 419 Scams in Bilingual Cybercriminal Communities" by Alex V Mbaziira et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention a publicly leaked set of 1036 email addresses of Nigerian cybercriminals, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context. They also detail how the data was collected and the types of scams associated with these email addresses.

In this section, the authors describe two primary datasets generated from the email records:
1. **Primary Dataset 1 (PD1)**: Contains English-only records.
2. **Primary Dataset 2 (PD2)**: Contains half of the records in English and the other half in Nigerian Pidgin.

Additionally, they mention the creation of four sub-datasets based on these primary datasets:
- **Sub-dataset A**: English unigram words.
- **Sub-dataset B**: English bigram words.
- **Sub-dataset C**: Unigram words in both English and Nigerian Pidgin.
- **Sub-dataset D**: Bigram words in both English and Nigerian Pidgin.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a previous paper for the dataset construction, which is important for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> H. Sarvari, E. Abozinadah, A. Mbaziira, and D. McCoy. "Constructing and Analyzing Criminal Networks." IEEE Secur. Priv. Workshop, p. 8, 2014.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I provide a clear and concise summary for each.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset as required.
