To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FinGPT-HPC: Efficient Pretraining and Finetuning Large Language Models for Financial Applications" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of specific datasets for pretraining and finetuning, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **Section VI (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **OpenWebText**: This dataset is used for pretraining and is described as a clone of the GPT-2 WebText dataset, containing approximately 11.2 billion tokens.

2. **Alpaca Dataset**: This dataset is constructed using the self-instruct method and is used for finetuning. It contains 52,000 instruction-following examples.

3. **FinGPT Dataset**: Collected from financial websites, this dataset is also used for finetuning and contains 52,000 instruction-following examples.

For evaluation, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **BoolQ**: A question-answering dataset with 16,000 examples, where each example consists of a passage, question, and answer.

2. **PIQA**: A dataset for physical commonsense reasoning with 21,000 examples, each containing a question and two possible solutions.

3. **WinoGrande**: A commonsense reasoning dataset with 44,000 sentences, where each sentence has a blank to be filled.

4. **FPB**: This dataset consists of 4,800 sentences from financial news categorized by sentiment.

5. **FiQA SA**: Comprising 17,000 sentences from microblog headlines and financial news, classified according to sentiment.

6. **TFNS**: This dataset consists of 11,900 sentences from an annotated corpus of finance-related tweets, used for sentiment classification.

7. **NER**: A dataset consisting of 1,400 sentences from financial agreements, used for named entity recognition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
