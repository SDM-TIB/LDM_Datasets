To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Perceptual Quality by Phone-Fortified Perceptual Loss using Wasserstein Distance for Speech Enhancement" by Tsun-An Hsieh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on the **Voice Bank–DEMAND dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for understanding the experimental results.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1**, the authors provide a description of the **Voice Bank–DEMAND dataset**. They mention that it consists of utterances recorded by 28 speakers, with noisy mixtures synthesized using various types of noise at different SNR levels. This section confirms that the dataset is used for evaluation and provides context on how it was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Voice Bank–DEMAND dataset**. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Voice Bank corpus**:
  > C. Veaux, J. Yamagishi, and S. King. *The voice bank corpus: Design, collection and data analysis of a large regional accent speech database*. In Proceedings of O-COCOSDA/CASLRE, 2013.

- For the **DEMAND dataset**:
  > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. *Demand: a collection of multi-channel recordings of acoustic noise in diverse environments*. In Proceedings of Meetings Acoust, 2013.

Although the paper primarily focuses on the **Voice Bank–DEMAND dataset**, it is important to note that the authors reference both datasets in their work.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
