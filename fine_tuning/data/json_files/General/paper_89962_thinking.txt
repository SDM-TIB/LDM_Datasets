To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metric-Scale Truncation-Robust Heatmaps for 3D Human Pose Estimation" by István Sárándi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they discuss two major datasets:

1. **Human3.6M (H36M)**: This dataset is described as being captured with multiple cameras in a motion capture studio, and it has established evaluation protocols. The authors provide details about the training and testing subjects, as well as the evaluation metrics used.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP (3DHP)**: This dataset includes various scenes and subjects, and the authors mention specific adjustments made to the joint labels for comparison with other datasets. They also discuss the challenges posed by this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Ionescu, C., Li, F., & Sminchisescu, C. (2014). Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments. *PAMI*.

- For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > Mehta, D., Rhodin, H., Casas, D., Fua, P., Sotnychenko, O., Xu, W., & Theobalt, C. (2017). Monocular 3D human pose estimation in the wild using improved CNN supervision. In *3DV*.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
