To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Certification of Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Segmentation" by Othmane Laousy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five public datasets related to chest X-rays, skin lesions, and colonoscopies. This suggests that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **JSRT Dataset**: This dataset contains 247 chest X-ray images with annotations for lung, heart, and clavicles.
2. **Montgomery Dataset**: This dataset consists of 138 annotated chest X-ray images specifically for lung segmentation.
3. **Shenzen Dataset**: This dataset includes 662 annotated chest X-ray images, also for lung segmentation.
4. **ISIC 2018 Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,694 RGB dermatoscopy images with annotations for skin lesions.
5. **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of colonoscopy images with annotations.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **JSRT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shiraishi, J., Katsuragawa, S., Ikezoe, J., Matsumoto, T., Kobayashi, T., Komatsu, K.i., Matsui, M., Fujita, H., Kodera, Y., Doi, K. (2000). Development of a digital image database for chest radiographs with and without a lung nodule: receiver operating characteristic analysis of radiologists’ detection of pulmonary nodules. *American Journal of Roentgenology*.

- For the **Montgomery Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jaeger, S., Candemir, S., Antani, S., Wáng, Y.X.J., Lu, P.X., Thoma, G. (2014). Two public chest x-ray datasets for computer-aided screening of pulmonary diseases. *Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery*.

- For the **Shenzen Dataset**, the citation is the same as the Montgomery Dataset since both are part of the same study.

- For the **ISIC 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N.C.F., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., Celebi, M.E., Dusza, S.W., Gutman, D.A., Helba, B., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, K., Marchetti, M.A., Kittler, H., Halpern, A. (2019). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). *CoRR*.

- For the **CVC-ClinicDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bernal, J., Sánchez, F.J., Fernández-Esparrach, G., Gil, D., Rodríguez, C., Vilariño, F. (2015). Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians. *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
