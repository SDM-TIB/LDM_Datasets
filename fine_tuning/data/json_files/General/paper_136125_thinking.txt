To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Multi-Distribution Learning" by Zihan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically provides specifics about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "CIFAR-10" dataset, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and clearly presented, ready for further processing or review.
