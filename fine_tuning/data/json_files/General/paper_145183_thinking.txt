To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements" by Dayal Singh Kalra and Maissam Barkeshli, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their experiments involving several datasets, specifically mentioning **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and WikiText-2**. This is a crucial step as it provides the names of the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will check the **experimental setup section** to gather more details about each dataset. The authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A standard image classification dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.
4. **WikiText-2**: A dataset for language modeling, consisting of 2 million tokens.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**:
  > Tiny ImageNet Challenge. *https://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/930.pdf*.

- For **WikiText-2**:
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017. URL: https://openreview.net/forum?id=Byj72udxe.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or analysis. Each dataset will be documented with its name, description, and full citation.
