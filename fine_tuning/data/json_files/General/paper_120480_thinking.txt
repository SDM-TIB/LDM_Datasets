To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PairReranker: Pairwise Reranking for Natural Language Generation" by Dongfu Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on three NLG tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of pre-trained language models and mention the need for appropriate decoding methods. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (which is indicated in the paper) to identify the datasets used in their experiments. The paper lists three datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks and is constructed from articles on CNN and DailyMail websites. It is referenced as being used in prior works for machine reading and comprehension.

2. **CommonGen**: This dataset is utilized for generative commonsense reasoning and contains 79K commonsense descriptions. The authors mention that it is publicly available from Hugging Face.

3. **WMT18 (zh-en)**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for machine translation tasks, specifically for the Chinese-English translation. The authors also state that it is publicly available from Hugging Face.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomás Kociský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS, 2015.

- For **CommonGen**, the citation is:
  > Bill Yuchen Lin, Wangchunshu Zhou, Ming Shen, Pei Zhou, Chandra Bhagavatula, Yejin Choi, and Xiang Ren. *CommonGen: A constrained text generation challenge for generative commonsense reasoning*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020, pages 1823–1840, 2020.

- For **WMT18 (zh-en)**, the citation is:
  > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Federmann, Mark Fishel, Yvette Graham, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, and Christof Monz. *Findings of the 2018 conference on machine translation (wmt18)*. In Conference on Machine Translation, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
