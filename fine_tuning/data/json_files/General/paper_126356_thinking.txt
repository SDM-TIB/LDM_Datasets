To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error Analysis of Kernel/GP Methods for Nonlinear and Parametric PDEs" by Pau Batlle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but the introduction and numerical experiments sections are more likely to contain specific mentions of datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Gaussian processes and kernel methods in solving PDEs, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **numerical experiments section**, where the authors describe various experiments conducted to validate their methods.

In **Subsection 4.1 (High Dimensional PDEs)**, the authors mention using a variable coefficient nonlinear elliptic PDE with a specific ground truth solution. However, they do not refer to a dataset in the traditional sense, as they are generating data based on the PDE itself.

In **Subsection 4.2 (Parametric PDEs)**, the authors describe a parametric version of the Darcy flow problem and mention sampling points uniformly in the interior and boundary of the domain. They do not provide a specific dataset name but describe the sampling process.

In **Subsection 4.3 (High Dimensional HJB Equation)**, the authors discuss the use of a stochastic differential equation to represent the solution of the HJB equation. Again, they do not reference a specific dataset but describe the numerical methods used to generate solutions.

After reviewing these sections, it appears that the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets by name. Instead, the authors generate their own data through numerical simulations based on the PDEs they are studying.

Since there are no explicit datasets mentioned with citations, I will note that the authors primarily rely on generated data from their numerical experiments rather than external datasets. 

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Generated Data for High Dimensional PDEs**: The authors generate data based on a variable coefficient nonlinear elliptic PDE with a specific ground truth solution. No external dataset is cited.

2. **Generated Data for Parametric PDEs**: The authors sample points uniformly in the interior and boundary of the domain for the parametric Darcy flow problem. No external dataset is cited.

3. **Generated Data for High Dimensional HJB Equation**: The authors use a stochastic differential equation to generate data for the HJB equation. No external dataset is cited.

Since there are no datasets with full citations to provide, I will summarize that the research relies on generated data from numerical simulations rather than established datasets.
