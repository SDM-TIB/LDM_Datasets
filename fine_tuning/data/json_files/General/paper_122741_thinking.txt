To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Test-Time Distribution Normalization for Contrastively Learned Vision-language Models" by Yifei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on various downstream tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In particular, I will focus on any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the **Experiments** section, specifically in subsections related to cross-modal retrieval and zero-shot classification. The datasets identified are:

1. **MSCOCO**: A widely used dataset for image captioning and object detection, containing 118K images in its training split and over 5K images in its test split.
2. **Flickr30K**: A benchmark dataset for image captioning, consisting of 31K images, each with five reference sentences.
3. **ImageNet1K**: A well-known dataset for image classification, containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories.
4. **Cifar100**: A dataset with 100 classes of objects, each class having 500 training images and 100 test images.
5. **SUN397**: A scene recognition dataset with 899 categories and about 130K images.
6. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset dedicated to car classification, containing around 16K images of 196 car types.
7. **Caltech101**: An object recognition dataset with 101 categories and over 9,000 images.
8. **Flowers102**: A dataset focused on flowers, comprising 102 categories with over 8,000 images.
9. **Flickr8K-Expert**: A dataset containing 17K human ratings of image-caption pairs.
10. **Flickr8K-CF**: A dataset with 48K image-caption pairs and 145K binary ratings.
11. **THumb**: A dataset with 500 images, each having five candidate captions evaluated by human annotators.
12. **Pascal-50S**: A dataset containing 4K caption-caption pairs for evaluating caption quality.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
