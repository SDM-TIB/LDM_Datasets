To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advective Diffusion Transformers for Topological Generalization in Graph Learning" by Qitian Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they used. I will note down the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The paper describes synthetic datasets created to simulate graph data generation with varying topological shifts. These datasets are used to validate the model's performance under different conditions.

2. **Twitch Dataset**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks, where each node represents a user and edges indicate friendships. The dataset is split based on geographic regions.

3. **Arxiv Dataset**: This citation network dataset is used for node classification tasks, where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations. The dataset is split based on publication years.

4. **OGB-BACE and OGB-SIDER**: These datasets are used for molecular property prediction tasks, where each dataset contains molecular graphs with associated features.

5. **DDPIN Dataset**: This dataset consists of dynamic protein-protein interaction networks used for various predictive tasks, including node regression and link prediction.

6. **HAM Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating molecular mapping operators, which involves predicting how atoms are grouped in a molecule.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract include:

- For the **Twitch Dataset**:
  > Rozemberczki, B., Allen, C., & Sarkar, R. (2021). Multi-scale attributed node embedding. *Journal of Complex Networks*, 9(2).

- For the **Arxiv Dataset**:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

- For the **OGB-BACE and OGB-SIDER**:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Ren, H., Nakata, M., Dong, Y., & Leskovec, J. (2021). Ogb-lsc: A large-scale challenge for machine learning on graphs. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.09430.

- For the **DDPIN Dataset**:
  > Fu, D., & He, J. (2022). DDPIN: A biological repository of dynamic protein-protein interaction network data. In *2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)*.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
