To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-End Chinese Text Normalization Model Based on Rule-Guided Flat-Lattice Transformer" by Wenlin Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a "first publicly accessible large-scale dataset for Chinese text normalization," which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the significance of text normalization and mention the dataset's role in their experiments. They emphasize that their proposed model achieves excellent results on this dataset, which reinforces its importance.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, and the categories it includes. The authors mention that the dataset consists of 30,000 sentences extracted from Chinese Wikipedia, with an average length of 50 characters. They also describe a classification standard with 29 categories for non-standard words (NSWs).

The **experiments section** may provide additional context on how the dataset was utilized, including any train/test splits or evaluation metrics. The authors mention that they randomly separated the dataset into training, validation, and test sets at a ratio of 8:1:1, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly released and not attributed to a specific prior work, I will note the authors' statement about it being the first publicly accessible dataset for Chinese text normalization.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Chinese Text Normalization Dataset**: This dataset is the first large-scale open-source dataset for Chinese text normalization, containing 30,000 sentences with an average length of 50 characters. It includes 29 categories for non-standard words, which are crucial for the text normalization task.

Since the dataset is newly released and does not have a traditional citation, I will note the authors and the paper title as the reference for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the authors and the title of the paper as the citation for the dataset.
