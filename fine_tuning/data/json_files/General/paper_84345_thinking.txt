To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks via Adversarial Training with Triplet Loss" by Pengcheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical studies on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in the context of their research on adversarial training and robustness.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Cats vs. Dogs**: A large-scale image dataset used for binary classification problems.
2. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits commonly used for multi-class classification problems.
3. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Cats vs. Dogs**:
  > Elson, J., Douceur, J. J. D., Howell, J., & Saul, J. (2007). Asirra: a captcha that exploits interest-aligned manual image categorization. 

- For **MNIST**:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. Retrieved from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
