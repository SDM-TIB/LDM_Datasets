To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADCC: An Effective and Intelligent Attention Dense Color Constancy System for Studying Images in Smart Cities" by Yilang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that "simulations and experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective," indicating that datasets are used but not naming them yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Color Checker Dataset**: This dataset is reprocessed by Shi and Funt and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. It is used for evaluating the performance of the ADCC algorithm.

2. **NUS 8-Camera Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing images taken from eight different cameras, and it is also used for performance evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Color Checker Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Shi, D. K. Prasad, and M. S. Brown. *Re-processed version of color constancy dataset of 568 images*. Available: http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~colour/data/, 2000.

- For the **NUS 8-Camera Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Cheng, D. K. Prasad, and M. S. Brown. *Illuminant estimation for color constancy: Why spatial-domain methods work and the role of the color distribution*. Journal of the Optical Society of America A, vol. 31, no. 5, pp. 1049â€“1058, Apr. 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will now summarize the datasets:

1. **Color Checker Dataset**: A dataset containing 568 images used for evaluating color constancy algorithms.
2. **NUS 8-Camera Dataset**: A dataset consisting of images captured by eight different cameras, used for testing the performance of the ADCC algorithm.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
