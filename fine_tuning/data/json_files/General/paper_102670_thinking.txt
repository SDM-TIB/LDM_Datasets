To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hate-Speech Detection in Roman-Urdu" by Moin Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a hate-speech corpus for Roman Urdu, which suggests that there is a specific dataset created for this purpose.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, such as **Methodology** or **Corpus Annotation**. In this paper, the authors describe the process of creating a hate-speech corpus based on tweets. They mention that they scraped nearly 100,000 tweets and filtered them down to a final dataset of 5,000 tweets that were annotated for hate-speech detection.

In the **Corpus Annotation** section, the authors provide details about the dataset:
1. **Hate-Speech Corpus for Roman Urdu**: This dataset consists of 5,000 tweets that have been manually annotated into categories of neutral, offensive, and hate-speech. The authors describe the methodology used to create this dataset, including the scraping process and the guidelines developed for annotation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset is original and created by the authors, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the authors' own description of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset would be:
- **Hate-Speech Corpus for Roman Urdu**: Moin Khan, Khurram Shahzad, Kamran Malik. *Hate-Speech Detection in Roman-Urdu*. Punjab University College of Information Technology, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.
