To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ranking Info Noise Contrastive Estimation: Boosting Contrastive Learning via Ranked Positives" by David T. Hoffmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets mentioned in the paper, including their full citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction may provide context about the datasets used for experiments, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments in the **Experiments** section. Here, they refer to:

1. **Cifar-100**: This dataset is described as providing both class and superclass labels, which are used to define a semantic hierarchy for their experiments.

2. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset is noted as a smaller version of ImageNet, comprising 200 classes at low resolution.

3. **ImageNet-100**: This is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, consisting of 100 classes.

4. **Kinetics-400**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of unsupervised video representation learning, consisting of a large number of training videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Cifar-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report.

- For **TinyImageNet**:
  > Le, Y., & Yang, X. (2015). *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*.

- For **ImageNet-100**:
  > Tian, Y., Krishnan, D., & Isola, P. (2020). *Contrastive Multi-view Coding*. In ECCV.

- For **Kinetics-400**:
  > Kay, W., Carreira, J., Simonyan, K., et al. (2017). *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv, abs/1705.06950.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and its citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and ready for any further processing or review.
