To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Gender Classification and Age Estimation by Nearly Orthogonalizing Their Semantic Spaces" by Qing Tian and Songcan Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on three aging datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. They list three datasets:

1. **FG-NET Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,002 facial images captured from 82 individuals. The authors specify that they selected a subset of FG-NET with ages ranging from 0 to 36 years for their experiments.

2. **Morph Album I Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 1,690 facial images from about 631 individuals, with ages ranging from 16 to about 77 years. The authors mention that they selected a subset with ages ranging from 16 to 44 years.

3. **Morph Album II Dataset**: This is a larger dataset with over 55,000 images. The authors specifically used images of Caucasians aged between 16 and 60 years for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **FG-NET Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Guo, Y. Fu, C. R. Dyer, T. S. Huang. *Facial Age Estimation by Learning from Label Distributions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2013.

- For the **Morph Album I Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Lanitis, C. Draganova, C. Christodoulou. *Comparing Different Classifiers for Automatic Age Estimation*. Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on, 34(1):621-628, 2004.

- For the **Morph Album II Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Guo, G. Mu. *Joint Estimation of Age, Gender and Ethnicity: CCA vs. PLS*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG), 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
