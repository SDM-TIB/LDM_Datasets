To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalised Dice overlap as a deep learning loss function for highly unbalanced segmentations" by Carole H. Sudre et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of segmenting rare observations in medical images, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that might include datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experiments. Here, the authors describe the segmentation tasks they performed, which include tumor segmentation and segmentation of age-related white matter hyperintensities. I will look for any specific datasets used for these tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **BRATS dataset** for the 2D networks, which is a well-known dataset for brain tumor segmentation. They also refer to an **in-house dataset** of 524 subjects for the 3D segmentation task. I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **BRATS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Menze, B.H., et al. "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(10), 1993â€“2024, 2015.

2. The **in-house dataset** does not have a specific citation since it is not publicly available, but I will note that it consists of 524 subjects presenting age-related white matter hyperintensities.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **BRATS Dataset**: A publicly available dataset used for brain tumor segmentation, which includes multimodal MRI scans.
- **In-house Dataset**: A proprietary dataset consisting of 524 subjects with age-related white matter hyperintensities, used for 3D segmentation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.
