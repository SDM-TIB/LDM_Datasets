To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sexism Detection on a Data Diet" by Rabiraj Bandyopadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe the creation of a training dataset by combining two datasets:

1. **EDOS (Explainable Detection of Online Sexism)**: This dataset is referenced as being created by Kirk et al. and is used for training the model.
2. **Call Me Sexist But**: This dataset is mentioned as another source for the training data.

The authors also mention using several out-of-domain datasets for evaluation:

3. **Hatecheck Dataset**: Specifically filtered for instances targeting women.
4. **EXIST Dataset**: Used for detecting online misogyny.
5. **Misogyny Dataset**: Comprising Reddit posts and comments aimed at detecting misogyny.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **EDOS Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
