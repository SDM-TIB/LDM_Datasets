To extract the datasets mentioned in the paper titled "GeLaTO: Generative Latent Textured Objects" by Ricardo Martin-Brualla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset of real images of eyeglasses frames, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Eyeglasses Frames Dataset**: The authors collected a dataset of 85 eyeglasses frames under different viewpoints and fixed illumination. This dataset is specifically designed to evaluate their approach due to the complexity of the eyeglasses' structures, including transparency and reflections.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: The authors also mention using the ShapeNet dataset, which is a well-known repository for 3D models that can be rendered under different viewpoints. They reference it as the de facto standard for evaluating category-level object reconstruction approaches.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Eyeglasses Frames Dataset**, since it is a dataset collected by the authors themselves, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as follows:
  > Martin-Brualla, R., Pandey, R., Bouaziz, S., Brown, M., & Goldman, D. B. (2023). *GeLaTO: Generative Latent Textured Objects*. Dataset of 85 eyeglasses frames collected for evaluation.

- For the **ShapeNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chang, A.X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Tech. Rep. arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
