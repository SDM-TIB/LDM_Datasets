To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ViM-UNet: Vision Mamba for Biomedical Segmentation" by Anwai Archit and Constantin Pape, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors compare their method to existing architectures for two microscopy instance segmentation tasks, suggesting that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Method and Experiments** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **LIVECell**: This dataset is used for cell segmentation in phase-contrast microscopy. The authors note that it contains small cells with diverse morphology and provide details about the training, validation, and test splits.

2. **CREMI**: This dataset is utilized for neurite segmentation in volume electron microscopy. The authors describe it as containing neurites of diverse sizes and specify that they restrict segmentation to 2D.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LIVECell**, the citation is:
  > Christoffer Edlund, Timothy R Jackson, Nabeel Khalid, Nicola Bevan, Timothy Dale, Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed, Johan Trygg, and Rickard Sjögren. *LIVECell—a large-scale dataset for label-free live cell segmentation*. Nature methods, 18(9):1038–1045, 2021. URL https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01249-6.

- For **CREMI**, the citation is:
  > Jan Funke, Stephan Saalfeld, Dabi Bock, Srini Turaga, and Eric Perlman. *CREMI: MICCAI challenge on circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images*, 2016. URL https://cremi.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
