To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Focal Loss: Generalising Dice and Cross Entropy-based Losses to Handle Class Imbalanced Medical Image Segmentation" by Michael Yeung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their proposed loss function on five publicly available, class-imbalanced medical imaging datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the five datasets:

1. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset consists of 612 frames containing colorectal polyps, generated from 23 video sequences from 13 different patients using standard colonoscopy interventions. The image resolution is 288 × 384 pixels.

2. **DRIVE**: The DRIVE dataset includes 40 colored fundus photographs obtained from diabetic retinopathy screening in the Netherlands. The resolution of the images is 768 × 584 pixels.

3. **Breast Ultrasound 2017 (BUS2017)**: This dataset contains 163 ultrasound images with associated ground truth segmentations. The mean image size is 760 × 570 pixels, and it includes both benign and cancerous lesions.

4. **Brain Tumour Segmentation 2020 (BraTS20)**: The BraTS20 dataset comprises 494 multimodal scans of patients with gliomas, with images manually annotated for various tumor regions. The dataset focuses on gadolinium-enhancing tumor segmentation.

5. **Kidney Tumour Segmentation 2019 (KiTS19)**: This dataset consists of 300 arterial phase abdominal CT scans from patients who underwent partial or complete removal of kidney tumors. The image size is 512 × 512 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
