To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new recurrent neural network based predictive model for Faecal Calprotectin analysis: A retrospective study" by Zeeshan Khawar Malik et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a retrospective analysis of **804 patients**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **Section II (Calprotectin Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset comprises records of **804 patients** provided by the Western General Hospital's Gastroenterology Unit. They also note that the dataset includes **53 independent variables** after preprocessing, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. However, the primary dataset discussed in this paper appears to be the **Calprotectin dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from a specific hospital's records, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. However, I will note the source as follows:

- **Calprotectin Dataset**: The dataset is derived from records of patients at the Western General Hospital's Gastroenterology Unit, Edinburgh, UK. It is not formally published as a standalone dataset but is referenced in the context of this study.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, I have identified the **Calprotectin dataset** as the primary dataset used in this study, and I have noted its source. I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
