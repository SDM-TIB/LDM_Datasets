To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMOM: Adaptive Masking over Masking for Conditional Masked Language Model" by Yisheng Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "3 different tasks (neural machine translation, summarization, and code generation) with 15 datasets in total." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Datasets** subsection, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of tasks).

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **IWSLT Datasets**: The authors state that they conducted experiments on IWSLT datasets, which contain 170,000 pairs for various language pairs. However, the specific datasets used within IWSLT are not detailed in this section.

2. **WMT Datasets**: The authors mention using WMT datasets, specifically WMT16 English→Romanian and WMT14 English→German, with 0.6 million and 4.5 million pairs, respectively. This provides clear information about the datasets used for neural machine translation tasks.

3. **XSUM Dataset**: For the summarization task, the authors refer to the XSUM dataset, which contains 204,045 training articles and corresponding summaries. This dataset is well-defined and relevant for the summarization task.

4. **Py150 Dataset**: For the code generation task, the authors mention using the Py150 dataset, which is a well-known dataset for code completion tasks.

5. **GitHub-Java Dataset**: The authors also refer to the GitHub-Java dataset, which is used for code generation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **IWSLT datasets**, the citation is:

- For the **XSUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Don't Give Me the Details, Just the Summary! Topic-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Extreme Summarization*. In EMNLP 2018.

- For the **Py150 dataset**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
