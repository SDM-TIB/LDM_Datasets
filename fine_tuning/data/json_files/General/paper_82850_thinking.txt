To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Linear Bandits with Hidden Low Rank Structure" by Sahin Lale et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed algorithm on various image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the use of deep neural networks and mentions adapting image classification tasks, indicating that specific datasets are likely referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about each dataset, including their characteristics and how they are utilized in the context of the research.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit recognition tasks. The authors mention modifying the architecture of a neural network to generate decision sets for the SLB framework based on MNIST.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The authors adapt this dataset similarly to MNIST for their experiments.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset contains millions of images across thousands of categories. The authors use it to create decision sets for the SLB framework, emphasizing the complexity of the task due to the large number of classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2012.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and attributed in accordance with academic standards.
