To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REX: Revisiting Budgeted Training with an Improved Schedule" by John Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly list datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors detail their experimental settings. Here, they mention several datasets used for training and evaluation. Specifically, I will look for tables or figures that summarize the datasets and their characteristics.

In **Table 3**, the authors list the experimental settings, which include the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 14 million images across thousands of categories.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **STL10**: A dataset for image classification that includes 10 classes, with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.
5. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
6. **Pascal VOC**: A dataset used for object detection, containing images with annotated objects across 20 categories.
7. **GLUE**: A benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding systems, consisting of multiple datasets for various NLP tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, the citations I will look for might include:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Pascal VOC**:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010.

- For **GLUE**:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, et al. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
