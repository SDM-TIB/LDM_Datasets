To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anchor-free Oriented Proposal Generator for Object Detection" by Gong Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the release of a new dataset called **DIOR-R**, which is a strong indication that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **DIOR-R**: This is a new dataset created by annotating oriented bounding boxes for objects in the existing DIOR dataset. It contains 23,463 images and 192,512 instances across 20 common classes.

2. **DOTA**: This dataset is described as a large-scale aerial object detection dataset containing 2,806 images and 188,282 instances of 15 common object classes.

3. **HRSC2016**: This dataset is a challenging ship detection dataset that includes 1,061 images, with varying sizes, used for training and evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **DIOR-R**, the citation is:
  > Gong Cheng, Jiabao Wang, Ke Li, Xingxing Xie, Chunbo Lang, Yanqing Yao, and Junwei Han. *Anchor-free Oriented Proposal Generator for Object Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

- For **DOTA**, the citation is:
  > G.-S. Xia, X. Bai, J. Ding, Z. Zhu, S. Belongie, J. Luo, M. Datcu, M. Pelillo, and L. Zhang. *DOTA: A Large-Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2018.

- For **HRSC2016**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, H. Wang, L. Weng, and Y. Yang. *Ship Rotated Bounding Box Space for Ship Extraction from High-Resolution Optical Satellite Images with Complex Backgrounds*. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 13, no. 8, pp. 1074â€“1078, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
