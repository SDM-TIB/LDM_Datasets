To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coreferential Reasoning Learning for Language Representation" by Deming Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various downstream NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will carefully review the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will pay particular attention to subsections like **4.2 Extractive Question Answering**, **4.3 Relation Extraction**, **4.4 Fact Extraction and Verification**, and **4.5 Coreference Resolution**. Each of these subsections may contain references to specific datasets used in the experiments.

In **section 4.2**, the authors mention using the **QUOREF dataset** for extractive question answering, which is specifically designed to test coreferential reasoning. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In **section 4.3**, the authors refer to the **DocRED dataset**, which is used for document-level relation extraction. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

In **section 4.4**, the authors discuss the **FEVER dataset**, which is utilized for fact extraction and verification. I will document the specifics of this dataset as mentioned in the paper.

In **section 4.5**, the authors evaluate their model on several coreference resolution datasets, including **GAP**, **DPR**, **WSC**, and **Winogender**. I will gather information about these datasets as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
