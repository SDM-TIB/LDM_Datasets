To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lottery Tickets in Evolutionary Optimization: On Sparse Backpropagation-Free Trainability" by Robert Tjarko Lange and Henning Sprekeler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the lottery ticket phenomenon in the context of evolutionary optimization, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Winning Lottery Ticket Initializations Exist for Evolutionary Optimization)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention evaluating their approach on **12 tasks** across different network architectures and evolutionary strategies. However, they do not provide specific dataset names in this section.

I will then check **section 4 (ES-Based Lottery Tickets Transfer across Tasks, ES and to GD-Based Training)**, where the authors discuss the transferability of their findings across different tasks and settings. They mention tasks like **Ant control** and **MNIST variants**, but again, specific datasets are not named.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations that might refer to datasets used in their experiments. The authors reference several papers, but I need to determine if any of these papers are associated with datasets relevant to their work.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors mention using the **Brax package** for their control tasks, which is a differentiable physics engine. However, they do not provide a specific dataset citation for the tasks they evaluated.

To summarize, while the paper discusses various tasks and methodologies, it does not explicitly name any datasets or provide full citations for them. Therefore, I will note that the datasets used in the experiments are not clearly defined in the paper, and I will document this finding accordingly.

In conclusion, I will compile my findings, noting the absence of specific dataset names and citations in the paper, while also mentioning the tasks and methodologies discussed. This will help in understanding the context of the research without having specific datasets to reference.
