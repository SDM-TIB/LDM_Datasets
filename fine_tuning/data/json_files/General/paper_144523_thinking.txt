To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAP: A Context-Aware Neural Predictor for NAS" by Han Ji, Yuqi Feng, and Yanan Sun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the CAP method evaluates architectures in **NAS-Bench-101** and **DARTS** search spaces, indicating that these are datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **NAS-Bench-101** search space as containing over 423,000 unique neural architectures, providing validation and test accuracy for CNNs on CIFAR-10. This is a clear dataset description.

Similarly, in the same section, the **NAS-Bench-201** search space is mentioned, which consists of over 15,000 different neural architectures and provides detailed results on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet16-120. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant.

In section 4.3, the authors discuss the use of the **DARTS** search space, which is built from normal and reduction cells, further confirming its relevance as a dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For **NAS-Bench-101**, the citation is:
   > Ying, C., Klein, A., Christiansen, E., Real, E., Murphy, K., & Hutter, F. (2019). *NAS-Bench-101: Towards Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2019.

2. For **NAS-Bench-201**, the citation is:
   > Dong, X., & Yang, Y. (2019). *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

3. For **DARTS**, the citation is:
   > Liu, H., Simonyan, K., & Yang, Y. (2018). *DARTS: Differentiable Architecture Search*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed to its source. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper effectively.
