To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Learning from Low-labelled Stream Data in Open-Set Video Face Recognition" by Eric Lopez-Lopez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a novel incremental learning approach for identifying individuals from streaming face data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Preliminaries)**, where the authors discuss the databases used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **CMU Face in Action (FiA) Database**: This dataset contains 20-second videos of over 200 individuals simulating a passport checking scenario. The authors specify that they used videos from the smaller focal length of the frontal camera, focusing on 70 identities present in all sessions.

2. **COX Face Database**: This dataset is designed for video-surveillance and includes 1000 different identities. The authors describe how they organized the data into different sets for their experiments, including initially labelled sequences and operational sequences.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **CMU Face in Action (FiA) Database**, the citation is:
  > Goh, R., Liu, L., Liu, X., & Chen, T. (2005). The CMU Face In Action (FIA) Database. In *Analysis and Modelling of Faces and Gestures* (pp. 255–263). Springer.

- For the **COX Face Database**, the citation is:
  > Huang, Z., Shan, S., Wang, R., Zhang, H., Lao, S., Kuerban, A., & Chen, X. (2015). A benchmark and comparative study of video-based face recognition on COX face database. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 24(12), 5967–5981.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive output that reflects the datasets utilized in the research.
