To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Individualized Risk Prognosis for Critical Care Patients: A Multi-task Gaussian Process Model" by Ahmed M. Alaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it discusses the development of a risk score, it does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context about the data used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for real-time risk assessment in critical care and mention the use of electronic health record (EHR) data. This suggests that the dataset is derived from EHRs, but I need to find specific details about the dataset.

Next, I will look into the **study subjects section** where the authors describe the cohort used for their experiments. They mention that the experiments were conducted on a heterogeneous cohort of **6,094 patients admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center** over a period of three years (March 2013 to March 2016). This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the dataset used in the study.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their proposed risk score based on the dataset. They do not introduce any new datasets but confirm the use of the EHR dataset from the Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from EHR data specific to the Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on internal EHR data from the medical center.

To summarize, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **EHR Dataset**: A dataset comprising records of **6,094 patients** admitted to the Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center from March 2013 to March 2016. This dataset includes both time-varying physiological data and static admission information.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset in the references, I will note that it is based on internal data from the Ronald Reagan UCLA medical center.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
