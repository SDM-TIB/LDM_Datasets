To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Supervised and Semi-supervised Deep Probabilistic Models for Indoor Positioning Problems" by Weizhu Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted validation experiments on two real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. Here, they specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Tampere Dataset**: This dataset is used for indoor next location prediction. The authors describe it as having an input dimension of 489, with RSSI values ranging from -110 dB to 0 dB, and undetected WAPs set to 100. The target values are in meters.

2. **UJIIndoorLoc Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for location recognition via semi-supervised learning. The authors note that it has an input dimension of 520, with RSSI values ranging from -100 dB to 0 dB, and undetected WAPs set to 100. The coordinates are in longitudes and latitudes, and the total number of instances is about 20,000.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Tampere Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Elena Simona Lohan, Joaquín Torres-Sospedra, Helena Leppäkoski, Philipp Richter, Zhe Peng, and Joaquín Huerta. *Wi-Fi crowdsourced fingerprinting dataset for indoor positioning*. Data, 2(4):32, 2017.

- For the **UJIIndoorLoc Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joaquín Torres-Sospedra, Raúl Montoliu, Adolfo Martínez-Usó, Joan P Avariento, Tomás J Arnau, Mauri Benedito-Bordonau, and Joaquín Huerta. *UJIIndoorLoc: A new multi-building and multi-floor database for WLAN fingerprint-based indoor localization problems*. In 2014 International Conference on Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation (IPIN), pages 261–270. IEEE, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset as required.
