To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Matters: Data-Efficient Augmentation of Large Language Models for Scientific Applications" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions exploring challenges related to Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluating their performance using various benchmarks. This suggests that there may be datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections**. In section 4.2 (Data collection), the authors describe creating a question bank from a textbook on quantum mechanics, specifically citing **Griffiths and Schroeter (2018)** as the source of the selected problems. This indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is derived from this textbook.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the textbook is:
> David J. Griffiths and Darrell F. Schroeter. *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics*. Cambridge University Press, 2018.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the context of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs. The authors reference several benchmarks, including **AGIEval**, **ChemLLMBench**, and **SCIEval** in the introduction. I will need to find the full citations for these benchmarks as well.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations for the benchmarks:
- For **AGIEval**, the citation is:
  > Wanjun Zhong, Ruixiang Cui, Yiduo Guo, Yaobo Liang, Shuai Lu, Yanlin Wang, Amin Saied, Weizhu Chen, and Nan Duan. *AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.06364, 2023.

- For **ChemLLMBench**, the citation is:
  > Taicheng Guo, Kehan Guo, Bozhao Nan, Zhenwen Liang, Zhichun Guo, Nitesh V. Chawla, Olaf Wiest, and Xiangliang Zhang. *What Can Large Language Models Do in Chemistry? A Comprehensive Benchmark on Eight Tasks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.18365, 2023.

- For **SCIEval**, the citation is:
  > Liangtai Sun, Yang Han, Zihan Zhao, Da Ma, Zhennan Shen, Baocai Chen, Lu Chen, and Kai Yu. *SciEval: A Multi-Level Large Language Model Evaluation Benchmark for Scientific Research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.13149, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
