To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatEL: Entity Linking with Chatbots" by Yifan Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the ChatEL framework improves performance across **10 datasets**, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the statistics for the ten datasets used in their evaluation. This table includes the number of documents and mentions for each dataset, which is crucial information for understanding the datasets' scope.

In this section, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MSNBC (MSN)**: A dataset annotated from news articles, aiming to link entities in the news with a knowledge base.
2. **AQUAINT (AQU)**: Another news-based dataset for entity linking.
3. **ACE2004 (ACE04)**: A dataset that also focuses on linking entities from news sources.
4. **WNED-WIKI (WIKI)**: A large auto-extracted evaluation set developed from Wikipedia.
5. **WNED-CWEB (CWEB)**: Similar to WIKI, this dataset is auto-extracted from ClueWeb and Wikipedia.
6. **OKE-2015 (OKE15)**: A dataset customized for ontology completion on DBpedia.
7. **OKE-2016 (OKE16)**: Another dataset for ontology completion, similar to OKE15.
8. **N3-Reuters-128 (REU)**: A dataset that includes economic news from Reuters, manually annotated.
9. **N3-RSS-500 (RSS)**: A dataset using RSS feeds from global newspapers, also manually annotated.
10. **KORE50 (KORE)**: A dataset containing brief documents from microblogging platforms with ambiguous entity mentions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
