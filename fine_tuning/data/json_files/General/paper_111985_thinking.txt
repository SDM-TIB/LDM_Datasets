To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Prior Knowledge in Contrastive Learning with Kernel" by Benoit Dufumier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of generative models and weak attributes in the context of contrastive learning, which suggests that datasets related to these concepts may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in detail, which typically includes the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images of 200 bird species, with 312 binary attributes available. It is commonly used for fine-grained classification tasks.
   
2. **ImageNet100**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, containing 126,689 training images and 5,000 testing images, specifically chosen for its manageable size in experiments.

3. **UTZappos**: This dataset contains 50,025 images of shoes from various brands, categorized into 21 groups, and is used for weakly supervised learning tasks.

4. **CheXpert**: A dataset comprising 224,316 chest radiographs from 65,240 patients, with 14 medical observations associated with each image.

5. **BIOBD**: A brain MRI dataset that includes 662 3D anatomical images, used for detecting bipolar disorder.

6. **BHB**: This dataset consists of 10,420 3D brain MRI images of healthy subjects, used as a pre-training dataset.

7. **RandBits-CIFAR10**: A modified version of the CIFAR-10 dataset, where random bits are added to each image to create additional channels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
