To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Adversarial Robustness via Feature Pattern Consistency Constraint" by Jiacong Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to evaluate the proposed methods. The authors may mention specific datasets or benchmarks that are critical to their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using two widely utilized datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their purpose and any relevant statistics mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is the same as CIFAR-10, as both datasets were introduced in the same work:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
