To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive Text-to-texture Synthesis via Unified Depth-aware Inpainting" by Jiaxiang Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in 3D content generation and mention the use of a unified depth-aware inpainting model trained on 3D datasets. This suggests that specific datasets are involved, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the training process. They mention training their model on the **Objaverse dataset** and using rendered images from **Cap3D**. This is a crucial point as it indicates the datasets used for training their model.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their implementation and mention filtering the Objaverse dataset to retain high-quality textures. This reinforces the importance of the Objaverse dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Objaverse dataset**, the citation is:
   > Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., Farhadi, A. "Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 13142–13153, 2023.

2. For the **Cap3D dataset**, the citation is:
   > Gao, J., Shen, T., Wang, Z., Chen, W., Yin, K., Li, D., Litany, O., Gojcic, Z., Fidler, S. "Get3D: A generative model of high quality 3D textured shapes learned from images." NeurIPS 35, 31841–31854, 2022.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **Objaverse**: A large dataset containing a universe of annotated 3D objects, used for training the texture synthesis model.
- **Cap3D**: A dataset providing rendered images of 3D objects, utilized in conjunction with Objaverse for training.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
