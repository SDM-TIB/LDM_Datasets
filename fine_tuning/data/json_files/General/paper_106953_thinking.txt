To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Positional Encoding Augmented GAN for the Assessment of Wind Flow for Pedestrian Comfort in Urban Areas" by Henrik HÃ¸iness et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were generated.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Wall Dataset (D1)**: Contains 417 geometries of walls with respective CFD simulations. The geometries have different center offsets and angles relative to the wind inlet direction.

2. **Single Building Dataset (D2)**: Comprises 548 geometries of single buildings with a fixed height, varying in length and width.

3. **Two Buildings Dataset (D3)**: Includes 658 geometries of two buildings with varying center offsets and dimensions.

4. **Two Buildings with Varying Height Dataset (D4)**: Contains 474 geometries similar to D3 but includes height as an additional channel.

5. **Real Urban City Environment Dataset (D5)**: Comprises 287 geometries from the city center of Oslo, Norway, with complex shapes and multiple height values.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. If the datasets are original to the authors, I will note that they are not cited from external sources. However, if they reference existing datasets, I will extract the full citation for each.

For example, if the Wall Dataset is based on a specific methodology or previous work, I will find the corresponding citation in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information presented.
