To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep learning model trained on mobile phone-acquired frozen section images effectively detects basal cell carcinoma" by Junli Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves **1,241 images of frozen sections** acquired using mobile phones, which suggests that this collection of images is a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They specify that the dataset consists of **1,241 images**, with **598 images containing basal cell carcinoma** and **643 images negative for basal cell carcinoma**. The images were taken at **100x magnification** and were randomly partitioned into a training set of **1,116 images** and a test set of **125 images**. This information confirms that the dataset is well-defined and structured.

I will also look for any specific naming of the dataset. In this case, the authors refer to their dataset simply as the **mobile phone-acquired frozen section images dataset**. Since there are no other datasets mentioned in the paper, this will be the only dataset I need to describe.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it is an original collection created by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is unique to this study and does not have an external citation.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details about its composition and usage in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information and provided a clear description of the dataset used in this research.
