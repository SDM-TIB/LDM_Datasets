To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Deep Convolutional Neural Fields for Depth Estimation from a Single Image" by Fayao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used in their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **NYU v2 Kinect Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1449 RGBD images of indoor scenes, with a standard training/test split of 795 for training and 654 for testing.

2. **Make3D Dataset**: This dataset contains 534 images depicting outdoor scenes, and the authors discuss specific evaluation criteria for this dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I find are:

- For the **NYU v2 Kinect Dataset**:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

- For the **Make3D Dataset**:
  > A. Saxena, M. Sun, and A. Y. Ng. *Make3D: Learning 3D scene structure from a single still image*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
