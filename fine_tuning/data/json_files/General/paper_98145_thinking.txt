To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Positional Encodings for Vision Transformers" by Xiangxiang Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **ImageNet classification task**, which suggests that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4.1) where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention using the **ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of image classification. The authors specify that this dataset contains **1,000 classes and 1.3 million images**, and they report results on the validation set with **50,000 images**.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used is the **ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset**.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the datasets utilized in the research.
