To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inducing Causal Structure for Interpretable Neural Networks" by Atticus Geiger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three tasks: MNIST-PVR, ReaSCAN, and MQNLI. This suggests that these tasks are associated with specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluations in detail. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST-PVR**: This dataset is constructed using the MNIST dataset and is used for a visual reasoning task. The authors reference Zhang et al. (2021) for the dataset's details.

2. **ReaSCAN**: This dataset is a synthetic command-based navigation task that builds off the SCAN and gSCAN benchmarks. The authors cite Wu et al. (2021) for the dataset.

3. **MQNLI**: This dataset is a synthetic natural language inference dataset where the task is to label the semantic relation between two sentences. The authors reference Geiger et al. (2019) for this dataset.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST-PVR**, the citation is:

- For **ReaSCAN**, the citation is:

- For **MQNLI**, the citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
