To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human Pose as Compositional Tokens" by Zigang Geng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of human pose estimation and mention that they evaluate their approach on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 150K labeled human instances for training, 5K images for validation, and 30K images for testing.
2. **MPII Dataset**: Contains 40K labeled human instances performing various activities.
3. **CrowdPose Dataset**: A dataset specifically designed for crowded scenes, where occluded joints are manually labeled.
4. **OCHuman Dataset**: Another dataset focused on occluded joints, with validation and test sets provided.
5. **SyncOCC Dataset**: A synthetic dataset generated by UnrealCV, which provides accurate locations of occluded joints.
6. **Human3.6M Dataset**: A dataset for 3D pose estimation, containing 11 human subjects performing daily actions.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- **COCO Dataset**:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755, 2014.

- **MPII Dataset**:

- **SyncOCC Dataset**:
  > Zhe Zhang, Chunyu Wang, Weichao Qiu, Wenhu Qin, and Wenjun Zeng. *Adafuse: Adaptive multiview fusion for accurate human pose estimation in the wild*. IJCV, pages 1–16, 2020.

- **Human3.6M Dataset**:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 36(7):1325–1339, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
