To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixtures of Gaussian process experts based on kernel stick-breaking processes" by Yuji Saikai and Khue-Dung Dang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the model's performance is demonstrated using **six datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, as it is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention that they conducted experiments using **five different datasets generated by five test functions found in the computer simulation literature**. This is a clear indication that I need to extract the names and details of these datasets.

I will carefully read through the subsections of Section 4, particularly **4.2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors list the datasets along with their descriptions. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Borehole function**: A mathematical function used for testing purposes, defined with specific variable ranges.
2. **Dette & Pepelyshev exponential function**: Another mathematical function, also defined with variable ranges.
3. **Dette & Pepelyshev 8-D function**: A more complex function defined in eight dimensions.
4. **Franke function**: A well-known test function in the literature, defined over a specific range.
5. **Gramacy & Lee function**: A function that includes random noise, defined in six dimensions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Borehole function**:
  > Brian A Worley. *Deterministic uncertainty analysis*. Oak Ridge National Lab., TN (USA), 1987.

- For the **Dette & Pepelyshev exponential function**:
  > Holger Dette and Andrey Pepelyshev. *Generalized Latin hypercube design for computer experiments*. Technometrics, 52(4):421–429, 2010.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
