To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "SigScatNet: A Siamese + Scattering based Deep Learning Approach for Signature Forgery Detection and Similarity Assessment" by Anmol Chokshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two open-sourced datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (Section III.B), where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ICDAR 2011 SigComp Dutch Signature Dataset**: This dataset is divided into "train" and "test" folders. The training set includes samples from 64 individuals, each with at least 24 genuine and 8 forged signatures. The test set contains samples from 42 individuals, each with a minimum of 12 authentic and 12 forged signatures.

2. **CEDAR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1320 forgeries and 1320 genuine signatures, with 24 signatures from each of 55 writers. The authors specify that 40 individuals are used for training and 15 for testing.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the ICDAR SigComp Dutch dataset is available in the ICDAR 2011 Signature Verification Competition repository, and the CEDAR dataset is available from the University of Buffalo repository. However, I need to ensure that I provide proper citations for these datasets.

For the **ICDAR 2011 SigComp Dutch Signature Dataset**, the citation is:
> ICDAR 2011 Signature Verification Competition. Available at: http://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=2

For the **CEDAR Dataset**, the citation is:
> CEDAR Dataset. Available at: http://www.cedar.buffalo.edu/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, including their purpose and the context in which they were used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining the importance of including full citations for each dataset.
