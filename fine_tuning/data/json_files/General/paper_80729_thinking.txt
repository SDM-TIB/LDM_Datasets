To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle filter-based Gaussian process optimisation for parameter inference" by Johan Dahlin and Fredrik Lindsten, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where the authors might describe the experiments and the data used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets" or "Experiments" section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their method's performance on two state space models, but I need to confirm if they provide specific datasets or simulations used for testing.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention a **linear Gaussian state space (LGSS) model** and a **nonlinear stochastic volatility model** as examples. However, they do not provide specific datasets from external sources but rather describe the models and their parameters used in simulations.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will note that the datasets used are simulated data based on the described models rather than external datasets. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Linear Gaussian State Space Model**: This model is simulated for T = 250 time steps with a known parameter θ* = 0.5. The dataset consists of simulated observations generated from this model.

2. **Nonlinear Stochastic Volatility Model**: This model is also simulated with parameters θ* = {0.90, 0.20} over T = 250 time steps. Similar to the previous model, the dataset consists of simulated observations.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the references, I will not provide citations for datasets as they are not applicable in this case. Instead, I will summarize the information about the simulated datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the datasets, even though they are not traditional datasets from external sources. This will ensure clarity in understanding the data used for the experiments in the paper.
