To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exact high-dimensional asymptotics for Support Vector Machine" by Haoyang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the study or related works.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss empirical results or simulations, as these sections often detail the datasets used for validation or testing. 

In the **Empirical results** section, I will pay close attention to any mention of data generation methods or specific datasets. For instance, the paper discusses generating data under different models (e.g., global null case, signaled case) and may provide details on how the data was simulated or sourced.

If the paper does not explicitly name datasets, I will look for references to other works or datasets in the **References section** that may have been used for comparison or validation. This is crucial as it may lead to identifying the datasets indirectly referenced in the paper.

Once I identify any datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. This includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year, as this information is essential for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its citation in the references and document it accordingly.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining the integrity of the citations.
