To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Chemical Space Exploration Using Active Learning Based on Marginalized Graph Kernel: an Application for Predicting the Thermodynamic Properties of Alkanes with Molecular Simulation" by Yan Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves **251,728 alkane molecules** and their thermodynamic properties, which suggests that this is a significant dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE)**, which is a source of experimental data, and they also mention the **Industrial Fluid Properties Simulation Challenges (IFPSC)**, indicating that these datasets may be relevant.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the **active learning molecular simulation (ALMS) workflow** and mention that they targeted **alkane molecules with 4 to 19 carbon atoms**, totaling **251,728 distinct molecules**. This is a clear indication of the dataset they constructed for their study.

The **results section** discusses the performance of their model using subsets of the original dataset, specifically mentioning subsets with different uncertainty thresholds (e.g., **313, 599, and 1679 molecules**). This indicates that they utilized these subsets for training and validation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **NIST ThermoData Engine (TDE)**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
