To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable AI for Enhancing Efficiency of DL-based Channel Estimation" by Abdul Karim Gizzini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research. If such a section is present, I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will search through the **methodology** and **results** sections for any references to datasets. Authors often describe the datasets in the context of their experimental setup or when discussing their results.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to ensure that I provide complete and accurate citations, as these are essential for proper attribution and further research.

For example, if I find that the paper uses a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset online or in other literature to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset names, descriptions, and their full citations in a structured manner, ensuring clarity and completeness.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and provide the required citations for each dataset used in the research.
