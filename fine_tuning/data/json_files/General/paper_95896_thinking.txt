To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TJU-DHD: A Diverse High-Resolution Dataset for Object Detection" by Yanwei Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the creation of a new dataset called **TJU-DHD**, which is a diverse high-resolution dataset for object detection. This is a strong indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and emphasize the need for a new dataset tailored for specific application scenarios. They mention that the TJU-DHD dataset contains 115,354 high-resolution images and 709,330 labeled objects, which provides a good starting point for my extraction.

In the **dataset details section (III)**, the authors provide comprehensive information about the TJU-DHD dataset, including its two subsets: **TJU-DHD-trafic** and **TJU-DHD-campus**. I will note the following details:

1. **TJU-DHD-trafic**: 
   - Contains 60,266 images and 331,622 labeled instances.
   - Images have a fixed resolution of 1,624×1,200 pixels.
   - Includes five object classes: car, van, truck, pedestrian, and rider.

2. **TJU-DHD-campus**: 
   - Contains 55,088 images and 377,708 labeled instances.
   - Images have a resolution of at least 2,560×1,440 pixels.
   - Focuses on two classes: pedestrian and rider.

The paper also mentions a new large-scale pedestrian dataset called **TJU-DHD-pedestrian**, which is derived from the two subsets above. This dataset includes:
- **TJU-Ped-trafic**: 20,338 images and 43,618 labeled pedestrians.
- **TJU-Ped-campus**: 55,088 images and 329,623 labeled pedestrians.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference several existing datasets, but the primary focus is on their newly created datasets. Since the TJU-DHD dataset is original to this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For **TJU-DHD**:
  > Yanwei Pang, Jiale Cao, Yazhao Li, Jin Xie, Hanqing Sun, Jinfeng Gong. *TJU-DHD: A Diverse High-Resolution Dataset for Object Detection*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2023.

- For **TJU-DHD-trafic** and **TJU-DHD-campus**, I will use the same citation as they are part of the TJU-DHD dataset.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets presented in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
