To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Models are Unsupervised Predictors of Page Quality: A Colossal-Scale Study" by Dara Bahri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a study over **500 million web articles**, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In **subsection 3.1 (Datasets)**, they explicitly list three datasets:

1. **Web500M**: This dataset consists of a random sample of 500 million English web documents obtained from the Common Crawl. This is a significant dataset for their analysis.

2. **GPT-2-Output**: This public dataset includes the WebText test split and its GPT-2 generations under eight different settings. It is divided into train, test, and validation splits with specific example counts (250k, 5k, and 5k respectively).

3. **Grover-Output**: This dataset was generated using the pre-trained Grover-Base model, consisting of 1.2 million articles with various sampling hyperparameters. The authors used the public Grover source code for generating this data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Web500M**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. *Common Crawl*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/.

- For **GPT-2-Output**, the citation is:
  > OpenAI. *GPT-2 Output Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset.

- For **Grover-Output**, the citation is:
  > Rowanz. *Grover: A State-of-the-Art Model for Text Generation*. Available at: https://github.com/rowanz/grover.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
