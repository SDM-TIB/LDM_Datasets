To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADVISE: ADaptive Feature Relevance and VISual Explanations for Convolutional Neural Networks" by Mohammad Mahdi Dehshibi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various pretrained models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **ILSVRC (ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge)** for their experiments. This is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC dataset. The citation for the ILSVRC dataset is:

- **ILSVRC**: 
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. In Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for ILSVRC, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset extracted from this paper.
