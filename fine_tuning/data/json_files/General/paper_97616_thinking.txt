To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwingBot: Learning Physical Features from In-hand Tactile Exploration for Dynamic Swing-up Manipulation" by Chen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this paper, the authors mention the creation of a dataset that contains 33 different objects, which is crucial information. I will look for specific details about how this dataset was constructed, including the types of objects, the variations in physical properties, and the number of trials conducted.

In the **dataset description** section, the authors provide detailed information about the objects used in their experiments. They mention that the dataset includes objects with different surface frictions, masses, and configurations affecting the center of mass and moment of inertia. This section is vital for understanding the dataset's composition and its relevance to the research.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors provide any additional insights or results related to the datasets. This may include performance metrics or comparisons that highlight the importance of the datasets in validating their approach.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the following details for each dataset:
1. **Dataset Name**: A clear and concise name for the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the types of objects and their physical properties.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset or related work, formatted correctly.

For example, the dataset mentioned in the paper could be described as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: SwingBot Object Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 33 different objects used for dynamic swing-up manipulation experiments, featuring variations in surface friction, mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia.
- **Full Citation**: Chen Wang, Shaoxiong Wang, Branden Romero, Filipe Veiga, and Edward Adelson. "SwingBot: Learning Physical Features from In-hand Tactile Exploration for Dynamic Swing-up Manipulation." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2023.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is structured appropriately for further processing or review.
