To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GasHis-Transformer: A Multi-scale Visual Transformer Approach for Gastric Histopathological Image Detection" by Haoyuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that a publicly available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained gastric histopathological image dataset is used, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They refer to it as the **HE-GHI-DS**, which is described as an open-source dataset containing 140 normal images and 560 abnormal images of gastric histopathological images in ‘*.tiff’ format, with specific details about the image size and staining process.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the HE-GHI-DS dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> Sun, C., Li, C., & Li, Y. (2022). Data for hcrf. Mendeley Data. https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/thgf23xgy7/2

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **HE-GHI-DS**: This dataset is used for gastric histopathological image detection, containing 140 normal and 560 abnormal images, with images in ‘*.tiff’ format and a size of 2048×2048 pixels.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis in future work.
