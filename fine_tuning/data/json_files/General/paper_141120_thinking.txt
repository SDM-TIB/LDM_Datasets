To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster-Based Normalization Layer for Neural Networks" by Bilal Faye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention several benchmark datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 32 × 32 pixels, distributed across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Derived from the Tiny Images dataset, it consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images of size 32 × 32, divided into 100 classes grouped into 20 superclasses.
3. **Tiny ImageNet**: A reduced version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images and 50 test images per class.
4. **MNIST digits**: Contains 70,000 grayscale images of size 28 × 28 representing the 10 digits, with around 6,000 training images and 1,000 testing images per class.
5. **SVHN**: A challenging dataset with over 600,000 digit images, focusing on recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*, 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*, 2009.

- **Tiny ImageNet**:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*, CS 231N, 2015.

- **MNIST digits**:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*, 2010.

- **SVHN**:
  > P. Sermanet, S. Chintala, and Y. LeCun. *Convolutional Neural Networks Applied to House Numbers Digit Classification*, in Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR2012), pp. 3288–3291, IEEE, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
