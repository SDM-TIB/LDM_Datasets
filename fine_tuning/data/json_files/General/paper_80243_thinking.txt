To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Learning for Interaction Activity Recognition in RGBD Videos" by Ngu Nguyen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were conducted using data collected by RGBD cameras, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental results** section. In this case, I find that the paper discusses experiments conducted on the **OA2 dataset**, which is a subset of the dataset referenced in the paper by Wang et al. (2014). The introduction of the OA2 dataset is found in the **experimental results section**, where it describes the activities included in the dataset and the context of the experiments.

I will then gather specific details about the OA2 dataset, including the number of activities it contains and the context in which it was used. The paper mentions that the OA2 dataset includes ten interaction activities performed by subjects in office settings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OA2 dataset. The paper cites Wang et al. (2014) as the source of the dataset. I will extract the full citation for this reference:

- For the **OA2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, K., Wang, X., Lin, L., Wang, M., and Zuo, W. *3D human activity recognition with reconfigurable convolutional neural networks*. In ACM Multimedia, 2014. ISBN 978-1-4503-3063-3. doi: 10.1145/2647868.2654912. URL http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2647868.2654912.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details and its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for presentation or further processing.
