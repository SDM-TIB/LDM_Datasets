To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Corticosteroid Activation of Atlantic Sea Lamprey Corticoid Receptor: Allosteric Regulation by the N-terminal Domain" by Yoshinao Katsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets or specific data analyses.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, which often contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted and the data collected. In this section, the authors discuss the expression levels of lamprey CR1 and CR2, as well as their responses to various corticosteroids. They mention using RNA-Seq analysis to investigate the expression of these receptors in different tissues, which indicates that there is a dataset related to gene expression.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the RNA-Seq analysis in detail, including the accession number for the dataset from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This is crucial as it provides a direct reference to the dataset used in the study.

I will note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **RNA-Seq Dataset for Lamprey CR Expression**: This dataset includes single-end RNA-Seq reads of sea lamprey for various developmental stages and tissues. The authors specify that the data can be accessed through NCBI with the accession number PRJNA50489.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the RNA-Seq dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Smith JJ, Timoshevskaya N, Ye C, Holt C, Keinath MC, Parker HJ, Cook ME, Hess JE, Narum SR, Lamanna F, Kaessmann H, Timoshevskiy VA, Waterbury CKM, Saraceno C, Wiedemann LM, Robb SMC, Baker C, Eichler EE, Hockman D, Sauka-Spengler T, Yandell M, Krumlauf R, Elgar G, Amemiya CT. *The sea lamprey germline genome provides insights into programmed genome rearrangement and vertebrate evolution*. Nat Genet. 2018 Feb;50(2):270-277. doi: 10.1038/s41588-017-0036-1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the RNA-Seq dataset as it is essential for proper referencing in any downstream applications or analyses.
