To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a tracking algorithm based on the clustering of spatio-temporal clouds of points" by Andrea Cavagna et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the challenges of 3D tracking in biological systems, which suggests that experimental datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the use of experimental data on collective animal behavior. They reference previous works that likely include datasets used for tracking animal movements, such as studies on bird flocks, bats, and insect swarms. I will look for specific dataset names or references.

In the **testing section**, the authors describe tests performed on a semi-natural dataset of midge swarms. They mention that this dataset was tracked using a method from a previous study, which indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** for any datasets that are cited. The authors reference several studies that may contain datasets relevant to their work. For instance, they mention the work by Attanasi et al. (2014) regarding collective behavior in midge swarms, which likely includes the dataset they used.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Midge Swarm Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the Prometheus algorithm. It consists of experimental data on midge swarms tracked for 200 frames. The authors reference the work of Attanasi et al. (2014) for this dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Attanasi, A., Cavagna, A., Del Castello, L., Giardina, I., Melillo, S., Parisi, L., Pohl, O., Rossaro, B., Shen, E., Silvestri, E., et al. (2014). Collective behaviour without collective order in wild swarms of midges. *PLoS Computational Biology*, 10(7): e1003697.

Next, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that the full citations for each dataset are included for proper attribution.
