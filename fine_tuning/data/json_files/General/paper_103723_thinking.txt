To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Dataset For Large-scale 3D Facial Emotion Recognition" by Faizan Farooq Khan and Dr. Zulqarnain Gilani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract highlights the generation of a large dataset of 3D faces with labeled emotions, which indicates that a dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for 3D facial emotion recognition (FER). They mention that existing datasets are significantly smaller than the one they propose, which suggests that they will provide details about their dataset later in the paper.

In the **data generation process section**, the authors provide specific details about their dataset. They mention that they generated a dataset containing **832,000 3D facial scans of 100 unique identities**, each with **6 basic expressions and a neutral face**. This is a crucial piece of information as it describes the size and composition of their dataset.

Additionally, they reference the **BU3DFE dataset** as a source for training and testing their network, which is another dataset that needs to be documented. They state that they used 3D facial scans from the BU3DFE dataset to train their model, which indicates its relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **BU3DFE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yin, Lijun, Wei, Xiaozhou, Sun, Yi, Wang, Jun, and Rosato, Matthew J. "A 3D Facial Expression Database For Facial Behavior Research." In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition, 2006, pp. 211-216.

2. For the **Bosphorus dataset**, which is mentioned in the context of comparison, the citation is:
   > Savran, A., et al. "Bosphorus Database for 3D Face Analysis." In Biometrics and Identity Management, edited by Schouten, B., Juul, N.C., Drygajlo, A., and Tistarelli, M., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 5372, Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2008, pp. 6-12. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-89991-4_6

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Generated 3D Facial Emotion Dataset**: Contains 832,000 3D facial scans of 100 unique identities, each with 6 basic expressions and a neutral face.
2. **BU3DFE Dataset**: A dataset used for training and testing, consisting of 3D facial scans.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the necessary details and citations for each dataset, ensuring that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
