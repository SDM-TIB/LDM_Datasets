To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Scale Clustering with Variational EM for Gaussian Mixture Models" by Florian Hirschberger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to the **80 Million Tiny Images dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets, which includes:

1. **KDD Dataset**: This dataset is described as a protein homology dataset used in the KDD Cup 2004, with 145,751 samples and 74 features.
2. **RNA Dataset**: This dataset consists of RNA input sequence pairs, containing 488,565 samples and 8 features.
3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This well-known dataset has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with each image being 32x32 pixels in size and having 3 color channels.
4. **SUSY Dataset**: This dataset is related to high-energy physics, containing 5,000,000 samples and 18 features.
5. **SONG Dataset**: Compiled from the Million Song Dataset, it has 515,345 samples and 90 features.
6. **80 Million Tiny Images Dataset**: This dataset contains 78,302,017 training images and 1,000,000 test images, each with 3,072 features.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
