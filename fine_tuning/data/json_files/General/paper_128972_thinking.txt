To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Graph Information in Transformer-based AMR Parsing" by Pavlo Vasylenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on AMR 2.0 and AMR 3.0 datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will examine **section 6 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two benchmark datasets:

1. **AMR 2.0**: This dataset consists of 36,521 training pairs, 1,368 validation pairs, and 1,371 test pairs. It is a well-known dataset for AMR parsing.

2. **AMR 3.0**: This dataset contains 55,635 training pairs, 1,722 validation pairs, and 1,898 test pairs. Similar to AMR 2.0, it is widely used in the field of AMR parsing.

Additionally, the authors mention testing on two out-of-distribution datasets: **The Little Prince (TLP)** and **Bio AMR**, but they do not provide detailed descriptions or citations for these datasets in the main text.

To ensure I have the correct citations for the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the AMR datasets are as follows:

- For **AMR 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Knight, Bianca Badarau, Laura Baranescu, Claire Bonial, Madalina Bardocz, Kira Griffitt, Ulf Hermjakob, Daniel Marcu, Martha Palmer, Tim O’Gorman, and Nathan Schneider. *Abstract meaning representation (AMR) annotation release 3.0*. 2020.

- For **AMR 3.0**, the citation is:
  > Kevin Knight, Bianca Badarau, Laura Baranescu, Claire Bonial, Madalina Bardocz, Kira Griffitt, Ulf Hermjakob, Daniel Marcu, Martha Palmer, Tim O’Gorman, and Nathan Schneider. *Abstract meaning representation (AMR) annotation release 3.0*. 2020.

Since both AMR 2.0 and AMR 3.0 are cited from the same source, I will ensure to note that they are distinct datasets despite sharing the citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
