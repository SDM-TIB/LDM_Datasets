To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inherent Noise in Gradient Based Methods" by Arushi Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses various works related to neural networks and their generalization capabilities, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. If the paper includes a section dedicated to experiments, it may provide details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the paper refers to established datasets, I will need to locate the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to ensure accurate citation.

After reviewing the entire paper, I will summarize the findings regarding datasets. If I find any datasets, I will ensure to include the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
