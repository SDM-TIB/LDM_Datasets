To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Guided Optimization on Large Language Model Search Trees" by Julia Grosse et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors might have used to validate their method. The introduction discusses the optimization of large language models but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset is used for text generation tasks. The authors filtered for text samples with at least 500 tokens, resulting in a test set with 332 sequences.

2. **CNN Daily Mail Dataset**: This dataset is also utilized for text generation, with a context length of 300 tokens and generating 60 tokens.

3. **TL;DR Dataset**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks, where the authors generated 40-token long summaries from 1000 random samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Wikipedia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org).

- For the **CNN Daily Mail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In NIPS, 2015.

- For the **TL;DR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Michael VÃ¶lske, Martin Potthast, Shahbaz Syed, and Benno Stein. *TL;DR: Mining Reddit to learn automatic summarization*. In Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, 2017.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
