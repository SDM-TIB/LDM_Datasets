To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subspace Identification for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation" by Zijian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their model on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four benchmark datasets: **Office-Home**, **PACS**, **ImageCLEF**, and **DomainNet**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

1. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4 domains (Art, Clipart, Product, RealWorld) with 65 categories. It is used for evaluating domain adaptation methods.

2. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset includes images from 4 domains (Photo, Artpainting, Cartoon, Sketch) and contains a total of 9991 images across 7 categories. It is also used for domain adaptation tasks.

3. **ImageCLEF Dataset**: This dataset is a standard benchmark for image classification, consisting of three domains (Caltech-256, ImageNet ILSVRC, Pascal VOC2012) with 12 classes.

4. **DomainNet Dataset**: This dataset is more challenging, containing 0.6 million images across 345 categories and 6 different styles (Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, Sketch).

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

For example, the citation for the **Office-Home dataset** might look like:
> A. A. Author, B. B. Author, and C. C. Author. *Office-Home: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Domain Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure I have the correct citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This systematic approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
