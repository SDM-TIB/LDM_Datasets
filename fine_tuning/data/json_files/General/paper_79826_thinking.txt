To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BinaryConnect: Training Deep Neural Networks with Binary Weights During Propagations" by Matthieu Courbariaux et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved near state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Benchmark results)**, where the authors discuss their results on three datasets: 

1. **Permutation-invariant MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (28x28 grayscale). The authors mention that the model must be unaware of the 2-D structure of the data.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset includes 50,000 training and 10,000 test color images (32x32) representing 10 different classes (airplanes, automobiles, birds, etc.). The authors describe their preprocessing steps and the architecture used for training.

3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset contains 604,000 training and 26,000 test color images (32x32) of digits. The authors note that they follow a similar procedure as CIFAR-10 but with some adjustments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, November 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
