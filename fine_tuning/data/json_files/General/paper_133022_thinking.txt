To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KEEP MOVING: IDENTIFYING TASK-RELEVANT SUBSPACES TO MAXIMISE PLASTICITY FOR NEWLY LEARNED TASKS" by Daniel Anthes et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of a "CIFAR-110 continual learning benchmark" and "CIFAR-10" as part of their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "3.1 NETWORK, TASK, AND TRAINING." Here, the authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they constructed 11 datasets for the CIFAR-110 task, with the first task being the full CIFAR-10 dataset. They also mention that subsequent tasks involve sampling from the CIFAR-100 dataset.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details about the datasets used. The appendix provides further insights into how the datasets were constructed and the specific configurations used during training.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **CIFAR-110 Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, so it does not have a separate citation. Instead, it is referenced as a combination of the two.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
