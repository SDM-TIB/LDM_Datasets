To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High Resolution Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation of Synthetically Rendered Face Images" by Stephan J. Garbin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of generating photorealistic images and hints at the use of a dataset for training the StyleGAN2 model. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **FFHQ dataset** (Flickr-Faces-HQ) for training their StyleGAN2 model. This is a crucial dataset for understanding the context of their work.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The authors describe their approach in detail, but they primarily focus on the FFHQ dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the FFHQ dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For **FFHQ dataset**:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. CoRR abs/1812.04948.

Since the FFHQ dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
