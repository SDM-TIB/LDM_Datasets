To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is GPT-4 a Good Data Analyst?" by Liying Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using a dataset called **NvBench** (Luo et al., 2021) to evaluate GPT-4's performance as a data analyst. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **Related Work** section, specifically subsection 2.1, where the authors discuss relevant tasks and datasets. Here, they mention the **NvBench dataset** in detail, describing it as a dataset that translates natural language queries to corresponding visualizations. This section provides additional context about the dataset's purpose and structure.

In the **Experiments** section, the authors confirm that they used the **NvBench dataset** for their experiments, specifying that they randomly selected 1,000 questions from various domains. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In the **Related Work** section, the authors reference other datasets related to tasks such as text-to-SQL and chart summarization, including **Spider**, **SParC**, and **CoSQL**. However, these datasets are not used in their experiments, so I will focus on the **NvBench dataset** for extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **NvBench dataset** from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> Liying Cheng, Dekun Wu, Lidong Bing, Yan Zhang, Zhanming Jie, Wei Lu, and Luo Si. *Synthesizing natural language to visualization (nl2vis) benchmarks from nl2sql benchmarks*. In Proceedings of SIGMOD, 2021.

Since the paper does not provide additional datasets that are used in the experiments, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **NvBench dataset**, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output.
