To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ComBiNet: Compact Convolutional Bayesian Neural Network for Image Segmentation" by Martin Ferianc et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on "diverse challenging datasets with few observations," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors discuss their evaluation on specific datasets. In **Section 4.1**, they describe the **CamVid dataset** in detail, stating that it consists of 367 frames for training, 101 frames for validation, and 233 frames for testing, with 11 manually labeled classes. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors mention the **bacteria dataset**, which comprises 366 darkfield microscopy images with manually annotated masks for segmentation. This dataset is also essential for their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
   > Brostow, G.J., Shotton, J., Fauqueur, J., Cipolla, R. (2008). *Segmentation and recognition using structure from motion point clouds*. In: ECCV. pp. 44â€“57. Springer.

2. For the **bacteria dataset**, the citation is:
   > Nguyen, L. (2020). *Bacteria detection with darkfield microscopy*. Data retrieved from work at Hochschule Heilbronn, www.kaggle.com/longnguyen2306/bacteria-detection-with-darkfield-microscopy/metadata.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
