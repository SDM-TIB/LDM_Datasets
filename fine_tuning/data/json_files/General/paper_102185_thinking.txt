To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning based Food Instance Segmentation using Synthetic Data" by Deokhwan Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated synthetic data using Blender and built a real-world dataset for food segmentation, which suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset." Here, the authors describe two datasets in detail:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors generated a synthetic dataset using Blender, consisting of 28,839 images, including RGB and mask images for unseen food segmentation. This dataset is crucial for training their deep learning model.

2. **Real-world Dataset**: The authors built a real-world food dataset consisting of images of 50 kinds of Korean food, collected through a food image acquisition system. They annotated 229 images for this dataset, which is used to verify the performance of their model.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **UNIMIB2016 dataset** as a public dataset for performance comparison. This dataset contains 1,010 tray images with multiple foods and is relevant for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **UNIMIB2016 dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Ciocca, P. Napoletano, and R. Schettini. "Food recognition: a new dataset, experiments, and results." *IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, vol. 21, no. 3, pp. 588â€“598, 2016.

The synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation since it was generated by the authors using Blender, but I will note that it is based on their own methodology.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
