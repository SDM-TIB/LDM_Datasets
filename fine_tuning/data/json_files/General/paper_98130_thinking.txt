To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Softmax Policy Gradient Methods Can Take Exponential Time to Converge" by Gen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

2. **Identifying Sections**: I will look for specific sections that typically contain information about datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research.

3. **Extracting Dataset Information**: As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data, etc.). If the paper refers to existing datasets, I will ensure to note their original sources.

4. **Checking References**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Documenting Datasets**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
   - **Citation**: The full citation of the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Final Review**: I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness. This includes verifying that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and that citations are correctly formatted.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference.
