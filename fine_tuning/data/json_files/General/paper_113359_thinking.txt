To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AsNER - Annotated Dataset and Baseline for Assamese Named Entity Recognition" by Dhrubajyoti Pathak et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the AsNER dataset, which is a named entity annotation dataset for the Assamese language, indicating that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the AsNER dataset. They mention that the dataset contains approximately 99,000 tokens, derived from various sources, including the speeches of the Prime Minister of India and Assamese plays. This section confirms that the AsNER dataset is the main focus of the paper.

In this section, the authors also provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of sentences and tokens, and the distribution of entity classes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AsNER dataset. However, since the dataset is introduced in this paper and does not reference another source, I will use the paper itself as the citation.

The citation for the AsNER dataset is:
> Dhrubajyoti Pathak, Sukumar Nandi, and Priyankoo Sarmah. *AsNER - Annotated Dataset and Baseline for Assamese Named Entity Recognition*. Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, North Guwahati, India.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Review section 3 for detailed information about the AsNER dataset.
3. Locate the citation for the dataset in the references.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the AsNER dataset.
