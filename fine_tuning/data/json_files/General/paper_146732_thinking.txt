To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SALSA: Swift Adaptive Lightweight Self-Attention for Enhanced LiDAR Place Recognition" by Raktim Gautam Goswami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods on various LiDAR place recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they tested their framework on. The paper mentions six large-scale LiDAR localization benchmarks:

1. **Daejeon Convention Center (DCC)**: A dataset used for evaluating place recognition in urban environments.
2. **Sejong**: Another dataset from the Mulran collection, used for similar evaluations.
3. **Apollo-Southbay**: A dataset that provides a diverse set of LiDAR scans for testing.
4. **KITTI**: A well-known dataset in the field of robotics and autonomous driving, containing various scenes and conditions.
5. **ALITA**: A large-scale incremental dataset designed for long-term autonomy.
6. **KITTI360**: An extension of the KITTI dataset that includes additional scenes for comprehensive evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference.
