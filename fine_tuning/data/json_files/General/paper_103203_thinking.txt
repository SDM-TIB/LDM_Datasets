To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Digging into Uncertainty in Self-supervised Multi-view Stereo" by Hongbin Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **DTU** and **Tanks&Temples** benchmarks, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. In the paper, the authors explicitly state that:

1. **DTU Dataset**: This is described as a large-scale indoor MVS dataset collected by robotic arms, consisting of 124 scenes with high-resolution images captured from 49 different views under 7 controlled lighting conditions.

2. **Tanks&Temples Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as an outdoor MVS dataset that contains challenging realistic scenes. The authors mention that they follow the official split of MVSNet for training and testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **DTU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Henrik Aanæs, Rasmus Ramsbøl Jensen, George Vogiatzis, Engin Tola, and Anders Bjorholm Dahl. *Large-scale data for multiple-view stereopsis*. International Journal of Computer Vision, pages 1–16, 2016.

- For the **Tanks&Temples Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arno Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 36(4), 2017.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
