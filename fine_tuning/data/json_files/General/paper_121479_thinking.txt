To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Meta-Pooling Learning for Lightweight Image Classification Model" by Peijie Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the results are demonstrated on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In Section 3.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on the **ImageNet dataset**.

Now, I will gather more information about the **ImageNet dataset** from the **References section** to ensure I have the full citation. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:

- **ImageNet Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 25, pp. 1106â€“1114, 2012.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the ImageNet dataset for its experiments, I will note that this is the only dataset mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
