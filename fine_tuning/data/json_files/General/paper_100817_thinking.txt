To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Entropy Regularization Free Mechanism for Policy-based Reinforcement Learning" by Changnan Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**, which suggests that datasets related to this environment may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify any datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and results. They mention using **57 Atari games** as part of their evaluation, which indicates that the datasets are likely derived from these games.

I will also check the **references section** to find any specific citations related to the datasets used. The authors may refer to the original sources of the datasets or benchmarks they utilized.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)**: This is a widely used benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning algorithms. It consists of a collection of Atari 2600 games that serve as environments for training and testing RL agents.

2. **Atari 57 Games**: The paper specifically mentions evaluating their method on 57 different Atari games, which are part of the ALE. Each game serves as a unique dataset for testing the performance of the proposed mechanism.

Now, I will look for full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Arcade Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 47, 253-279.

- For the **Atari 57 Games**, the citation is typically the same as the ALE, as they are part of the same framework. However, if specific papers for individual games are referenced, I will include those as well.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
