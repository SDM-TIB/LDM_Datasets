To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dynamic Sampling Adaptive-SGD Method for Machine Learning" by Achraf Bahamou and Donald Goldfarb, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments but does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the optimization method but does not name any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 7) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that for binary classification using logistic regression, they chose **6 datasets from LIBSVM** (Chang & Lin, 2011). They also provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics.

The datasets mentioned are:
1. **Covertype**: 581,012 data points, 54 dimensions.
2. **Webspam**: 350,000 data points, 254 dimensions.
3. **rcv1-train.binary**: 47,237 data points, 20,242 dimensions.
4. **real-sim**: 20,959 data points, 72,309 dimensions.
5. **a1a**: 30,956 data points, 123 dimensions.
6. **ionosphere**: 351 data points, 34 dimensions.

In addition to the binary classification datasets, the authors also mention using the **MNIST Dataset** (LeCun, 1998) for their DNN experiments, which consists of handwritten digits. They also reference the **CIFAR10 Dataset** (Krizhevsky, 2009) for experiments with various neural network architectures.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **LIBSVM Datasets**:
   - Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(3), 27:1â€“27:27. Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm.

2. **MNIST Dataset**:
   - LeCun, Y. (1998). *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. Available at: https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/10027939599/en/.

3. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   - Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries for the identified datasets, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation.
