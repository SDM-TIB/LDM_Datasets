To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Jigsaw Learning for Cartoon Face Recognition" by Yong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on "two popular cartoon face datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look closely at the **related work** section, where the authors discuss existing datasets. They mention two specific datasets: **iCartoonFace** and **Danbooru**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their sizes and characteristics.

In the **experiments** section, the authors confirm that they used the **iCartoonFace** and **Danbooru** datasets for their evaluations. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **iCartoonFace**, the citation is:
   > Y. Zheng, Y. Zhao, M. Ren, H. Yan, X. Lu, J. Liu, and J. Li. *Cartoon face recognition: A benchmark dataset*. In Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2020, pp. 2264â€“2272.

2. For **Danbooru**, the citation is:
   > Gwern Branwen. *Danbooru2018: A large-scale crowdsourced and tagged anime illustration dataset*. Available at: https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2018, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
