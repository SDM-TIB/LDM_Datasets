To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Towards a Rigorous Evaluation of XAI Methods on Time Series" by Udo Schlegel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets & Models)**, the authors list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention that they utilized **nine datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive** and an **ECG heartbeat dataset**. This section is crucial as it provides the names of the datasets and their sources.

The specific datasets mentioned are:

1. **FordA**
2. **FordB**
3. **ElectricDevices**
4. **MelbournePedestrian**
5. **ChlorineConcentration**
6. **Earthquakes**
7. **NonInvasiveFetalECGThorax1**
8. **NonInvasiveFetalECGThorax2**
9. **Strawberry**
10. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia** (from Physionet)

Next, I will look for the full citations for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference the UCR Time Series Classification Archive and the PhysioBank resource, which will help me find the complete citations.

For the UCR Time Series Classification Archive, the citation is:
> H. A. Dau, E. Keogh, K. Kamgar, C.-C. M. Yeh, Y. Zhu, S. Gharghabi, C. A. Ratanamahatana, Yanping, B. Hu, N. Begum, A. Bagnall, A. Mueen, and G. Batista. *The UCR Time Series Classification Archive*. Oct. 2018.

For the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset, the citation is:
> A. L. Goldberger, L. A. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. C. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C. K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley. *PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals*. Circulation, 101(23):E215â€“20, 2000.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
