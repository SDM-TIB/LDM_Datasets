To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Distillation: A Survey" by Jianping Gou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 7 (Applications)**, where the authors discuss various applications of knowledge distillation. Here, they might mention specific datasets used in the context of visual recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to datasets like "CIFAR10" or "ImageNet," I will highlight these mentions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the paper mentions "CIFAR10," I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. I will do this for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
