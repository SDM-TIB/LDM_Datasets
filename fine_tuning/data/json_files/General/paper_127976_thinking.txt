To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining Hate Speech Classification with Model-Agnostic Methods" by Durgesh Nandini and Ute Schmid, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research goals but does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the context of hate speech detection but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their case study. Here, they mention that they used a Twitter dataset derived from Davidson et al. (2017). The authors explain that the dataset was collected using the Twitter API, consisting of 85.4 million tweets from 33,458 users, and that they took a random sample of 25,000 tweets, which were then annotated by humans.

The dataset is characterized by three classes: 'Hate', 'Offensive', and 'None', with a detailed description of each class. This section confirms that the Twitter dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the Twitter dataset, the citation is:
  > Davidson, T., Warmsley, D., Macy, M., & Weber, I. (2017). Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (Vol. 11, pp. 512-515).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the citation is included accurately. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
