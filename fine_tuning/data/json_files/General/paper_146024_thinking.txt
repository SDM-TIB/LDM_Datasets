To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disruption of the mitochondrial network in a mouse model of Huntington's Disease visualized by in-tissue multiscale 3D electron microscopy" by E. Martin-Solana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mitochondrial disturbances in a mouse model of Huntington's Disease, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to the imaging techniques or animal models used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. The authors describe their findings based on imaging techniques like FIB/SEM and electron tomography, and they mention using brain tissue samples from a **10-month-old HD animal model (heterozygous zQ175)** and a corresponding wild-type control. This indicates that the datasets are likely derived from these specific animal models.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors detail the preparation of brain tissue samples and the imaging techniques used. They mention that they prepared samples from both the HD model and wild-type controls, which confirms the existence of datasets related to these samples.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets:

1. **Mouse Model Dataset**: This dataset includes brain tissue samples from the heterozygous zQ175 mouse model of Huntington's Disease and corresponding wild-type controls. The authors specify that they used a total of 8 and 5 medium-sized spiny neurons (MSSNs) from the HD model and control, respectively, for imaging.

2. **FIB/SEM Imaging Dataset**: This dataset consists of imaging data obtained from FIB/SEM tomography of the MSSNs. The authors describe acquiring stacks representing volumes of thickness ranging from 5 to 30 microns.

3. **Electron Tomography Dataset**: This dataset includes tomographic data from the electron tomography of MSSNs from a 9-month-old HD animal model (homozygous zQ175) and a corresponding wild-type control. The authors mention that they observed a total of 120 sections from cells compatible with striatal MSSNs.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

  > Menalled, L. B. et al. Comprehensive Behavioral and Molecular Characterization of a New Knock-In Mouse Model of Huntington’s Disease: zQ175. *PLoS ONE* 7, e49838 (2012).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its corresponding citation for future reference or analysis.
