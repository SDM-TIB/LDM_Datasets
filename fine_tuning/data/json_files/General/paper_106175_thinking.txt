To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARMAS: Active Reconstruction of Missing Audio Segments" by Zohra Cheddad and Abbas Cheddad, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the reconstruction of audio signals and mentions the use of various metrics for evaluation, which may imply the presence of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of audio signal reconstruction and reference previous works. I will look for any specific datasets that might have been used in those referenced studies.

In the **performance evaluation section**, the authors mention that they used a common audio benchmark comprising 10 files, including various musical instruments. This indicates that there is a dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **results sections**. Here, the authors specify that they used the same audio benchmark as in a previous work, which includes 10 audio files: Violin, Clarinet, Bassoon, Harp, Glockenspiel, Celesta, Accordion, Guitar, Piano, and Wind ensemble. This is crucial information for identifying the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work for the audio benchmark, which is crucial for proper citation.

After reviewing the references, I find that the dataset is associated with the following citation:
- For the audio benchmark dataset, the citation is:
  > O. Mokrý, P. Záviška, P. Rajmic, and V. Veselý. "Introducing SPAIN (SParse Audio INpainter)." In 2019 27th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), 2019, pp. 1-5. doi: 10.23919/EUSIPCO.2019.8902560.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name and its citation, ensuring that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the study.
