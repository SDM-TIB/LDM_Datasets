To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effects of the Nonlinearity in Activation Functions on the Performance of Deep Learning Models" by Nalinda Kulathunga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the investigation of model performance using different activation functions, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of activation functions in deep learning, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **methods section**, where the authors outline their objectives and the datasets used for their experiments.

In **Objective 1**, the authors specify that they used the **MNIST dataset** for their analysis. They describe it as consisting of 10,000 images of handwritten digits, with each image being a 28 × 28 grayscale pixel image. This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning.

In **Objective 2**, the authors mention using three datasets: 
1. **MNIST dataset** (again, for consistency in their experiments).
2. **FOOD-11 dataset**: This dataset contains 5,000 images for food classification tasks. The authors reference a paper that describes this dataset.
3. **Simulated continuous data**: This dataset consists of 10,000 instances with 16 features generated from a specific function with Gaussian noise.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun and C. Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **FOOD-11 dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Singla, L. Yuan, and T. Ebrahimi. *Food/non-food image classification and food categorization using pre-trained googlenet model*. In Proceedings of the 2nd International Workshop on MADiMa, 10 2016, pp. 3–11.

The simulated continuous data does not have a specific citation since it is generated data based on a function described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
