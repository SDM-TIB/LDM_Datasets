To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Commonsense Explanation by Extracting Bridge Concepts from Reasoning Paths" by Haozhe Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a commonsense explanation generation task and indicates that the authors conducted experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Commonsense Explanation Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Commonsense Validation and Explanation Challenge, containing 10,000 statements against commonsense, each with three human-written explanations. The authors also detail how they split the dataset into training, development, and test sets.

2. **Commonsense Knowledge Graph**: The authors utilize the English version of ConceptNet as their external commonsense knowledge graph, which consists of triples in the form of (head, relation, tail).

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Commonsense Explanation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Commonsense Validation and Explanation Challenge. Available at: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080.

- For the **ConceptNet**, the citation is:
  > Robyn Speer, Joshua Chin, and Catherine Havasi. *ConceptNet 5.5: An open multilingual graph of general knowledge*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 4444â€“4451, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
