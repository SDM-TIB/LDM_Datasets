To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Roads One Must Walk Down: Commute and Depression for Beijing’s Residents" by Xize Wang and Tao Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study uses survey data from **1,528 residents in Beijing**, which indicates that this survey data is a primary dataset for the research. I will note this dataset and look for more details in the methods section.

Next, I will proceed to the **data and methods section** (Section 3). Here, the authors describe the survey methodology in detail. They mention that the survey was conducted in Beijing between **November 2018 and April 2019**, covering **seven of Beijing’s 16 districts**. The sample size is confirmed to be **1,582 main respondents**, which is slightly different from the number mentioned in the abstract due to exclusions based on missing data.

In this section, I will also look for any specific datasets or scales used in the analysis. The authors mention using the **10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CESD-10)** to measure depressive symptoms. This scale is a well-known dataset in mental health research, and I will need to include it in my extraction.

I will also note the **socioeconomic profile variables** collected in the survey, which include gender, age, income, and occupation. These variables are essential for understanding the context of the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CESD-10 scale is widely used, and I can find its original citation:

- For the **CESD-10 scale**, the citation is:
  > Andersen, E. M., Malmgren, J. A., Carter, W. B., & Patrick, D. L. (1994). Screening for depression in well older adults: Evaluation of a short form of the CES-D. *American Journal of Preventive Medicine*, 10(2), 77-84.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format. The primary dataset is the survey data from Beijing residents, and the secondary dataset is the CESD-10 scale used for measuring depression.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets ready for inclusion in the final output. This systematic approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
