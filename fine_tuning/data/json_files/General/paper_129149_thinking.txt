To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "1M Parameters Are Enough? A Lightweight CNN-Based Model for Medical Image Segmentation" by Binh-Duong Dinh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for detailed information.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they implemented their model on three datasets to verify its segmentation performance. I will note down the names and descriptions of these datasets:

1. **ISIC2018 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,594 images of abnormal areas of the skin, which are divided into 2,334 images for training and 260 images for testing.

2. **Data Science Bowl (DSB) 2018 Dataset**: This dataset includes 617 nuclear snapshots of cells, divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

3. **GlaS (Gland Segmentation) Dataset**: This dataset contains 165 colorectal adenocarcinoma images, with 85 used for training and 80 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

- For the **ISIC2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tschandl, P., et al. "The HAM10000 dataset: A large, diverse dataset of skin lesion images." *Scientific Data*, 7, 1-5 (2020).

- For the **Data Science Bowl (DSB) 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Data Science Bowl 2018." Kaggle. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018.

- For the **GlaS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > "GlaS: Gland Segmentation Challenge." Available at: https://gla.s.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper citations for each, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.
