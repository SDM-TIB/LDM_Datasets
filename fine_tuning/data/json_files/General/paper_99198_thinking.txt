To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient DETR: Improving End-to-End Object Detector with Dense Prior" by Zhuyu Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **MS COCO** dataset and the **CrowdHuman** dataset, indicating that these are the primary datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that their experiments are conducted on the **MS COCO benchmark** and evaluate their method on the **CrowdHuman dataset**. This confirms that these two datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MS COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. For the **CrowdHuman dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shuai Shao, Zijian Zhao, Boxun Li, Tete Xiao, Gang Yu, Xiangyu Zhang, and Jian Sun. *Crowdhuman: A benchmark for detecting human in a crowd*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.00123, 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MS COCO**: A large-scale dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks, containing over 330k images with more than 2.5 million labeled instances across 80 object categories.

- **CrowdHuman**: A dataset specifically designed for human detection in crowded scenes, containing images with annotations for human bounding boxes, making it suitable for evaluating object detection algorithms in challenging scenarios.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for further processing or review.
