To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixerFlow: MLP-Mixer meets Normalising Flows" by Eshant English et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, I will look for any mentions of datasets that the authors have utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. Specifically, I will look at subsections such as **5.1 Density estimation on 32 × 32 datasets** and **5.2 Density estimation on 64 × 64 datasets**. Here, the authors mention the datasets they evaluated their model on, which include:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet32**: A downscaled version of the ImageNet dataset, specifically used for evaluating normalising flow models.
3. **AnimeFaces**: A dataset containing images of anime faces.
4. **ImageNet64**: Another version of the ImageNet dataset, but at a resolution of 64x64.
5. **Galaxy32**: A dataset of images of merging and non-merging galaxies, downsampled to 32x32 resolution.
6. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **ImageNet32**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A.C., Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. 

- For **AnimeFaces**:
  > Naftali, M.G., Sulistyawan, J.S., Julian, K. (2023). *Aniwho: A quick and accurate way to classify anime character faces in images*.

- For **ImageNet64**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A.C., Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*.

- For **Galaxy32**:
  > Ackermann, S., Schawinski, K., Zhang, C., Weigel, A.K., Turp, M.D. (2018). *Using transfer learning to detect galaxy mergers*. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 479(1), 415–425.

- For **MNIST**:
  > Deng, L. (2012). *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6), 141–142.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
