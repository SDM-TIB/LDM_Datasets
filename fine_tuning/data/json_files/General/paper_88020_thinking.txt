To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Viewpoint-Aware Loss with Angular Regularization for Person Re-Identification" by Zhihui Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Market-1501** and **DukeMTMC-reID** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology section, the authors describe the datasets in detail, stating that:

1. **Market-1501 Dataset**: This dataset contains 32,668 person images of 1,501 identities captured by six cameras. The training set consists of 12,936 images of 751 identities, while the testing set includes images of the remaining 750 identities, along with 2,793 distractors.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID Dataset**: This dataset includes 36,411 person images of 1,404 identities captured by eight cameras. The identities are randomly divided into a training set of 702 identities and a testing set of the remaining 702 identities, with one image per identity selected for the query set.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **experiments section**, where the authors confirm that they used both the **Market-1501** and **DukeMTMC-reID** datasets for their evaluations.

After confirming the datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Market-1501 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Shen, L., Tian, L., Wang, S., Wang, J., & Tian, Q. (2015). *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **DukeMTMC-reID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ristani, E., Solera, F., Zou, R., & Tomasi, C. (2016). *Performance metrics for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
