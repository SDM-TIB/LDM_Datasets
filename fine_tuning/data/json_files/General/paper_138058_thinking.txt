To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "PruneSymNet: A Symbolic Neural Network and Pruning Algorithm for Symbolic Regression" by Min Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was tested on a public dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental results)**, where the authors introduce six test datasets used in their study. The datasets are listed as follows:

1. **Koza Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of symbolic regression and is known for containing various mathematical expressions.

2. **Korns Dataset**: Similar to the Koza dataset, this one also contains mathematical expressions used for testing symbolic regression algorithms.

3. **ODE Dataset**: This dataset includes expressions derived from ordinary differential equations, which are commonly used in symbolic regression tasks.

4. **Livermore Dataset**: This dataset consists of mathematical expressions that are often used as benchmarks in symbolic regression studies.

5. **AIFeynman2 Dataset**: A subset of the AIFeynman dataset, which contains expressions with a limited number of variables.

6. **AIFeynman3 Dataset**: Another subset of the AIFeynman dataset, this one includes expressions with three variables.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Koza Dataset**, the citation is:

  > Silviu-Marian Udrescu et al. *AI Feynman 2.0: Pareto-optimal symbolic regression exploiting graph modularity*. In Proceedings of the conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems, December 2020.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
