To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi Supervised Segmentation and Graph-Based Tracking of 3D Nuclei in Time-Lapse Microscopy" by S. Shailja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, I will focus on **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC) 2020** dataset, which consists of 3D time-lapse video sequences of fluorescent counterstained nuclei microscopy images of C. elegans developing embryos. The details provided include the number of videos, dimensions, and ground truth annotations.

The dataset description includes:
- **Training Videos**: 2 videos with dimensions 512 × 708 × 35 and 512 × 712 × 31, each containing 250 frames.
- **Testing Videos**: 2 videos with dimensions 512 × 712 × 31, containing 190 and 140 frames respectively.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors reference their own work in the context of the CTC, which is crucial for proper citation. The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Shailja, S., Jiang, J., & Manjunath, B.S. (2020). UCSB-US. Cell Tracking Challenge.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, particularly in the discussion of results or comparisons with other methods. However, the primary dataset appears to be the CTC dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the CTC dataset as it is critical for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness in the information provided.
