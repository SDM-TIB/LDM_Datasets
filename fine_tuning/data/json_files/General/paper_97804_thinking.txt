To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directed particle swarm optimization with Gaussian-process-based function forecasting" by Johannes Jakubik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for computational experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CEC2013 suite of benchmark functions** for their experiments. This indicates that the datasets are related to optimization problems and are likely well-known in the field.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CEC2013 benchmark functions. The citation is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citation for the CEC2013 benchmark functions is:
> Liang, J., Qu, B., Suganthan, P., & Hernández-Díaz, A. G. (2013). Problem definitions and evaluation criteria for the CEC 2013 special session on real-parameter optimization. Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Technical Report, 201212, 281–295.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the CEC2013 benchmark functions. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
