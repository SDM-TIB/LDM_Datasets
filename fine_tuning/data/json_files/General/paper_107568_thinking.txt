To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransVOD: End-to-End Video Object Detection with Spatial-Temporal Transformers" by Qianyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **ImageNet VID dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **ImageNet VID dataset**. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the nature of the annotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **ImageNet VID dataset** as containing 3,862 training videos and 555 validation videos with annotated bounding boxes for 30 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

After gathering the dataset details, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the **ImageNet VID dataset**. The citation is typically formatted according to the journal's guidelines, and I will ensure to capture it accurately. The citation for the ImageNet VID dataset is:
> O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein et al., "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge," International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211-252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I followed to extract the dataset information are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated datasets section or relevant mentions in the methodology/experiments sections.
3. Note down the details of the **ImageNet VID dataset** as described in the paper.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.
5. Compile the information into a clear and structured format.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the dataset used in the research paper.
