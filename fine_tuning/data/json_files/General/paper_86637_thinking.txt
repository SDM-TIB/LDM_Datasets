To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiabDeep: Pervasive Diabetes Diagnosis based on Wearable Medical Sensors and Efficient Neural Networks" by Hongxu Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 4 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. Here, they mention that data was collected from **52 participants**, including both physiological data from wearable medical sensors and demographic information through questionnaires. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from this study.

In **subsection 4.1 (Data Collection and Preparation)**, the authors provide a detailed list of the types of data collected, which includes various physiological signals (e.g., Galvanic skin response, skin temperature, etc.) and demographic information (e.g., age, gender, weight). This section is crucial as it outlines the specific data types that comprise the dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the data is collected specifically for this study, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and derived from the authors' own research.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as well as a description of the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: DiabDeep Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset collected from 52 participants, including physiological signals from wearable medical sensors (Empatica E4 smartwatch and Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone) and demographic information gathered through questionnaires. The dataset includes various physiological measurements such as Galvanic skin response, skin temperature, and more.
   - **Citation**: Hongxu Yin, Bilal Mukadam, Xiaoliang Dai, and Niraj K. Jha. *DiabDeep: Pervasive Diabetes Diagnosis based on Wearable Medical Sensors and Efficient Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
