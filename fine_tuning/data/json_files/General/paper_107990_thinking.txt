To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PLATINUM: Semi-Supervised Model Agnostic Meta-Learning using Submodular Mutual Information" by Changbin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the experiments. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and CIFAR-FS datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In Section 4.1, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset consists of 100 classes, with each class containing 600 images. The authors mention that it is a modified subset of the ILSVRC-12 dataset, and they split it into 64 classes for training, 16 for validation, and 20 for testing.

2. **tieredImageNet**: This dataset is larger, containing 608 classes, with each class having between 768 to 1300 images. The classes are split into 351 for training, 97 for validation, and 160 for testing.

3. **CIFAR-FS**: This dataset contains 60,000 images across 100 classes, and the authors use the same class split as miniImageNet for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for these datasets, so I will use the following standard references based on common knowledge in the field:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Wierstra, D., et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 29:3630â€“3638, 2016.

- For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ren, M., Triantafillou, E., Ravi, S., Snell, J., Swersky, K., Tenenbaum, J. B., Larochelle, H., and Zemel, R. S. *Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

- For **CIFAR-FS**, the citation is:
  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P., and Vedaldi, A. *Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
