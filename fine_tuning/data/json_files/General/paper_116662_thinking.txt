To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of SMEs on Employment Creation in Makurdi Metropolis of Benue State" by Bridget Ngodoo Mile, Victor Ushahemba Ijirshar, and Mlumun Queen Ijirshar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction discusses the role of SMEs in employment creation, which may hint at the data sources used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their sampling technique and the sample size of 340 entrepreneurs. This indicates that there is a dataset derived from these entrepreneurs, but I need to find more specific details about the data collected.

In the **data presentation and analysis section**, I will look for tables or figures that summarize the data collected. For instance, Table 1 presents categorical descriptive statistics of the explanatory variables, and Table 2 provides information on the dependent variable related to employment creation. These tables suggest that the authors have compiled data on various factors affecting SMEs and their employment generation capabilities.

I will also check the **empirical review section** for any references to datasets used in previous studies, as these may provide context or additional datasets relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the original data sources.

For example, if the authors referenced specific datasets or studies that provided data on SMEs in Nigeria, I will ensure to extract and format those citations correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and includes the full citation. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the sample size, variables measured, and the context of the data collection.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the study.
