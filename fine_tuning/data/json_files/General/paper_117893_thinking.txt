To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence Functions for Sequence Tagging Models" by Sarthak Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper, as these sections typically provide insights into the datasets used for the research. In the abstract, the authors mention the practical utility of their method in identifying systematic annotation errors in two named entity recognition corpora, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this section, the authors refer to two datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CoNLL Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing news stories labeled with four entity types: PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC, using the BIO tagging scheme. The dataset is divided into train, validation, and test splits comprising 879, 194, and 197 documents, respectively.

2. **EBM-NLP Dataset**: This dataset consists of annotated medical article abstracts describing clinical randomized controlled trials. It includes a test set of 191 abstracts labeled by medical professionals, and a train/validation set of 3836/958 abstracts labeled via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

To ensure accuracy, I will cross-reference these mentions with the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CoNLL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Erik F. Tjong Kim Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147.

- For the **EBM-NLP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Benjamin Nye, Junyi Jessy Li, Roma Patel, Yinfei Yang, Iain Marshall, Ani Nenkova, and Byron Wallace. *A corpus with multi-level annotations of patients, interventions and outcomes to support language processing for medical literature*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 197–207, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
