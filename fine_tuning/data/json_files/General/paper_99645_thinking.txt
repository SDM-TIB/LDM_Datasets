To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A recipe for annotating grounded clarifications" by Luciana Benotti and Patrick Blackburn, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on dialogue clarification mechanisms, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. Here, the authors discuss the importance of grounding in dialogue but do not specify any datasets yet. However, they mention the need for a recipe for obtaining grounding annotations, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later.

I will then look into **section 4 (Grounded clariﬁcation annotation)**, where the authors describe their methodology and mention the **SCARE corpus**. This corpus is crucial as it is used to test their proposed annotation methodology. The SCARE corpus consists of fifteen English spontaneous dialogues situated in an instruction-giving task, with a minimum of 400 turns and a maximum of 1500 turns.

In this section, the authors also reference other datasets used in previous studies, including:

1. **Bielefeld Corpus**: This dataset includes dialogues in which one participant gives instructions in German to build a model plane. It consists of 22 dialogues with an average of 180 turns each.

2. **Communicator Corpus**: This dataset is a fragment of the Carnegie Mellon Communicator Corpus, which contains travel reservation dialogues between a client and a travel agent.

3. **BNC Corpus**: This dataset contains spoken British English dialogues collected during meetings.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the references section:

- For the **SCARE corpus**, the citation is:
  > Laura Stoia. *Noun Phrase Generation for Situated Dialogs*. Ph.D. thesis, Ohio State University, USA, 2007.

- For the **Bielefeld Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Kepa Rodríguez and David Schlangen. *Form, intonation and function of clarification requests in German task-oriented spoken dialogues*. In Proceedings of SEMDIAL, pages 101–108, 2004.

- For the **Communicator Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Christina L. Bennett and Alexander I. Rudnicky. *The Carnegie Mellon Communicator Corpus*. In Interspeech, 2002.

- For the **BNC Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Matthew Purver. *The Theory and Use of Clarification Requests in Dialogue*. Ph.D. thesis, King’s College, University of London, 2004.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are formatted correctly. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
