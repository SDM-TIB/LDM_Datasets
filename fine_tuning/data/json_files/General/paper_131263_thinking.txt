To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConSlide: Asynchronous Hierarchical Interaction Transformer with Breakup-Reorganize Rehearsal for Continual Whole Slide Image Analysis" by Yanyan Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed framework was evaluated on **four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their continual learning benchmark. They mention:

1. **Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)**: This dataset is part of the TCGA repository and is used for tumor subtype classification.
2. **Invasive Breast Carcinoma (BRCA)**: Another dataset from TCGA, also used for classification tasks.
3. **Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)**: This dataset includes two subtypes for consistency with other datasets.
4. **Esophageal Carcinoma (ESCA)**: The fourth dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since these datasets are derived from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), I will reference the TCGA as the source for these datasets. The citation for TCGA is:

> The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas*. Available at: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for TCGA as the source of the datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
