To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MANTRA: Memory Augmented Networks for Multiple Trajectory Prediction" by Francesco Marchetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on "three datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics or descriptions that clarify their use in the study.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset includes various annotations such as Velodyne LiDAR 3D scans, object bounding boxes, and tracks. The authors specify that they used a specific split of the KITTI dataset categorized as KITTI Raw Data, collecting 6-second chunks of trajectories for training and testing.

2. **Oxford RobotCar Dataset**: This dataset is adapted for trajectory prediction and is noted for its zero-shot transfer capabilities. The authors mention that it contains 6-second trajectories divided into 2 seconds for past and 4 seconds for future predictions.

3. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Similar to the Oxford RobotCar, this dataset has been adapted for trajectory prediction, with shorter videos and predictions made only up to one second in the future.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For the **Oxford RobotCar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Will Maddern, Geoffrey Pascoe, Chris Linegar, and Paul Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford RobotCar dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(1):3–15, 2017.

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and ready for further use or analysis.
