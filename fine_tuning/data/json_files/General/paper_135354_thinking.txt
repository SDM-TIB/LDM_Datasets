To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "EAFP-Med: An Efficient Adaptive Feature Processing Module Based on Prompts for Medical Image Detection" by Xiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three datasets related to medical imaging, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Chest X-ray Image Dataset (CXrI)**: This dataset consists of images categorized into three classes: COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia, with 2300 images in each category.

2. **Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging Image Dataset (CMRI)**: This dataset includes images from four categories: mild demented, moderate demented, non-demented, and very mild demented, with 4800 images in each category.

3. **Skin Image Dataset (SK)**: This dataset contains images from four categories: chickenpox, measles, monkeypox, and normal, with 1200 images in each category.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Chest X-ray Image Dataset (CXrI)**, the citation is:
  > Asraf, A. (2021). "COVID-19, Pneumonia, Normal Chest X-ray PA Dataset." Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanullahasraf/covid19-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-pa-dataset.

- For the **Cranial Magnetic Resonance Imaging Image Dataset (CMRI)**, the citation is:
  > Uraninjo, D. (2022). "Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset V2." Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset-v2.

- For the **Skin Image Dataset (SK)**, the citation is:
  > Bala, D. (2022). "Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset (MSID)." Available: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipuiucse/monkeypoxskinimagedataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
