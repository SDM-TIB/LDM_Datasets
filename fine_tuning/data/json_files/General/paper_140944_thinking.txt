To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adapprox: Adaptive Approximation in Adam Optimization via Randomized Low-Rank Matrices" by Pengxiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of the Adapprox optimizer on the **GPT-2** model, which suggests that datasets related to this model may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **experiments** or **methodology**. In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their evaluation setup, including the datasets used for training and testing the models. 

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using **The Pile dataset** for pretraining the GPT-2 models. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context in which the Adapprox optimizer was evaluated.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for **The Pile dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., et al. *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also evaluate their models on several downstream tasks, including **SQuAD v1.1**, **CoLA**, **MRPC**, **SST-2**, and **MNLI-m**. Each of these tasks typically has associated datasets.

I will look up the citations for these datasets as well:

1. **SQuAD v1.1**:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., and Liang, P. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

2. **CoLA**:
   > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., and Bowman, S. R. *Neural network acceptability judgments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471, 2018.

3. **MRPC**:
   > Dolan, B. and Brockett, C. *Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases*. In Third International Workshop on Paraphrasing (IWP2005), 2005.

4. **SST-2**:
   > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pp. 1631â€“1642, 2013.

5. **MNLI-m**:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., and Bowman, S. R. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
