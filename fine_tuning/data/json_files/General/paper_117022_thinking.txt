To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AlphaTuning: Quantization-Aware Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Large-Scale Pre-Trained Language Models" by Se Jung Kwon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of adapting large-scale language models and mention various applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **WebNLG**: This dataset is used for data-to-text generation tasks and consists of 25,298 (data, text) pairs. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Gardent, C., Shimorina, A., Narayan, S., & Perez-Beltrachini, L. (2017). The WebNLG challenge: Generating text from RDF data. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 124–133.

2. **DART**: This dataset is an open-domain text generation dataset with 82k examples, extracted from several datasets including WebNLG 2017 and Cleaned E2E. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Nan, L., Radev, D. R., Zhang, R., Rau, A., Sivaprasad, A., Hsieh, C., Tang, X., Vyas, A., Verma, N., Krishna, P., et al. (2021). DART: Open-domain structured data record to text generation. In NAACL-HLT.

3. **E2E**: This dataset is used for training end-to-end and data-driven natural language generation tasks, consisting of about 50k instances. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Novikova, J., Dušek, O., & Rieser, V. (2017). The E2E dataset: New challenges for end-to-end generation. In Proceedings of the 18th Annual SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 201–206.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **MNLI** dataset for evaluating sentence understanding performance. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112–1122.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ready for further processing or review.
