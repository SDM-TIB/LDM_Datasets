To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finite-Sample Identification of Linear Regression Models with Residual-Permuted Sums" by Szabolcs Szentpéteri and Balázs Csanád Csáji, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their method and validate it through numerical experiments, which typically involve specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any numerical experiments or simulations mentioned, as they often indicate the datasets used.

If the paper does not explicitly list datasets, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide dataset information. This is crucial because datasets are often introduced in the context of previous studies.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to gather the necessary details for each dataset, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which is essential for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would look for its description and citation in the references. 

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its name, description, and citation. This will facilitate easy access and reference for future use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
