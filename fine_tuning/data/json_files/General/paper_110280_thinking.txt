To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CMOS Circuit Implementation of Spiking Neural Network for Pattern Recognition Using On-chip Unsupervised STDP Learning" by Sahibia Kaur Vohra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous works, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and may reference specific datasets used for training and testing their spiking neural network (SNN).

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **heart rate classification dataset** derived from the PhysioBank ATM database. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments, and I need to ensure I capture its details accurately.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PhysioBank ATM dataset. The citation typically includes the authors, title, source, and publication details, which are essential for proper attribution.

After gathering the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset in a clear format, ensuring to include:

1. **Dataset Name**: PhysioBank ATM
2. **Description**: A dataset used for heart rate classification, containing ECG data.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference as found in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
