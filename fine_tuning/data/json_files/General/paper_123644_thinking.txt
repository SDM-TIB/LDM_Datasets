To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SPOTR: Spatio-temporal Pose Transformers for Human Motion Prediction" by Avinash Ajit Nargund and Misha Sra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of human motion prediction and may reference datasets that are commonly used in this field. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is described as the most popular human motion dataset for benchmarking pose prediction tasks. It contains 3.6 million poses represented by a skeleton of 32 joints, with 15 actions performed by 7 subjects. The authors detail the preprocessing steps taken with the dataset.

2. **CMU Motion Capture**: This dataset contains motion data of humans performing various actions, represented by a skeleton of 38 joints. The authors mention that they preprocess the pose sequences similarly to the Human3.6M dataset for fair comparison.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

For the **Human3.6M dataset**, the citation is:
> Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325â€“1339, 2013.

For the **CMU Motion Capture dataset**, the citation is:
> CMU Graphics Lab. *CMU Graphics Lab Motion Capture*, 2000.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
