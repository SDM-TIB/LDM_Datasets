To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMs Meet Long Video: Advancing Long Video Comprehension with An Interactive Visual Adapter in LLMs" by Yunxin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various video understanding benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **WebVid**: This dataset consists of 703,000 video-text pairs, which were used for training the causal transformer.
2. **Video-ChatGPT**: A dataset containing 100,000 video-text instruction pairs, utilized for the Video Instruction Tuning stage.
3. **Valley-Instruct-73k**: This dataset includes 36,000 short video-text instruction pairs, also used for Video Instruction Tuning.
4. **NExT-QA**: A multiple-choice QA dataset with 34,000 instances, contributing to the instructional datasets.
5. **ActivityNet-QA**: A benchmark for long video QA tasks.
6. **Social-IQ 2.0**: Another benchmark for long video QA tasks.
7. **LifeQA**: A dataset for real-life video question answering.
8. **WildQA**: A dataset for in-the-wild video question answering.
9. **MSVD-QA**: A benchmark for short video QA tasks.
10. **MSRVTT-QA**: Another benchmark for short video QA tasks.
11. **SEED-Bench**: A benchmark that includes various tasks related to short videos.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will need to gather include:
