To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Camera Motion Blur Removing: How to Handle Outliers in Deblurring" by Meng Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on public test datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, I will look for a dedicated section on datasets, which is often labeled as "Datasets" or something similar.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **GoPro Dataset**: This dataset is formed from high-frame-rate video sequences captured by a GoPro Hero 4 camera. The blurred images are generated by averaging consecutive short-exposure frames. The authors note that this dataset is widely applied in dynamic scene deblurring studies.

2. **Kohler's Dataset**: This dataset consists of 48 images with 12 different kernels, created by recording real camera motion from videos. It serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating camera motion deblurring approaches.

3. **Lai's Dataset**: This dataset includes three parts: a uniform-blur part, a nonuniform-blur part, and a real-world blur part. The authors mention that it consists of 100 real blurred images published in previous deblurring works.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **GoPro Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Kohler's Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Köhler, R., Hirsch, M., Mohler, B., Schölkopf, B., & Harmeling, S. (2012). Recording and playback of camera shake: Benchmarking blind deconvolution with a real-world database. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 27-40.

- For **Lai's Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references as required.
