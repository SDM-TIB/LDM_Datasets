To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust UCB Scheme for Active Learning in Regression from Strategic Crowds" by Divya Padmanabhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of crowdsourcing for labeling data, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets from the UCI repository: **Housing**, **Redwine**, and **Whitewine**. I will note the details provided for each dataset, including size and dimensionality.

The details extracted from Section 6.1 indicate:
1. **Housing Dataset**: Size: 4898 instances, Dimensionality: 11, Nonlinear transformation applied.
2. **Redwine Dataset**: Size: 506 instances, Dimensionality: 12, Nonlinear transformation applied.
3. **Whitewine Dataset**: Size: 1599 instances, Dimensionality: 11, Linear transformation applied.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a common source for datasets in machine learning research.

The citation for the UCI repository is:
> Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCI repository as it serves as the source for all three datasets.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
