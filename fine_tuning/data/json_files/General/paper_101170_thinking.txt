To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DNN-based Topology Optimisation: Spatial Invariance and Neural Tangent Kernel" by Benjamin Dupuis and Arthur Jacot, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss using a DNN to generate density fields for topology optimization. They mention that their implementation is based on existing methods, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

I will also look for any **experimental results** sections, as these often detail the datasets used for validation or testing. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their characteristics, size, and purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors reference two key datasets:

1. **SIMP Method Dataset**: While the paper does not provide a specific dataset name, it refers to datasets used in traditional SIMP methods. I will need to find the original references for these datasets.

2. **Numerical Experiments**: The authors mention that their implementation will be made public on GitHub, which may include datasets or links to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For example, if they reference the original SIMP method, I would look for the citation:
- Erik Andreassen, Anders Clausen, Mattias Schevenels, Boyan Lazarov, and Ole Sigmund. "Efficient topology optimization in matlab using 88 lines of code." *Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization*, 43:1â€“16, 2011.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including full citations, into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and can be easily accessed by others interested in this research area.
