To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Smoothing is Robustification against Model Misspecification" by Ryoya Yamasaki and Toshiyuki Tanaka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments" or "Methodology"**. In this paper, I will focus on the sections where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets they utilized.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The final output will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately for future reference.
