To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UGIF: UI Grounded Instruction Following" by Sagar Gubbi Venkatesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of **UGIF-DataSet**, which is a multi-lingual, multi-modal dataset for UI grounded instruction following. This indicates that there is a dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (UGIF-DataSet)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe it as containing **4,184 tasks across 8 languages**, with a focus on how-to queries and corresponding UI actions. This section will give me the necessary details about the dataset's structure, purpose, and the languages included.

In this section, I will note the following key points about **UGIF-DataSet**:
- It consists of **523 how-to queries per language**.
- Each query includes step-by-step instructions in English and a sequence of UI screenshots and actions.
- The dataset is designed for evaluating retrieval, parsing, and instruction following in Android.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that the dataset is used for evaluation purposes, which will further validate its significance in the research.

Now, I will need to find the full citation for **UGIF-DataSet**. The authors mention that they will publicly release the dataset in the camera-ready version, but I will look for any references or citations provided in the **References section** that might relate to the dataset or its creation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the dataset is built upon prior work, specifically referencing the **PixelHelp dataset** from Li et al. (2020a). Therefore, I will include the citation for this prior dataset as well, as it provides context for the development of UGIF-DataSet.

The full citation for **PixelHelp dataset** is:
> Yang Li, Jiacong He, Xin Zhou, Yuan Zhang, and Jason Baldridge. *Mapping natural language instructions to mobile UI action sequences*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.03776, 2020.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for **UGIF-DataSet** and any relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
