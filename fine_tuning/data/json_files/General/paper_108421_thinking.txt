To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solvability of Differential Riccati Equations and Applications to Algorithmic Trading with Signals" by FayÃ§al Drissi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for the algorithmic trading problems discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or results sections** of the paper, as these sections typically detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the author discusses two algorithmic trading problems. I will check if any datasets are referenced in the context of these problems. If the author mentions specific datasets or provides citations for them, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Market Data from XYZ Exchange," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, purpose, and citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and easily accessible for future reference.
