To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Compute-Efficient Medical Image Classification with Softmax-Free Transformers and Sequence Normalization" by Firas Khader et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials & methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions evaluating the method across various medical imaging datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials & Methods)**, specifically the subsection **2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list several datasets along with their characteristics:

1. **Fundoscopic Images**: This dataset consists of 101,442 images sourced from the AIROGS challenge, with labels indicating the presence of referable glaucoma. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Dermascopic Images**: The ISIC dataset contains 33,126 dermascopic images of skin lesions from 2,056 patients, also split into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Chest Radiographs**: This dataset includes 15,000 chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset, with a consensus rating from multiple radiologists serving as the ground truth.

4. **Breast MRI Scans**: A dataset of 3D breast cancer MRI scans from 922 female patients, which has been processed and split into training, validation, and test sets.

5. **Whole-Slide Images**: The TCGA-NSCLC dataset, which includes histological whole-slide images, is also mentioned. It consists of two sub-datasets for lung cancer classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
