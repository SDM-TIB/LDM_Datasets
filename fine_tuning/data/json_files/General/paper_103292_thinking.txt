To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multistage Pruning of CNN Based ECG Classifiers for Edge Devices" by Li Xiaolin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses the use of CNNs for ECG classification but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of deploying deep learning models on wearable devices and mention the use of a baseline model for ECG classification. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section.

Moving on to **section III (Baseline Model)**, I will look for any datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention that they extract QRS complexes from a dataset based on annotations and specifically reference the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database** as the dataset used for ECG classification. This is a key dataset, and I will need to note its details.

In the **results and discussion section (V)**, the authors confirm that they applied their pruning strategies on the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset**. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. The citation provided in the paper is:
> G. B. Moody and R. G. Mark, “The impact of the mit-bih arrhythmia database,” IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine, vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 45–50, 2001.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database**: This dataset is used for ECG classification tasks and is crucial for evaluating the performance of the proposed pruning techniques.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
