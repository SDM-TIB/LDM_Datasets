To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Variational Inference for Online Supervised Learning" by Parth Paritosh, Nikolay Atanasov, and Sonia MartÃ­nez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a scalable distributed probabilistic inference algorithm but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VI) where the authors evaluate their algorithms. Here, they mention using specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details.

In Section VI, the authors reference two datasets:

1. **Banana Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,300 points with binary labels, used for binary classification tasks. The authors mention achieving 88% classification accuracy on the test set.

2. **Intel LiDAR Dataset**: This dataset is used for cooperative mapping problems, where robots collect occupancy information from LiDAR scans. The authors describe how the dataset is structured and how it is utilized in their experiments.

Additionally, they mention a third dataset:

3. **DiNNO Dataset**: This dataset simulates LiDAR samples collected by multiple robots following independent trajectories. The authors provide details about the dataset's structure and the challenges it presents.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the datasets' origins.

- For the **Banana Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bordes, A., Ertekin, S., Weston, J., Botton, L., & Cristianini, N. (2005). Fast kernel classifiers with online and active learning. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 6(9), 2005.

- For the **Intel LiDAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Howard, A., & Roy, N. (2003). The robotics data set repository (radish).

- For the **DiNNO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yu, J., Vincent, J. A., & Schwager, M. (2022). DiNNO: Distributed neural network optimization for multi-robot collaborative learning. *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*, 7(2), 1896-1903.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
