To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SMASH: One-Shot Model Architecture Search through HyperNetworks" by Andrew Brock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention validating their method on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **STL-10**: A dataset for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 5,000 training images and 8,000 test images.
4. **ModelNet10**: A dataset for 3D object classification containing 10 categories of 3D shapes.
5. **Imagenet32x32**: A downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset, used for image classification tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Coates, H. Lee, and A.Y. Ng. *An Analysis of Single Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In AISTATS 2011.

- For **ModelNet10**, the citation is:
  > Z. Wu, S. Song, A. Khosla, F. Yu, L. Zhang, X. Tang, and J. Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In CVPR 2015.

- For **Imagenet32x32**, the citation is:
  > P. Chrabaszcz, I. Loshchilov, and F. Hutter. *A Downsampled Variant of ImageNet as an Alternative to the CIFAR Datasets*. arXiv Preprint arXiv:1707.08819, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations.
