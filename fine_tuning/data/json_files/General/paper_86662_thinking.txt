To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Imitating by Generating: Deep Generative Models for Imitation of Interactive Tasks" by Judith Bütepage et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **human-human interaction data** and **human-robot interaction data** for four interactive tasks: "hand-shake," "hand-wave," "parachute fist-bump," and "rocket fist-bump." This suggests that there are specific datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on data collection or datasets**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the data collection process in **section 4 (Experimental setup and model fitting)**. They mention that they collected data from both human-human and human-robot interactions, specifying the number of trials and duration for each action type.

The relevant datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Human-Human Interaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings of two participants performing four actions (hand-shake, hand-wave, parachute fist-bump, and rocket fist-bump). The statistics provided indicate that there were 38 trials for hand-shake, 31 for hand-wave, 49 for parachute, and 70 for rocket, with varying durations.

2. **Human-Robot Interaction Dataset**: This dataset includes recordings of a human participant performing the same four actions with a robot. The authors report that there were 10 trials for each action type, with similar duration statistics as the human-human dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are original data collected by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the datasets:

- **Citation for the paper**:
  > Judith Bütepage, Ali Ghadirzadeh, Özge Öztimur Karadağ, Mårten Björkman, Danica Kragic. *Imitating by Generating: Deep Generative Models for Imitation of Interactive Tasks*. Preprint, October 15, 2019.

With this information, I can now create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the citations are included appropriately.
