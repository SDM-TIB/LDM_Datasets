To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Phase Noise: Analysis and Countermeasures" by Martin Dahl and Erik G. Larsson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of simulations to demonstrate the proposed scheme, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this paper, the authors mention that they tested their proposed scheme in an image classification setting using the **MNIST digits dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the methodology or results sections. The authors describe how they sorted the MNIST training dataset into 20 shards, each containing 3,000 samples, which indicates a specific use of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

> Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation and any relevant details about the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of samples and the nature of the data.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
