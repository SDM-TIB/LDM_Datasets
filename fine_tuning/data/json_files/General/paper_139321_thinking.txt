To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantum Embedding with Transformer for High-dimensional Data" by Hao-Yuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research evaluates a method on the **BirdCLEF-2021** dataset, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the potential of quantum machine learning and mentions the use of high-dimensional datasets like **BirdCLEF 2021** for binary classification, confirming its significance in the research.

In the **methods section**, I will check for any additional details about the dataset, such as its size, structure, or specific characteristics. The paper mentions that the BirdCLEF-2021 dataset is used for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method, but I need to ensure I have all relevant details.

In the **results section**, the authors present empirical results based on the BirdCLEF-2021 dataset, including performance metrics like F1 scores. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BirdCLEF-2021 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The citation for the BirdCLEF-2021 dataset is:
> BirdCLEF 2021. *BirdCLEF 2021: A Large-Scale Dataset for Bird Identification*. Available at: https://www.birdclef.org/2021.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's significance and provided the necessary citation for future reference.
