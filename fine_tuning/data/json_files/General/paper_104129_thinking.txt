To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delve into the Performance Degradation of Differentiable Architecture Search" by Jiuling Zhang and Zhiming Ding, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on multiple datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of neural architecture search (NAS) and mention the use of **NAS-BENCH-201** as a primary experimental platform. This suggests that NAS-BENCH-201 is one of the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where they specify that they chose **NAS-BENCH-201** for its ability to reproduce performance degradation under default settings. They also mention that this dataset allows for computationally affordable studies of bilevel optimization dynamics. 

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their experimental setups and results, confirming that they utilized **NAS-BENCH-201** for their evaluations. They also reference other datasets indirectly through comparisons with existing methods, but the primary dataset mentioned is NAS-BENCH-201.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for **NAS-BENCH-201**. The citation is:
> Xuanyi Dong and Yi Yang. *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Since NAS-BENCH-201 is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: NAS-BENCH-201
   - **Description**: A benchmark dataset for neural architecture search that allows for reproducible experiments and studies of bilevel optimization dynamics.
   - **Full Citation**: Xuanyi Dong and Yi Yang. *NAS-Bench-201: Extending the Scope of Reproducible Neural Architecture Search*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details along with the necessary citations.
