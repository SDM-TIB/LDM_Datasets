To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval Pipelines with Query Variation Generators" by Gustavo Penha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a taxonomy based on the manual annotation of transformations occurring in a dataset called **UQV100**. This indicates that UQV100 is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **TREC-DL-2019**: This dataset is used for the passage retrieval task and contains 43 queries in its test set.
2. **ANTIQUE**: This dataset is utilized for the non-factoid question answering task and contains 200 queries in its test set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UQV100**, the citation is:
  > Peter Bailey, Alistair Moffat, Falk Scholer, and Paul Thomas. *UQV100: A test collection with query variability*. In Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 725–728, 2016.

- For **TREC-DL-2019**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2019 Deep Learning Track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820, 2020.

- For **ANTIQUE**, the citation is:
  > Helia Hashemi, Mohammad Aliannejadi, Hamed Zamani, and W Bruce Croft. *ANTIQUE: A non-factoid question answering benchmark*. In European Conference on Information Retrieval, pages 166–173, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
