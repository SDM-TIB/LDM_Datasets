To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can Single-Shuffle SGD be Better than Reshuffling SGD and GD?" by Chulhee Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for specific mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MNIST," I will look for the original paper or source that describes the MNIST dataset and provide the full citation. 

If the paper includes any custom datasets created by the authors, I will document those as well, ensuring to capture any details about how they were generated or what they contain.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, making it easier for others to understand and access the data referenced in the paper.
