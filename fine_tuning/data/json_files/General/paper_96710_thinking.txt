To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GTA: Global Temporal Attention for Video Action Understanding" by Bo He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three video action recognition datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to:

1. **Something-Something v1**: This dataset is highlighted as a temporal-related dataset used for action recognition. The authors mention that their approach achieves state-of-the-art results on this dataset.

2. **Something-Something v2**: Similar to v1, this dataset is also used for evaluating the proposed method, and the authors report performance metrics for it.

3. **Kinetics-400**: This is another large-scale dataset mentioned in the paper, which is less sensitive to temporal relationships compared to the Something-Something datasets. The authors also report their performance on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Something-Something v1 and v2**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Fruend, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The "Something Something" video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
