To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot One-Class Classification via Meta-Learning" by Ahmed Frikha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **eight datasets from the image and time-series domains**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Baselines and Datasets)**, where the authors provide a list of datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Multi-Task MNIST (MT-MNIST)**: A dataset derived from MNIST, used for one-class classification tasks.
2. **Omniglot**: A dataset containing handwritten characters from various alphabets, used for binary classification tasks.
3. **MiniImageNet**: A benchmark dataset for few-shot learning, adapted for one-class classification tasks.
4. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning benchmark derived from CIFAR-100, also adapted for one-class classification.
5. **FC100**: Another few-shot learning benchmark derived from CIFAR-100, with different superclasses for training, validation, and testing.
6. **Synthetic Time-Series (STS)**: Two synthetic datasets (STS-Sawtooth and STS-Sine) created for anomaly detection tasks.
7. **CNC Milling Machine Data (CNC-MMD)**: A real-world dataset of sensor readings from industrial manufacturing processes.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

  > This dataset is proposed by the authors and will be published upon paper acceptance.

- **CNC Milling Machine Data (CNC-MMD)**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
