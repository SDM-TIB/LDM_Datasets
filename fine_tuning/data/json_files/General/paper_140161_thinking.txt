To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking the Backward Propagation for Adversarial Transferability" by Xiaosen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical results on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) for any detailed descriptions of datasets used in the study. In section 4.1, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they randomly sampled **5,000 images from the ILSVRC 2012 validation set**, which is a part of the ImageNet dataset. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the primary focus appears to be on the ImageNet dataset, as it is repeatedly referenced throughout the methodology and results sections.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet dataset**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115:211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
