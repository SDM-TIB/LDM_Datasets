To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from a Lightweight Teacher for Efficient Knowledge Distillation" by Yuang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "several public datasets with different modalities," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will delve into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of classes or instances.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10**: A widely used image classification benchmark consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, also containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
3. **THUCNews**: A Chinese text classification dataset with 200,000 news headlines across 10 categories, segmented for training, validation, and testing.
4. **ToutiaoNews**: A dataset collected from a news platform, containing 382,688 text instances across 15 categories.
5. **UCF101**: A dataset for human action recognition, consisting of 101 action classes and over 13,000 video clips.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. [Online] Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **THUCNews**:
  > THUCTC. *THUCNews: A Chinese Text Classification Dataset*. [Online] Available: http://thuctc.thunlp.org/

- For **ToutiaoNews**:
  > Toutiao. *Toutiao News Classification Dataset*. [Online] Available: https://github.com/skdjfla/toutiao-text-classfication-dataset

  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild*. Arxiv abs/1212.0402 (2012).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be utilized effectively in future work.
