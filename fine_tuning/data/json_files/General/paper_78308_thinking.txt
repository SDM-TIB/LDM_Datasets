To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Uncertain Convolutional Features for Accurate Saliency Detection" by Pingping Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a novel deep fully convolutional network model for saliency detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of the proposed methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention that they used the **MSRA10K dataset** for training and six widely used saliency detection datasets for evaluation:

1. **DUT-OMRON**: This dataset consists of 5,168 high-quality images with one or more salient objects and complex backgrounds.
2. **ECSSD**: Contains 1,000 natural images with semantically meaningful and complex structures in the ground truth segmentations.
3. **HKU-IS**: Comprises 4,447 images with high-quality pixel-wise annotations, including multiple disconnected objects or objects touching the image boundary.
4. **PASCAL-S**: A carefully selected subset from the PASCAL VOC dataset, containing 850 images.
5. **SED**: This dataset has two subsets, SED1 with 100 images containing one salient object and SED2 with 100 images containing two salient objects.
6. **SOD**: Contains 300 images originally designed for image segmentation, with pixel-wise annotations of salient objects.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
