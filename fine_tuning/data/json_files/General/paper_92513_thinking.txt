To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Principal Component Networks: Parameter Reduction Early in Training" by Roger Waleffe and Theodoros Rekatsinas, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** more closely, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their empirical validation. Here, they explicitly mention using **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** for training and testing their models. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the paper, the authors describe the **CIFAR-10 dataset** as consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, split into 10 classes. The **ImageNet dataset** is mentioned as containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scale and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
