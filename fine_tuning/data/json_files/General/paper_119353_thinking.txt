To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Mean Teacher for Continual and Gradual Test-Time Adaptation" by Mario Döbler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on several benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of domain shifts during test-time and mention the benchmarks they will evaluate their method on. This section will likely provide insights into the specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10C**: This dataset is designed to benchmark the robustness of classification networks and includes various corruptions applied to the CIFAR-10 dataset.

2. **CIFAR100C**: Similar to CIFAR10C, this dataset benchmarks robustness but is based on the CIFAR-100 dataset, which has more classes and is more challenging.

3. **Imagenet-C**: This dataset includes various corruptions applied to the ImageNet dataset, allowing for the evaluation of robustness under different conditions.

4. **ImageNet-R**: This dataset contains renditions of ImageNet classes, providing a different perspective on domain shifts.

5. **DomainNet-126**: A new benchmark introduced in this paper, consisting of four domains (real, clipart, painting, sketch) and 126 classes, which allows for the investigation of continual test-time adaptation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR10C** and **CIFAR100C**, the original CIFAR datasets are cited as:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Imagenet-C**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

- For **ImageNet-R**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Norman Mu, Saurav Kadavath, Frank Wang, Evan Dorundo, Rahul Desai, Tyler Zhu, Samyak Parajuli, Mike Guo, et al. *The Many Faces of Robustness: A Critical Analysis of Out-of-Distribution Generalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 8340–8349, 2021.

- For **DomainNet-126**, the citation is:
  > Kuniaki Saito, Donghyun Kim, Stan Sclaroff, Trevor Darrell, and Kate Saenko. *Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation via Minimax Entropy*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 8050–8058, 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
