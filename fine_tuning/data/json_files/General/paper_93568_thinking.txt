To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bone Segmentation in Contrast Enhanced Whole-Body Computed Tomography" by Patrick Leydon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved results on **two internal datasets and one external test dataset**, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly the subsections detailing the training and testing data. Here, the authors describe the datasets used:

1. **Internal Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1574 axial CT images of size 512 x 512, collected from 11 PET-CT scans. The authors mention that these scans were anonymized and collected under specific inclusion criteria.

2. **Internal Testing Dataset 1**: This dataset includes 228 axial CT images of size 512 x 512, also collected from the same PET-CT scanner and using the same low dose WB protocol as the training data.

3. **Internal Testing Dataset 2**: This dataset is similar to the first internal testing dataset, also comprising 228 axial CT images of size 512 x 512, collected under the same conditions.

4. **External Testing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 270 images from 27 axial small CT volumes in 20 patients, made publicly available by Perz-Carrasco et al. The authors note that this dataset was used solely for testing purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Internal Training Dataset**, since it is based on the authors' own data collection, there is no external citation needed.

- For the **Internal Testing Datasets**, similar to the training dataset, these are also based on the authors' own data collection, so no external citation is required.

- For the **External Testing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P´erez-Carrasco JA, Acha B, Suárez-Mejías C, López-Guerra JL, Serrano C. *Joint segmentation of bones and muscles using an intensity and histogram-based energy minimization approach*. Computer methods and programs in biomedicine. 2018;156:85–95.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the necessary citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
