To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Learning for Gastritis Detection with Gastric X-ray Images" by Guang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study uses a few annotated gastric X-ray images for gastritis detection, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly the subsection titled **3.1 Dataset**, where the authors describe the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the medical data were provided by The University of Tokyo Hospital in Japan, which includes gastric X-ray images of 815 patients (240 positive and 575 negative). This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of images and their resolution.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **Results** or **Discussion** sections, but it seems that the primary dataset is the gastric X-ray images from The University of Tokyo Hospital.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous study that likely provides more context about the dataset. The relevant citation is:

- Togo, R., Yamamichi, N., Mabe, K., Takahashi, Y., Takeuchi, C., Kato, M., Sakamoto, N., Ishihara, K., Ogawa, T., Haseyama, M. (2019). *Detection of gastritis by a deep convolutional neural network from double-contrast upper gastrointestinal barium X-ray radiography*. Journal of Gastroenterology, 54(4), 321–329.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Gastric X-ray Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of gastric X-ray images from 815 patients, with a resolution of 2,048 × 2,048 pixels. It includes 240 positive cases (gastritis) and 575 negative cases (non-gastritis). The dataset was used for training and testing the proposed self-supervised learning method for gastritis detection.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the dataset used in the study.
