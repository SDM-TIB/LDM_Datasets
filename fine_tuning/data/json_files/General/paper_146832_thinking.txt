To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Foundational Autoraters: Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation" by Tu Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that FLAMe is trained on a collection of **100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The FLAMe Collection)**, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors describe their data collection principles and list various datasets used for training FLAMe. I will carefully extract the names of the datasets along with their descriptions and the specific capabilities they cover.

I will also check **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors evaluate their models using various benchmarks. This section may contain additional datasets that were used for evaluation purposes, which are crucial for understanding the scope of their work.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

From my review of the paper, I expect to find datasets such as:

1. **HelpSteer**: A dataset for evaluating helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity.
   - Citation: Wang et al. (2023b). *HelpSteer: Multi-attribute helpfulness dataset for SteerLM*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09528.

2. **PRM800K**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning.
   - Citation: Lightman et al. (2024). *PRM800K: A dataset for mathematical reasoning*. In The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

3. **WebGPT**: A dataset for evaluating the performance of models in a web browsing context.
   - Citation: Nakano et al. (2021). *WebGPT: Browser-assisted question-answering with human feedback*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.09332.

4. **SummEval**: A dataset for evaluating summarization quality.
   - Citation: Fabbri et al. (2021). *SummEval: Re-evaluating summarization evaluation*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL).

5. **XSum Hallucination**: A dataset for evaluating factual accuracy in summarization.
   - Citation: Maynez et al. (2020). *On faithfulness and factuality in abstractive summarization*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
