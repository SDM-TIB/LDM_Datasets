To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aesthetic Attributes Assessment of Images" by Xin Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **DPC-Captions**, which is crucial for the study. The introduction provides context about the datasets used in the research, specifically highlighting the **PCCD dataset** and its characteristics.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the **DPC-Captions dataset** is introduced in section 3, where the authors explain its construction and significance. They mention that it contains **154,384 images and 2,427,483 comments**, which is essential information for describing the dataset.

Additionally, the authors reference the **PCCD dataset** in the introduction and provide details about it in section 3. They state that the PCCD dataset contains **4,235 images and 29,645 comments**. This dataset is also important for understanding the context of their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **DPC-Captions dataset**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:
   > Xin Jin, Le Wu, Geng Zhao, Xiaodong Li, Xiaokun Zhang, Shiming Ge, Dongqing Zou, Bin Zhou, and Xinghui Zhou. 2019. Aesthetic Attributes Assessment of Images. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Multimedia (MM ’19), October 21–25, 2019, Nice, France. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3343031.3350970

2. For the **PCCD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Kuang-Yu Chang, Kung-Hung Lu, and Chu-Song Chen. 2017. Aesthetic Critiques Generation for Photos. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, ICCV 2017, Venice, Italy, October 22-29, 2017. IEEE Computer Society, 3534–3543. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.2017.380

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **DPC-Captions**: A large-scale dataset containing 154,384 images and 2,427,483 comments, designed for aesthetic attributes assessment.
- **PCCD**: A smaller dataset with 4,235 images and 29,645 comments, used for aesthetic critique generation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its citation, ready for further processing or review.
