To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combinatorial Music Generation Model with Song Structure Graph Analysis" by Seonghyeon Go and Kyogu Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and implementation details** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction discusses various models and concepts but does not explicitly mention datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **Lakh Pianoroll Dataset (LPD-17)**, which is a subset of the Lakh MIDI dataset. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its composition of multitrack music for 17 instruments and the genres included.

The authors state that they collected 4240 pieces of music with genre information, which is also relevant for dataset extraction. I will note down the specifics of this dataset, including the number of pieces, the types of instruments, and the genres covered.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For the **Lakh Pianoroll Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C Raffel, "Learning-based methods for comparing sequences, with applications to audio-to-midi alignment and matching." Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
