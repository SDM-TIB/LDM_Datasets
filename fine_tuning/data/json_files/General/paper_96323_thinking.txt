To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamics of Feed Forward Induced Interference Training" by Shirui Tang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions an experiment conducted on a **4-class classification problem extracted from MNIST**, which indicates that the MNIST dataset is used.

Next, I will examine the **method section**, specifically where the author discusses the MNIST dataset. The author provides several reasons for choosing MNIST, including its structure being naturally 2D and the uniformity of character orientations. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed the primary dataset used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the author describes how the MNIST dataset was utilized for few-shot classification tasks, further solidifying its role in the research. The author also mentions that the test was evaluated on the MNIST test set using the digits [0, 1, 2, 4].

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the correct citation as it is crucial for proper documentation.

The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the method section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Confirming the dataset's role in the experiments section.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset based on the information collected.
