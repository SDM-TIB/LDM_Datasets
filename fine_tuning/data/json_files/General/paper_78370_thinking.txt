To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coordinating Filters for Faster Deep Neural Networks" by Wei Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any references to datasets. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) and mention various techniques but do not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a subsection dedicated to datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet** for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets used to evaluate the proposed method.

Now, I will gather detailed information about these datasets, including their descriptions and full citations from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

   Citation:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories. It is widely used in the computer vision community for benchmarking algorithms.

   Citation:
   > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

After collecting this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will allow me to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I will extract the datasets by:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and experiments sections.
2. Identifying the datasets mentioned (CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet).
3. Retrieving full citations for each dataset from the references.
4. Compiling the information into a structured format for review or processing.
