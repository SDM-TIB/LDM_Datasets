To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaskSplit: Self-supervised Meta-learning for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation" by Mustafa Sercan Amac et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on few-shot segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two standard few-shot semantic segmentation datasets:

1. **PASCAL-5i**: This dataset is based on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and includes 20 classes divided into four folds. The authors mention that it is used for training and evaluation in their experiments.

2. **COCO-20i**: This dataset is derived from the COCO dataset and consists of 80 classes divided into four folds. The authors also state that they used this dataset for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. Eslami, L. Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111:98–136, 2014.

- For **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
