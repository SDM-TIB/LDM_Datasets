To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto-Keras: An Efficient Neural Architecture Search System" by Haifeng Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting "intensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three benchmark datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **FASHION-MNIST**. I will take note of these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **FASHION-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv:cs.LG/cs.LG/1708.07747, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
