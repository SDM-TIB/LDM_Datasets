To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A t-distribution based operator for enhancing out of distribution robustness of neural network classifiers" by Niccolò Antonello and Philip N. Garner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of neural networks to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of OOD datasets but do not provide specific names. I will continue to the **evaluation section** where they describe experiments conducted on specific datasets.

In **section IV (Evaluation)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST)**: This dataset consists of images of clothing items and is intended as a more challenging replacement for the MNIST dataset. The authors reference it as a benchmark for their image classification tasks.

2. **Kuzushiji-MNIST (KMNIST)**: This dataset contains images of cursive Japanese Hiragana characters and is also used as a challenging alternative to the MNIST dataset.

Additionally, they mention using **CIFAR10** as an OOD dataset, which consists of colored images of objects belonging to 10 different classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf, “Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **Kuzushiji-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > T. Clanuwat, M. Bober-Irizar, A. Kitamoto, A. Lamb, K. Yamamoto, and D. Ha, “Deep learning for classical Japanese literature,” arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
