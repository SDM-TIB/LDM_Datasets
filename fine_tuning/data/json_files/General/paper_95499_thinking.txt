To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brain tumor segmentation with self-ensembled, deeply-supervised 3D U-net neural networks: a BraTS 2020 challenge solution" by ThÃ©o Henry et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their models on the **Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2020 training dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction**. The authors mention the BraTS challenge and its tasks, which reinforces the importance of the dataset for their experiments.

In the **methods section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss the datasets used. The authors describe their training process and mention that they utilized the **BraTS 2020 training dataset** for training their models. They also refer to the **online validation dataset** and the **final test dataset**, which are likely derived from the same challenge.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the BraTS 2020 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **BraTS 2020 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., et al. "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(10), 1993-2024, 2015. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and characteristics, and ensure that I include the full citation for the BraTS 2020 dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
