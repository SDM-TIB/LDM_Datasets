To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models" by Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of OMGEval, which is a multilingual generative evaluation benchmark. It indicates that the dataset includes 804 open-ended questions across five languages (Chinese, Russian, French, Spanish, and Arabic). This suggests that OMGEval itself is a dataset, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the construction of the OMGEval dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of 805 entries, which are aligned across all languages and include localized questions. This section provides crucial details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors evaluate several multilingual LLMs using the OMGEval dataset. They discuss the performance of different models on this dataset, which reinforces that OMGEval is indeed the primary dataset being utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OMGEval dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, I will cite it as follows:

- For the OMGEval dataset, the citation is:
  > Yang Liu, Meng Xu, Shuo Wang, Liner Yang, Haoyu Wang, Zhenghao Liu, Cunliang Kong, Yun Chen, Maosong Sun, Erhong Yang. *OMGEval: An Open Multilingual Generative Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX, 2023. (Note: Replace "XXXX.XXXX" with the actual arXiv identifier if available.)

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the specified structure. The OMGEval dataset is significant as it aims to assess the capabilities of LLMs in various languages, reflecting cultural diversity and enhancing the evaluation of multilingual models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
