To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SRM: A Style-based Recalibration Module for Convolutional Neural Networks" by HyunJae Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed Style-based Recalibration Module (SRM) in various vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Object Classification)**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet-1K dataset** and the **CIFAR-10/100 datasets** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

1. **ImageNet-1K Dataset**: The paper states that this dataset consists of 1,000 classes with 1.3 million training and 50,000 validation images. This dataset is widely recognized in the field of computer vision.

2. **CIFAR-10/100 Datasets**: The authors mention that CIFAR-10 consists of 50,000 training and 10,000 test images, while CIFAR-100 has a similar structure but with 100 classes instead of 10.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. In IJCV, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-10/100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
