To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long Tail Image Generation Through Feature Space Augmentation and Iterated Learning" by Rafael Elberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges in data availability, particularly in the medical domain, and hints at the use of a specific dataset for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the need for balanced training data and mentions the MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset, which is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **results sections**. In the results section, the authors explicitly mention that their method was tested using a sampled version of the **MIMIC-CXR-LT 2023** dataset, which is a multilabel multiclass long-tailed dataset of chest X-rays. This is a key dataset for the study.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-CXR-LT dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Gregory Holste, Song Wang, Ajay Jaiswal, Yuzhe Yang, Mingquan Lin, Yifan Peng, and Atlas Wang. *CXR-LT: Multi-Label Long-Tailed Classification on Chest X-Rays (version 1.1.0)*, 2023.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to document it thoroughly.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for clear identification and reference in any subsequent analysis or processing.
