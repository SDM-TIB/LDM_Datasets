To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Teaching Small Language Models to Reason" by Lucie Charlotte Magister et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors improve task performance across various reasoning datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are used. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly the **subsections 4.1.1 (Arithmetic Reasoning)**, **4.1.2 (Commonsense Reasoning)**, and **4.1.3 (Symbolic Reasoning)**. Here, the authors detail the datasets used for benchmarking their method. 

In **subsection 4.1.1**, the following datasets are mentioned:
1. **GSM8K**: A dataset for math word problems, referenced with the citation:
   > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, Christopher Hesse, and John Schulman. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168, 2021.

2. **MAWPS**: Another math word problem dataset, with the citation:
   > Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Subhro Roy, Aida Amini, Nate Kushman, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. *MAWPS: A math word problem repository*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 1152–1157, 2016.

3. **ASDiv**: A dataset for arithmetic word problems, cited as:
   > Shen-Yun Miao, Chao-Chun Liang, and Keh-Yih Su. *A diverse corpus for evaluating and developing English math word problem solvers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.15772, 2021.

In **subsection 4.1.2**, the authors mention:
4. **StrategyQA**: A commonsense reasoning dataset, with the citation:
   > Mor Geva, Daniel Khashabi, Elad Segal, Tushar Khot, Dan Roth, and Jonathan Berant. *Did Aristotle use a laptop? A question answering benchmark with implicit reasoning strategies*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:346–361, 2021.

In **subsection 4.1.3**, the authors refer to two synthetic tasks for symbolic reasoning:
5. **Last Letter Concatenation** and **Coinflip**: These tasks are generated as described in Wei et al. (2022), which I will need to cite as well:
   > Jason Wei, Xuezhi Wang, Dale Schuurmans, Maarten Bosma, Ed Chi, Quoc Le, and Denny Zhou. *Chain of thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.11903, 2022.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** for the complete citations to confirm their accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
