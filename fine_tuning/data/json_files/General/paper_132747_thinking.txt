To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-aware Transformer for Financial Time series Forecasting" by Hajar Emami et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of time series forecasting in the financial sector and hints at the use of external data sources, which suggests that datasets will be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two main sources of data:

1. **U.S. Interest Rates (IR) Data**: This dataset includes interest rates across various maturities (2 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years) collected from the Federal Reserve's website, spanning from 1999 to 2022.

2. **FRED Time Series Data**: This dataset consists of various economic indicators such as unemployment rates, retail sales, housing prices, and oil prices, also collected from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website during the same time period.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of **text reports** from the Federal Reserve, specifically FOMC statements and Beige Books, which are crucial for their multimodal approach.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **U.S. Interest Rates Data**, the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve. *U.S. Interest Rates Data*. Retrieved from https://www.federalreserve.gov/

- For the **FRED Time Series Data**, the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). *FRED Time Series Data*. Retrieved from https://fred.stlouisfed.org/

- For the **text reports** (FOMC statements and Beige Books), the citation is:
  > Federal Reserve. *FOMC Statements and Beige Books*. Retrieved from https://www.federalreserve.gov/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
