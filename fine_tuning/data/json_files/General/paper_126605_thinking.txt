To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Models from Quantum Computer Benchmarks" by Daniel Hothem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of a framework for building predictive models from benchmarking data, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Predictive models from benchmarks)**, where the authors describe the benchmarks and capability functions. Here, they mention various benchmarking methods, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their case studies.

In **section III (Case study 1: Error rate models)**, the authors discuss fitting error rates models (ERMs) to benchmarking data. They mention using data from **ibmq kolkata** for their analysis, which indicates that this is a dataset of interest. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of circuits and the specific metrics used.

Moving to **section IV (Case study 2: Transfer learning with ResNet50)**, the authors describe using simulated data from a publicly-accessible repository for their capability model. They mention that the data consists of success probabilities for randomized mirror circuits (RMCs) for a 5-qubit processor, which is another dataset I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. For the **ibmq kolkata** dataset, the citation is:
   > IBM Quantum. *ibmq kolkata*. [Online]. Available: https://quantum-computing.ibm.com, 2021.

2. For the **simulated data** used in the second case study, the citation is:
   > D. Hothem, T. Catanach, K. Young, and T. Proctor. *Simulated data for quantum circuit success probabilities*. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7829489, accessed: 2023-04-12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective references as required.
