To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision Encoder-Decoder Models for AI Coaching" by Dr. Jyothi S Nayak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the integration of vision-encoder-decoder models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction highlights the importance of visual context in coaching scenarios, which suggests that datasets related to visual inputs may be involved.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Training Dataset Generation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the model. Here, the authors describe the creation of a comprehensive dataset for Tic-Tac-Toe, which includes all possible board configurations and corresponding conversations. This dataset is crucial for training the model to perform specific tasks related to the game.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: This dataset consists of 59,049 samples, each comprising a PIL-generated image of a Tic-Tac-Toe board and a corresponding text conversation for tasks such as determining board validity, predicting the winner, and suggesting the best move.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves and does not reference an external source, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created specifically for this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset generated by the authors, consisting of 59,049 samples of Tic-Tac-Toe board images and corresponding conversations.

Since there is no external citation for the dataset, I will document it as an original dataset created for the purposes of this research.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
