To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Machine Learning to Calibrate Storm-Scale Probabilistic Guidance of Severe Weather Hazards in the Warn-on-Forecast System" by Montgomery L. Flora et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **WoF System (WoFS) ensemble forecasts** from the 2017-2019 NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiments, which suggests that this is a primary dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in **section 2 (Description of the Forecast Data)**. Here, the authors describe the WoFS as an experimental multi-physics ensemble capable of producing severe weather guidance. They mention that the ensemble comprises **36 members at a 3-km horizontal grid spacing**, and that the data were collected over **81 cases** during the 2017-2019 experiments. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3 (Data Pre-Processing Procedures)**, the authors detail how they processed the WoFS data, including the identification of ensemble storm tracks and the extraction of predictors. This reinforces that the WoFS dataset is central to their analysis.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the WoFS dataset, as it is part of the NOAA's operational data. However, I can reference the original papers that describe the WoFS system and its development.

The relevant citations for the WoFS dataset are:

1. **NOAA Warn-on-Forecast System**:
   > Stensrud, D. J., et al. (2009). "Convective-scale warn-on-forecast system." *Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society*, 90(10), 1487-1500. doi:10.1175/2009BAMS2795.1.

2. **Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiments**:
   > Gallo, B. T., et al. (2017). "Breaking new ground in severe weather prediction: The 2015 NOAA/Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiment." *Weather and Forecasting*, 32(4), 1541-1568. doi:10.1175/WAF-D-16-0178.1.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required.
