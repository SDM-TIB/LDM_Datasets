To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IPatch: A Remote Adversarial Patch" by Yisroel Mirsky, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **CamVid street view dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe their evaluation process and mention using the **CamVid dataset** for training their segmentation models and evaluating their adversarial patches. They provide details about the dataset, including its size and the nature of the annotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also mention using the **BDD100k dataset** for training their patches, which is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CamVid Dataset**: The citation is:
   > G. J. Brostow, J. Fauqueur, and R. Cipolla. "Semantic object classes in video: A high-definition ground truth database." *Pattern Recognition Letters*, vol. 30, no. 2, pp. 88–97, 2009.

2. **BDD100k Dataset**: The citation is:
   > F. Yu, H. Chen, X. Wang, W. Xian, Y. Chen, F. Liu, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. "BDD100k: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning." In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*, 2020, pp. 2636–2645.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
