To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic PET cardiac and parametric image reconstruction: a fixed-point proximity gradient approach using patch-based DCT and tensor SVD regularization" by Ida Häggström et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aims and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of dynamic PET imaging and the challenges faced in accurately measuring left ventricular function. They mention the use of simulations and phantoms, which suggests that datasets may be derived from these simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors describe the simulations conducted. They mention two specific phantoms used for their experiments:

1. **Cardiac/Lung Phantom**: This phantom was constructed from two CT scans, one stationary lung phantom and one dynamic cardiac CT scan. The authors detail how the phantom was created and the parameters used for the simulation.

2. **Brain Phantom**: This phantom is based on a BrainWeb brain phantom with inserted lesions. The authors provide details about the kinetic parameters assigned to different regions of the phantom.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to the performance of their reconstruction methods on these phantoms, which further confirms their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Cardiac/Lung Phantom**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Imaging Archive. [Online]. Available: http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net

- For the **Brain Phantom**, the citation is:
  > Collins, D. L., Zijdenbos, A. P., Kollokian, V., Sled, J. G., Kabani, N. J., Holmes, C. J., & Evans, A. C. (1998). Design and Construction of a Realistic Digital Brain Phantom. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 17(3), 463-468.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
