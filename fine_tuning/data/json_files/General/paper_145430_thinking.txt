To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Research on Dangerous Flight Weather Prediction based on Machine Learning" by Haoxing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodologies, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of historical meteorological observations, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various meteorological factors affecting flight safety but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodologies** section, where they describe the support vector machine (SVM) model and its parameters, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they utilize the dataset from **The NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center (SPC)**. This is a significant dataset for their research, as it provides comprehensive data on severe weather events, which is crucial for their analysis.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the SPC dataset. However, the SPC dataset is a well-known resource and may not have a specific citation in the references. Instead, I will note that it is commonly referenced in meteorological research.

Since the SPC dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center (SPC) Dataset**: This dataset includes comprehensive records of severe weather events such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, and wind storms, which are essential for forecasting and analyzing severe weather patterns.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I provide a clear description of the dataset along with its citation. Since the SPC dataset does not have a specific citation in the references, I will note its common usage in meteorological studies.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it is clear and informative for anyone who may need to reference it in future work.
