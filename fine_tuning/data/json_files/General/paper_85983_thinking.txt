To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classifying the Valence of Autobiographical Memories from fMRI Data" by Alex Frid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of fMRI data and machine learning techniques to classify autobiographical memories, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection titled **Experimental Data**. Here, the authors mention that they used the same dataset reported in a previous study by Nawa and Ando. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being referenced, which I need to identify.

In the **Methodology** section, the authors describe the experimental setup, including the tasks performed by participants during fMRI scanning. They mention that the dataset consists of scans from 11 participants, which provides some context but does not give a specific dataset name. I will need to refer to the cited work (Nawa and Ando) to find the dataset details.

I will then look at the **References section** to locate the full citation for the dataset used in the study by Nawa and Ando. The relevant citation is:

- Nawa, N. E., & Ando, H. (2014). *Classification of Self-Driven Mental Tasks from Whole-Brain Activity Patterns*. PLoS ONE, 9(5), e97296. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097296.

This citation indicates that the dataset used in the current study is derived from the work of Nawa and Ando, which is crucial for proper attribution.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Autobiographical Memory fMRI Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of fMRI scans from 11 participants who performed tasks involving the retrieval of positive and negative autobiographical memories. The data was collected during a series of scanning sessions where participants alternated between memory retrieval tasks and counting tasks.
   - **Citation**: Nawa, N. E., & Ando, H. (2014). *Classification of Self-Driven Mental Tasks from Whole-Brain Activity Patterns*. PLoS ONE, 9(5), e97296. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097296.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset details and citations as required.
