To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAMCLR: Contrastive pre-training on complex scenes using SAM for view sampling" by Benjamin Missaoui and Chongbin Yuan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention pre-training on **Cityscapes** and **ADE20K**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of using image classification datasets like ImageNet and highlight the importance of scene-centric datasets for their method. They specifically mention **Cityscapes** and **ADE20K** as datasets used for pre-training.

In the **experiments section**, I will find more detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. The authors state that they pre-trained their model on **Cityscapes**, which contains images from urban scenes, and on **ADE20K**, which includes a diverse set of everyday scenes. This confirms their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proc. of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

2. For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
   > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Tete Xiao, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20K dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(3):302â€“321, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
