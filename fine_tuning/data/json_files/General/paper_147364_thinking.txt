To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks" by Jesse Merhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss evaluating their method on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, particularly in **section IX (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Foursquare NYC (FS-NYC)**: This dataset consists of 3,079 trajectories with a maximum of 144 locations each, primarily within New York City’s bounds. The authors state that they used the dataset as provided in a previous work without further preprocessing.

2. **Geolife Dataset**: This dataset covers a larger geographical area around Beijing and contains 17,621 trajectories. The authors mention that they constrained the data within the fourth ring road of Beijing and capped trajectories at 144 locations, discarding those with fewer than 96 locations to prevent extensive padding.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Foursquare NYC dataset**, the citation is:
> Dingqi Yang, Daqing Zhang, V. W. Zheng, and Zhiyong Yu. *Modeling User Activity Preference by Leveraging User Spatial Temporal Characteristics in LBSNs*. IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, vol. 45, no. 1, pp. 129–142, Jan. 2015.

For the **Geolife dataset**, the citation is:
> Y. Zheng, L. Zhang, X. Xie, and W.-Y. Ma. *Mining interesting locations and travel sequences from GPS trajectories*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, ser. WWW ’09. New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery, Apr. 2009, pp. 791–800.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work or research.
