To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IUST_NLP at SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detecting Sexism with Transformers and Task-adaptive Pretraining" by Hadiseh Mahmoudi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a system for detecting and classifying sexist content, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the EDOS shared task and the need for models to detect sexism in content from platforms like Gab and Reddit. This hints at the presence of datasets from these sources.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the author provides details about the datasets used. Here, I find that the paper utilizes:

1. **Labeled Dataset**: A dataset containing 20,000 labeled instances of user-generated text content from Reddit and Gab.
2. **Unlabeled Dataset**: A larger dataset comprising 2 million instances of user-generated text from the same platforms, which is used for task-adaptive pretraining.

In **section 4.1 (Data)**, the author provides a summary of the dataset distribution across the three subtasks, which further confirms the datasets used for training, validation, and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the SemEval-2023 Task 10 paper by Kirk et al. (2023) as the source for the datasets used in the task. The citation is:

- For the SemEval-2023 Task 10 dataset:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
