To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Meta-Learning for Multi-Modal Task Distributions" by Cesar Almecija et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are critical to the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

In this paper, I expect to find datasets related to meta-learning tasks, possibly including synthetic datasets created for the experiments, as well as any standard datasets used for benchmarking the proposed method.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or presentation.
