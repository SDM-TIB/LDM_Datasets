To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A scalable multi-step least squares method for network identification with unknown disturbance topology" by Stefanie J.M. Fonken et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, such as "simulations were performed using the XYZ dataset" or "the results were validated on the ABC dataset."

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will examine it for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This section often discusses the performance of the methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for citations that provide the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset called "XYZ Dataset," I will find its citation, which might look like:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. Publisher/Journal.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
