To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Aware Wavelet-based Detection of Morphed Face Images" by Poorya Aghdaie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using three datasets: **VISAPP17, LMA, and MorGAN**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 4.1) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention that:

1. **VISAPP17**: This dataset is generated using landmark-based face morphing attacks, followed by splicing. The authors describe the morphing process, which involves averaging the locations of corresponding landmarks in two bona fide subjects and using Delaunay triangulation for blending.

2. **LMA**: This dataset is also a landmark-based morphed image dataset. The authors do not provide extensive details in this section, but it is categorized similarly to VISAPP17.

3. **MorGAN**: This dataset is generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The authors explain that GAN-based morphing attacks synthesize morphed images by capturing the underlying distributions of bona fide facial images, contrasting with the landmark-based approach.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **VISAPP17**, the citation is:
  > A. Makrushin, T. Neubert, and J. Dittmann. *Automatic generation and detection of visually faultless facial morphs*. In International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications, volume 7, pages 39–50. SCITEPRESS, 2017.

- For **LMA**, the citation is:
  > N. Damer, A. M. Saladie, A. Braun, and A. Kuijper. *Morgan: Recognition vulnerability and attack detectability of face morphing attacks created by generative adversarial network*. In 2018 IEEE 9th International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS), pages 1–10. IEEE, 2018.

- For **MorGAN**, the citation is the same as LMA since it is referenced in the same context.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
