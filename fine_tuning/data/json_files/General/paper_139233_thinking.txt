To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Stochastic AC-OPF using Gaussian Processes" by Mile Mitrovic, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In the abstract, the author discusses the development of a data-driven algorithm and mentions applications to multiple IEEE test cases, indicating that datasets related to these test cases are likely included.

Next, I will look into **section 2.4 (Synthetic dataset generation)**, which is explicitly dedicated to the generation of synthetic datasets. Here, the author describes how the synthetic dataset is created, detailing the components involved in the dataset generation process. The section outlines three parts of injection sampling: active power loads and renewable energy sources (RES), reactive power loads and RES, and active power generation. This indicates that there are multiple datasets generated for different aspects of the study.

In **section 4.4 (Experimental Setup and Results)**, the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments, specifically mentioning the IEEE 9, 39, and 118-bus test systems. Each of these systems has specific characteristics and configurations that are important for the analysis. The author provides details about the number of generators, loads, and the nature of the renewable sources included in each test case.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations will be derived from the references provided in the paper, particularly focusing on the IEEE test cases and any other relevant datasets mentioned.

2. **IEEE 39-bus Test System**: 
   > "IEEE 39-bus Test System." IEEE Power Systems Test Case Archive. Available at: [https://www.pserc.cornell.edu/](https://www.pserc.cornell.edu/)

3. **IEEE 118-bus Test System**: 
   > "IEEE 118-bus Test System." IEEE Power Systems Test Case Archive. Available at: [https://www.pserc.cornell.edu/](https://www.pserc.cornell.edu/)

Additionally, I will note the synthetic datasets generated in section 2.4, but since they are not standard datasets with formal citations, I will summarize their generation process instead.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
