To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Named Entity Recognition for Nepali Language" by Oyesh Mann Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset for Nepali NER, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Statistics)**, where the authors describe two datasets:

1. **OurNepali Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and contains sentences collected from daily newspapers in Nepal from 2015-2016. It includes three major classes: Person (PER), Location (LOC), and Organization (ORG). The dataset is in CoNLL-2003 IO format and is intended to support future research in Nepali NER.

2. **ILPRL Dataset**: This dataset was received from Bal Krishna Bal at ILPRL, Kathmandu University. It also follows the CoNLL-2003 IOB format and includes POS tags. The authors mention that some corrections were made to the NER tags in this dataset.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the OurNepali dataset is created by the authors and does not have a separate citation, I will note that it is available in their GitHub repository. The ILPRL dataset is referenced as being prepared by the ILPRL Lab and KEIV Technologies, but it does not have a specific citation either.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with the necessary details:

- For **OurNepali Dataset**, I will note that it is a novel dataset created by the authors for Nepali NER, available on their GitHub repository.

- For **ILPRL Dataset**, I will mention that it was prepared by the ILPRL Lab and KEIV Technologies, but again, it does not have a specific citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations as required, while also noting the availability of the datasets for future research.
