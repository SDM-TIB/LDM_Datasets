To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Convergence of DETR with Spatially Modulated Co-Attention" by Peng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors perform extensive ablation studies on the **COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for validation. They state that they validate their proposed SMCA over the **COCO 2017 dataset**, which contains 118k training images and 5k validation images. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides some context about its size.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be done in a structured manner, ready for downstream processing or review.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Confirm the dataset in the experiment setup section.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

With this information, I can now create the dataset entry for the COCO dataset.
