To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Relighting and Expression Transfer on Video Portraits" by Youjia Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or data collection.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the data acquisition process. In this paper, the authors discuss a **dynamic OLAT (One-Light-At-a-Time) dataset** that they built for capturing facial expressions and lighting conditions. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, so I will ensure to note its details.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may have been used for validation or comparison purposes. The authors may reference other datasets to benchmark their results against existing methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **Dynamic OLAT Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences captured under various lighting conditions and facial expressions. The authors describe the setup and the process of capturing this dataset in detail, emphasizing its importance for their neural rendering approach.

2. **Light Stage Dataset**: The authors reference the Light Stage technology used for capturing high-quality facial reflectance fields. While they do not provide a specific dataset name, they refer to the foundational work that established this method.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Dynamic OLAT Dataset**, since it is a novel dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Wang, Y., Zhou, T., Li, M., Xu, T., Xu, L., & Yu, J. (2023). Neural Relighting and Expression Transfer on Video Portraits. *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

- For the **Light Stage Dataset**, I will reference the original work that introduced the Light Stage technology:
  > Debevec, P. E., & Malik, J. (2000). Acquiring the Reflectance Field of a Human Face. In *Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques* (pp. 145-156).

With these citations, I will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference and use in related research. Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format for clarity and ease of access.
