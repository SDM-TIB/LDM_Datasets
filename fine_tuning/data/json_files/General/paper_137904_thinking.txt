To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Distributional Uncertainty of the SHAP score in Explainable Machine Learning" by Santiago Cifuentes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **California Housing dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about this dataset, including its size and features.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the California Housing dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly. The reference provided in the paper is:
> Nugent, C. (2018). *California Housing Prices*. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a brief description, and the citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
