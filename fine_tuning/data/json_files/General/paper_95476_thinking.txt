To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Over-Parameterized Neural Networks as Under-Determined Linear Systems" by Austin R. Benson, Anil Damle, and Alex Townsend, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on neural networks and their training dynamics, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the theoretical aspects of neural networks but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into **section 2 (An over-parameterized two-layer neural network)**, where the authors describe the model and the data points used. Here, I find a specific dataset mentioned in **Definition 2.1**:

1. **Dataset XR**: This dataset consists of 8 distinct data points in a specific format. The points are defined as:
   - \( x_1 = (s, s, s, 0) \)
   - \( x_2 = (-s, s, s, 0) \)
   - \( x_3 = (s, -s, s, 0) \)
   - \( x_4 = (s, s, -s, 0) \)
   - \( x_5 = (-s, -s, s, 0) \)
   - \( x_6 = (-s, s, -s, 0) \)
   - \( x_7 = (s, -s, -s, 0) \)
   - \( x_8 = (-s, -s, -s, 0) \)
   where \( s = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for any datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset XR is a constructed dataset specific to this paper, it may not have an external citation. The authors do not provide a reference for this dataset, as it is defined within the context of their theoretical analysis.

After confirming the dataset details, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset XR**: A set of 8 distinct data points defined in the paper, used to demonstrate the limitations of the ReLU activation function in achieving zero training loss.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is unique to this study and does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
