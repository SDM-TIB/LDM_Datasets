To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEXTWORLDEXPRESS: Simulating Text Games at One Million Steps Per Second" by Peter Jansen and Marc-Alexandre Côté, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that TEXTWORLDEXPRESS includes implementations of three common text game benchmarks, which suggests that these benchmarks are the datasets I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **Environments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the specific environments implemented in TEXTWORLDEXPRESS. Here, they mention three benchmark environments:

1. **CookingWorld**: This environment tasks agents with preparing meals by following recipes. It is based on the work by Côté et al. (2018), which indicates that it is a dataset used for evaluating agents in cooking tasks.

2. **TextWorld Commonsense (TWC)**: This environment evaluates agents on common sense knowledge and is based on the work by Murugesan et al. (2021a). This suggests that it is another dataset used for assessing agents' reasoning capabilities.

3. **Coin Collector**: This benchmark is based on the work by Yuan et al. (2018) and focuses on object search and navigation tasks. This indicates that it is a dataset for evaluating agents in exploration tasks.

I will then confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset:

- For **CookingWorld**, the citation is:
  > Marc-Alexandre Côté, Ákos Kádár, Xingdi Yuan, Ben A. Kybartas, Tavian Barnes, Emery Fine, James Moore, Matthew J. Hausknecht, Layla El Asri, Mahmoud Adada, Wendy Tay, and Adam Trischler. *Textworld: A learning environment for text-based games*. In CGW@IJCAI, 2018.

- For **TextWorld Commonsense**, the citation is:
  > Keerthiram Murugesan, Mattia Atzeni, Pavan Kapani­pathi, Pushkar Shukla, Sadhana Kumaravel, Gerald Tesauro, Kartik Talamadupula, Mrinmaya Sachan, and Murray Campbell. *Text-based RL agents with commonsense knowledge: New challenges, environments and baselines*. In AAAI, 2021.

- For **Coin Collector**, the citation is:
  > Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Alessandro Sordoni, Romain Laroche, Rémi Tachet des Combes, Matthew J. Hausknecht, and Adam Trischler. *Counting to explore and generalize in text-based games*. ArXiv, abs/1806.11525, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly described along with its full citation to ensure proper attribution.
