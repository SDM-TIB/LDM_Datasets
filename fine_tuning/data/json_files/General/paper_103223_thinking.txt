To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shatter: An Efficient Transformer Encoder with Single-Headed Self-Attention and Relative Sequence Partitioning" by Ran Tian, Joshua Maynez, and Ankur P. Parikh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but the introduction and experiments sections are likely to contain more detailed information about the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the efficiency of their model and mention that they conduct extensive experiments across several datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of nine natural language understanding tasks, which serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating model performance in NLP.

2. **SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)**: A dataset for reading comprehension, consisting of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles.

3. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no questions, which explores the difficulty of natural yes/no questions.

4. **MultiRC**: A dataset for reading comprehension that requires answering multiple questions based on a passage.

The authors provide performance results on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GLUE Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Yada Pruksachatkun, Nikita Nangia, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461, 2018.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

- For **BoolQ**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, Ming-Wei Chang, Tom Kwiatkowski, Michael Collins, and Kristina Toutanova. *BoolQ: Exploring the Surprising Difficulty of Natural Yes/No Questions*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10044, 2019.

- For **MultiRC**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Khashabi, Snigdha Chaturvedi, Michael Roth, Shyam Upadhyay, and Dan Roth. *Looking Beyond the Surface: A Challenge Set for Reading Comprehension over Multiple Sentences*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 252â€“262, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented in the final output.
