To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Aggregation Network for Building Extraction from High-resolution Remote Sensing Images" by Xuan Zhou and Xuefeng Wei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the **experiments section** is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WHU Building Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 220,000 buildings from aerial images, partitioned into 8189 images of 512 x 512 pixels, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Massachusetts Building Dataset**: This dataset includes 151 aerial images from the Boston area, which were cropped into 512 x 512 pixels, resulting in a total of 3076 training images, 100 validation images, and 250 test images.

3. **Inria Aerial Building Dataset**: This dataset covers an area of 810 kmÂ² across five cities, with 8271 training images and 1600 test images after removing those without buildings.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **WHU Building Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ji, S., Wei, S., Lu, M. (2019). Fully Convolutional Networks for Multisource Building Extraction From an Open Aerial and Satellite Imagery Data Set. *IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing*, 57(1), 574-586.

- For the **Massachusetts Building Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mnih, V. (2013). Machine learning for aerial image labeling. *University of Toronto*.

- For the **Inria Aerial Building Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maggiori, E., Tarabalka, Y., Charpiat, G., et al. (2017). Can semantic labeling methods generalize to any city? The Inria aerial image labeling benchmark. In *2017 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)*, 3226-3229.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
