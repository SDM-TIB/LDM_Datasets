To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SaVeR: Optimal Data Collection Strategy for Safe Policy Evaluation in Tabular MDP" by Subhojyoti Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their work or that they compare their results against. This section often highlights the significance of the datasets in the context of the research.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments sections** in detail. These sections typically contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or provide additional context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets may include:

1. **Synthetic datasets** generated for the experiments, which may not have a formal citation but will be described in detail in the methodology.
2. **Benchmark datasets** commonly used in reinforcement learning or policy evaluation, which will have formal citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and attributed.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's relevance to the research, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
