To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MedAug: Contrastive learning leveraging patient metadata improves representations for chest X-ray interpretation" by Yen Nhi Truong Vu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **CheXpert dataset**, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is central to their research. The introduction further elaborates on the use of this dataset for pretraining and fine-tuning tasks.

Next, I will look into the **Cohort** section, where the authors provide detailed information about the **CheXpert dataset**. They describe it as a large collection of de-identified chest X-ray images, consisting of 224,316 images from 65,240 patients, labeled for the presence or absence of 14 radiological observations. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CheXpert dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, et al. *CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 33, pages 590â€“597, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **CheXpert dataset**, I will ensure that I include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the dataset information from the research paper.
