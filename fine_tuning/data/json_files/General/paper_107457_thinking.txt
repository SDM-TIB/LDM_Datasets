To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Optimization for Reinforcement Learning Tasks Using Sparse Computations" by Dmitry Ivanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses optimizing neural networks for reinforcement learning tasks but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the methods and results sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they tested their method on various reinforcement learning tasks, but they do not specify the datasets used. This indicates that I should look for specific environments or datasets in the methods section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the experiments. The authors mention experimenting with environments such as **Breakout**, **SpaceInvaders**, **Robotank**, **Enduro**, and **Freeway**. These are classic reinforcement learning environments, often associated with the **Atari 2600** games.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these environments but do not explicitly mention any datasets. However, since these environments are standard benchmarks in reinforcement learning, I can infer that they are using the **Atari Learning Environment** (ALE) as the dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Atari Learning Environment, but I can reference the original paper that introduced it:

- For the **Atari Learning Environment**, the citation is:
  > Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Munos, R. (2013). *The Arcade Learning Environment: An Evaluation Platform for General Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.6210.

Since the authors did not specify any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Atari Learning Environment.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Atari Learning Environment, ready for any further processing or review.
