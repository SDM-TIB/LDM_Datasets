To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identifying Best Practice Melting Patterns in Induction Furnaces: A Data-Driven Approach Using Time Series K-Means Clustering and Multi-Criteria Decision Making" by Howard, Jørgensen, and Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to identifying melting patterns. Here, they mention using time-series data collected from induction furnaces, which suggests that the dataset consists of operational data from these furnaces.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the data collected from a Danish foundry. They specify that data was obtained for one of the induction furnaces over a specific period (from May 11, 2022, to May 30, 2022). This indicates that the dataset is time-series data related to the melting process in the foundry.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the parameters collected (e.g., melt temperature, melt weight, furnace voltage, etc.), which are mentioned in the results section. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and content.

Next, I will check the **case study section**, where the authors describe the context in which the data was collected. They mention that the foundry is the largest in Northern Europe and has committed to sustainability, which adds context to the dataset's relevance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset appears to be original data collected by the authors from a specific foundry, there may not be external citations for the dataset itself.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the details of the dataset, including its name, description, and any relevant citations. The full citation for the paper itself will also be included to ensure proper attribution.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details and prepare them for structured output.
