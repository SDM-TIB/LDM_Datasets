To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OSSO: Obtaining Skeletal Shape from Outside" by Marilyn Keller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **1000 male and 1000 female dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans** for their study, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **Data section (Section 3)**, the authors describe the creation of a unique dataset that contains paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes derived from DXA images. This section is crucial as it outlines the dataset's characteristics and its significance in the study.

The authors mention that the dataset is made available as a **Biobank Returned Dataset** and that it was created using **1200 male and 1200 female DXA images from the UK Biobank**. This indicates that the UK Biobank dataset is another important dataset referenced in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The UK Biobank is cited as follows:
- UK Biobank:

(2015). UK Biobank: an open access resource for identifying the causes of a wide range of complex diseases of middle and old age. *PLOS Medicine*, 12(3), e1001779.

Next, I will summarize the datasets I have identified:

1. **OSSO Dataset**: This dataset consists of paired outer surface (skin) and skeleton (bone) meshes created from DXA images. It is a unique dataset specifically designed for the study and is available as a Biobank Returned Dataset.

2. **UK Biobank Dataset**: This dataset includes **1200 male and 1200 female DXA images** used for training and evaluation in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
