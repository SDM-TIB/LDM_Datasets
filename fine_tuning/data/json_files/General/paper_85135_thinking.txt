To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Agglomerative Attention" by Matthew Spellings, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any references to datasets used in the experiments. The introduction discusses the importance of attention mechanisms in neural networks but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **methods section**, where the author may describe the experimental setup and the datasets utilized.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets. The author discusses the agglomerative attention mechanism and its application to language modeling tasks. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might detail the datasets used for these tasks.

Upon reaching the **results section**, I find that the author evaluates the performance of the agglomerative attention model on two specific datasets: **text8** and **WikiText-2**. The descriptions provided are as follows:

1. **text8**: This dataset consists of the first 108 characters of a Wikipedia article dump from 2006, after removing punctuation and markup and converting to lowercase. This dataset is used for character-level language modeling tasks.

2. **WikiText-2**: This dataset contains words from 720 Wikipedia articles, with an average length of over 3500 words per article and a total vocabulary of over 33,000 words. It is used for word-level language modeling tasks.

Next, I will consult the **references section** to obtain the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **text8**, the citation is:
  > Mahoney, M. (2006). About the Test Data. Retrieved from https://cs.fit.edu/~mmahoney/compression/textdata.html.

- For **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models. arXiv:1609.07843. Retrieved from http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
