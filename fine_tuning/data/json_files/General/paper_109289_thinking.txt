To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smoothing Matters: Momentum Transformer for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation" by Runfa Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on "sim2real benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset is used as the target domain for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. It contains 2975 real images in the training set, with a resolution of 2048 × 1024 pixels.

2. **GTA5 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 24,966 simulation images, with a resolution of 1914 × 1052 pixels. It serves as the source domain for the experiments.

3. **SYNTHIA Dataset**: This dataset includes 9,400 simulation images, with a resolution of 1280 × 760 pixels. It is also used as a source domain for the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*.

- For the **GTA5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stephan R Richter, Vibhav Vineet, Stefan Roth, and Vladlen Koltun. *Playing for Data: Ground Truth from Computer Games*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 102–118, 2016.

- For the **SYNTHIA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > German Ros, Laura Sellart, Joanna Materzynska, David Vazquez, and Antonio M Lopez. *The SYNTHIA Dataset: A Large Collection of Synthetic Images for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3234–3243, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
