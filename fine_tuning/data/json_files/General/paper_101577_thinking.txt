To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Attributions and Counterfactual Explanations Can Be Manipulated" by Dylan Slack et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate manipulations on real-world datasets, specifically mentioning **COMPAS** and **Communities & Crime**. This suggests that these datasets are central to their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4 and section 5) to gather more details about how these datasets were used. In section 4.3, the authors explicitly state that they run experiments on the **COMPAS dataset**, which is used to construct a biased classifier. They also mention the **Communities & Crime dataset** in section 5.3, where they evaluate the effectiveness of manipulated models across counterfactual explanations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

1. For the **COMPAS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine bias. ProPublica.

2. For the **Communities & Crime dataset**, the citation is:
   > Becker, K. (2016). Communities and Crime Dataset. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper attributions.
