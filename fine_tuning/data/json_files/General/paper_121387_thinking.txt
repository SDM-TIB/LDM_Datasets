To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-Agnostic Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations" by Jonathan Richard Schwarz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses various modalities and mentions strong results over a large set of diverse modalities, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In **Section 4.1**, the authors provide a table summarizing the performance of their method on various datasets. I will note down the datasets mentioned here, including:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, which includes images of celebrities along with corresponding attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Karras, T., Aila, T., Laine, S., & Lehtinen, J. (2018). Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

2. **ShapeNet**: A dataset of 3D shapes of 10 different object categories. The citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. (2015). ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012.

3. **ERA5**: A dataset consisting of temperature observations from 1979 to 2020. The citation is:
   > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Biavati, G., Horányi, A., Muñoz Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Rozum, I., et al. (2019). ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS).

4. **SRN Cars**: A dataset of car scenes. The citation is:
   > Sitzmann, V., Zollhöfer, M., & Wetzstein, G. (2019). Scene representation networks: Continuous 3D-structure-aware neural scene representations. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.

5. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 50,000 train and 10,000 test images with a resolution of 32 x 32. The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

6. **Kodak**: A dataset of 24 uncompressed PNG images. The citation is:
   > Agustsson, E., & Timofte, R. (2017). Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops.

7. **LibriSpeech**: A collection of read English speech recordings. The citation is:
   > Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing.

8. **UCF-101**: A video action dataset comprising 13,320 videos. The citation is:
   > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. U. (2012). UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their descriptions and citations accurately. I will also check the **References section** to confirm the citations and gather any additional details that may be relevant for each dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
