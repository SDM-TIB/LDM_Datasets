To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Monocular Motion Segmentation Using Optical Flow and Pseudo Depth Map: A Zero-Shot Approach" by Yuxiang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method is evaluated on the **DAVIS-Moving** and **YTVOS-Moving** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors provide details about the datasets. Here, they mention that both datasets are subsets of larger datasets: **DAVIS-17** and **YouTube-VOS**. The authors describe the characteristics of these datasets, emphasizing that they contain videos where all moving objects are labeled, which is crucial for their motion segmentation tasks.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **DAVIS-Moving dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Pont-Tuset, F. Perazzi, S. Caelles, P. Arbeláez, A. Sorkine-Hornung, and L. Van Gool. *The 2017 DAVIS Challenge on Video Object Segmentation*. Mar. 2018, arXiv:1704.00675 [cs]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00675.

2. For the **YTVOS-Moving dataset**, the citation is:
   > N. Xu, L. Yang, Y. Fan, J. Yang, D. Yue, Y. Liang, B. Price, S. Cohen, and T. Huang. *YouTube-VOS: Sequence-to-Sequence Video Object Segmentation*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2018, V. Ferrari, M. Hebert, C. Sminchisescu, and Y. Weiss, Eds. Cham: Springer International Publishing, 2018, vol. 11209, pp. 603–619. Available: https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-01228-1_36.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to compile a comprehensive dataset entry for further processing or review.
