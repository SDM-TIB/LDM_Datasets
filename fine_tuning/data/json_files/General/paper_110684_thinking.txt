To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Speaker Identification Using Depthwise Separable Convolutional Network with Channel Attention" by Yanxiong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used datasets from three public speech corpora: **Aishell-2**, **VoxCeleb1**, and **TORGO**. This is a good starting point for my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **Aishell-2**: This dataset includes 1000 hours of Mandarin speech recordings from 1991 speakers, recorded in a quiet environment using an iOS mobile phone at 16 kHz and 16 bit.

2. **VoxCeleb1**: This dataset contains over 100,000 speech recordings from 1251 speakers, totaling 352 hours of audio. The recordings were made in noisy environments.

3. **TORGO**: This is a smaller pathological speech corpus consisting of recordings from 7 normal speakers and 8 dysarthria patients. The authors note that it is challenging to collect utterances from patients, making this dataset smaller compared to the others.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **Aishell-2**, the citation is:
  > J. Du, X. Na, X. Liu, and H. Bu. *Aishell-2: Transforming Mandarin ASR research into industrial scale*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1808.10583, 2018.

- For **VoxCeleb1**, the citation is:
  > A. Nagrani, J.S. Chung, W. Xie, and A. Zisserman. *Voxceleb: Large-scale speaker verification in the wild*. Comput. Speech Lang., vol. 60, pp. 1-15, 2020.

- For **TORGO**, the citation is:
  > N.J. Neethu, and S. Umesh. *Improving acoustic models in TORGO dysarthric speech database*. IEEE TNSRE, vol. 26, no. 3, pp. 637-645, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
