To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Robustness of In-Context Learning with Noisy Labels" by Xinzhi Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of Transformers' robustness against noisy labels but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors reference various models and concepts related to in-context learning (ICL) but do not explicitly mention any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology** sections, particularly **section 2 (Preliminaries)**, I will look for any descriptions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention constructing a synthetic dataset for training a transformer model to learn linear regression functions. However, they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset, as it is synthetic.

In **section 3 (Comprehensive Evaluation of Noisy ICL Inference)**, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the construction of a dataset with 10,000 prompts, each containing 100 demonstrations. Again, this dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation.

In **section 4 (Influence of Training with Noisy Labels on Robustness)**, the authors continue to discuss their experimental setup but do not introduce any new datasets. They refer to the same synthetic dataset used previously.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any datasets that might have been cited indirectly. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and concepts related to noisy labels and in-context learning, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses synthetic datasets created for the experiments and does not reference any established datasets with full citations, I will note that there are no formal datasets extracted from this paper that require citation.

In summary, the paper does not provide any datasets with full citations, as the datasets discussed are synthetic and created for the purpose of the experiments. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to document in the required format.
