To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STCrowd: A Multimodal Dataset for Pedestrian Perception in Crowded Scenes" by Peishan Cong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the STCrowd dataset, highlighting its purpose and key characteristics, which indicates that this is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or mentions of other datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of pedestrian perception and references various existing datasets, but it primarily focuses on the STCrowd dataset as a solution to these challenges.

Moving on to the **dataset section (Section 3)**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the STCrowd dataset. This section provides comprehensive information about the dataset, including the number of pedestrian instances, the types of annotations provided (2D/3D), and the various tasks it supports. It confirms that STCrowd is the main dataset being introduced in this paper.

In the **related work section (Section 2)**, the authors mention several other datasets that have been used in pedestrian perception research. However, these are not datasets that the authors created or used in their experiments; they are simply referenced to provide context. I will note these datasets but focus on the STCrowd dataset for extraction.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if the authors used any other datasets for comparison or evaluation. The experiments primarily focus on the performance of the proposed methods on the STCrowd dataset, reinforcing its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to gather full citations for the STCrowd dataset and any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The citation for the STCrowd dataset is as follows:

- For **STCrowd**, the citation is:
  > Peishan Cong, Xinge Zhu, Feng Qiao, Yiming Ren, Xidong Peng, Yuenan Hou, Lan Xu, Ruigang Yang, Dinesh Manocha, Yuexin Ma. *STCrowd: A Multimodal Dataset for Pedestrian Perception in Crowded Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the STCrowd dataset as it is the primary focus of the paper. I will also note the other datasets mentioned for context but will not include them in the final output since they are not the main datasets used in the authors' experiments.
