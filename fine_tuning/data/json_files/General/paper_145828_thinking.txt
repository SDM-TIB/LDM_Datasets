To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEAM: A Stochastic Benchmark for Multi-Document Tasks" by Gili Lior et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that SEAM is a benchmark over a diverse set of multi-document datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets will be listed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (SEAM: A Benchmark for Multi-Document Tasks)**, where the authors describe the datasets included in SEAM. Here, they explicitly mention that SEAM consists of six different datasets covering various multi-document tasks. I will carefully note down the names and descriptions of each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **MultiNews**: A dataset for multi-document summarization consisting of news articles from various sources with human-written summaries.
2. **OpenAsp**: A dataset for multi-document open aspect-based summarization, focusing on specific aspects within a topic.
3. **FuseReviews**: A dataset for fusion-in-context summarization, where the task is to generate a coherent passage from highlighted spans in reviews.
4. **MuSiQue**: A dataset for multi-hop question answering based on Wikipedia texts, requiring integration of information from multiple documents.
5. **SciCo**: A cross-document coreference resolution dataset primarily consisting of scientific paper abstracts.
6. **ECB+**: Another cross-document coreference resolution dataset focused on news articles discussing similar topics.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be documented as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
