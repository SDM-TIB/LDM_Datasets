To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and robust high-dimensional sparse logistic regression via nonlinear primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithms" by Jérôme Darbon and Gabriel P. Langlois, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses logistic regression and variable selection but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or analyses. The introduction mentions the challenges of variable selection in big data but does not specify any datasets.

I will then check the **methodology section** for any details on datasets used for testing or validation. This section may provide insights into the datasets employed in the experiments. If the authors describe their experiments, they might mention specific datasets or sources of data.

After that, I will look into the **results section** to see if the authors report results based on specific datasets. They may refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their method to existing approaches.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will note their names and descriptions. If the datasets are not explicitly named in the sections I reviewed, I will check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that might indicate the datasets used.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or analyses.
