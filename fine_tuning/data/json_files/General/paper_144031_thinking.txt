To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?" by Minhak Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **MNIST-5k**, **CIFAR10-5k**, and **SST2-1k**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors describe the datasets in more detail:
1. **MNIST-5k**: This dataset consists of the first 5000 samples of the MNIST dataset, which is used for multi-class classification with 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR10-5k**: This dataset includes the first 5000 samples of the CIFAR10 dataset, also for multi-class classification with 10 classes.
3. **SST2-1k**: This dataset comprises the first 1000 samples of the SST2 dataset, which is used for binary classification.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.
  
- **CIFAR10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, 2009.
  
- **SST2 Dataset**: 
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631–1642, 2013.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes the dataset names, their descriptions, and the full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented.
