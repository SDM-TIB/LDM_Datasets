To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Subspace Clustering Based on the Kronecker Product" by Lei Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions "experimental results on two public datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 5, where they mention using the **CMU PIE database** and the **MNIST dataset** for their evaluations.

1. **CMU PIE Database**: This dataset is used for face clustering experiments. The authors describe it as containing 41,368 images of 68 people under various poses, illuminations, and expressions. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for handwritten digit clustering. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 6,000 images for training and 1,000 for testing for each digit. This dataset is widely used for benchmarking in machine learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CMU PIE Database**, the citation is:
  > Sim, T., Baker, S., & Bsat, M. (2001). *The CMU Pose, Illumination, and Expression (PIE) Database of Human Faces*. Tech. Rep. CMU-RI-TR-01-02, Pittsburgh, PA.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278â€“2324.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
