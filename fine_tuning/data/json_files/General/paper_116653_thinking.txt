To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction and Evaluation of a Self-Attention Model for Semantic Understanding of Sentence-Final Particles" by Shuhei Mandokoro et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides context about the study but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sentence-final particles in Japanese and the computational models used for their acquisition. However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their simulation experiment. They mention preparing **470 data chunks** for training and testing, which indicates that they have created a dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide a formal name for this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

I will also look for any references to existing datasets that may have been used or adapted in their study. The authors mention that they excluded unnatural speech from the dataset, but they do not specify a name for this dataset either.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model but do not provide additional details about the dataset used. They focus on the learning progression and accuracy of the model rather than the dataset specifics.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any established datasets or provide full citations for any datasets used, I will conclude that the primary dataset referenced is the one they created for their study, which consists of the 470 data chunks. However, without a formal name or citation, I cannot provide a complete entry for a dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily include works related to the methodologies and models used, but they do not list any datasets.

In summary, while I have identified that the authors created a dataset for their experiments, they did not provide a formal name or citation for it. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is an original creation by the authors without a specific citation.

Since there are no established datasets with full citations to extract, I will prepare a summary of the findings regarding the dataset creation process mentioned in the paper, but I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly named.
