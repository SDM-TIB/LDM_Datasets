To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Theory-of-Mind Performance in Large Language Models via Prompting" by Shima Rahimi Moghaddam and Christopher J. Honey, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks and the evaluation of various LLMs, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental design and the materials used. In this case, the authors mention using **ToM scenarios and Control scenarios** adapted from a previous study (Dodell-Feder et al., 2011). This indicates that there are specific datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **supplementary material**, the authors provide a detailed list of the **16 ToM scenarios** and **16 Photo scenarios** used in their experiments. I will extract the names and descriptions of these scenarios, as they serve as the datasets for the study.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ToM scenarios**: These scenarios are adapted from:
   > Dodell-Feder, D., Koster-Hale, J., Bedny, M., & Saxe, R. (2011). FMRI item analysis in a theory of mind task. *NeuroImage*, 55(2), 705–712. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.040

2. **Photo scenarios**: These scenarios are also adapted from the same source:
   > Dodell-Feder, D., Koster-Hale, J., Bedny, M., & Saxe, R. (2011). FMRI item analysis in a theory of mind task. *NeuroImage*, 55(2), 705–712. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.12.040

Since both the ToM and Photo scenarios are derived from the same study, I will note that the citation applies to both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
