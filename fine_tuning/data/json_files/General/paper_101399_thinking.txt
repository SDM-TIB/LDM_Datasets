To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persistent Excitation is Unnecessary for On-line Exponential Parameter Estimation: A New Algorithm that Overcomes this Obstacle" by M. Korotina et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments or results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "the LTI system dataset" or "the DREM dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is well-known, I may also look it up independently to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is very important for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
