To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full deep neural network training on a pruned weight budget" by Maximilian Golub, Guy Lemieux, and Mieszko Lis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their method on several datasets, including **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and any relevant citations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training various models. They specifically mention:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for image classification tasks. The authors reference the original source of the dataset.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > LeCun, Y. (1998). The MNIST database of handwritten digits. Technical report, NEC Research Institute.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Masterâ€™s thesis, University of Toronto.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211-252.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
