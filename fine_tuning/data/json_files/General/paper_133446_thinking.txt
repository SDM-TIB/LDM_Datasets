To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ViPE: Visualise Pretty-much Everything" by Hassan Shahmohammadi, Adhiraj Ghosh, and Hendrik P. A. Lensch, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset called **LyricCanvas**, which is a significant indicator that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the creation of the **LyricCanvas dataset**, which consists of approximately 10 million lines of lyrics paired with visual elaborations generated by GPT-3.5. This dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

I will also check the **experiments and evaluation sections** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference the **Emotion dataset** in the evaluation section, which consists of 20,000 samples from Twitter messages with corresponding emotion labels. This dataset is used to assess the performance of ViPE in generating visual elaborations from emotionally charged text.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LyricCanvas dataset**, the citation is:
   > The dataset is compiled from publicly available lyrics sourced from Genius, but no specific citation is provided for the dataset itself in the paper.

2. For the **Emotion dataset**, the citation is:
   > Elvis Saravia, Hsien-Chi Toby Liu, Yen-Hao Huang, Junlin Wu, and Yi-Shin Chen. *Carer: Contextualized affect representations for emotion recognition*. In Proceedings of the 2018 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 3687â€“3697.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
