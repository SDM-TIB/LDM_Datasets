To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Paraphrasing with Large Language Models" by Sam Witteveen and Martin Andrews, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.4 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for fine-tuning their model. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MSR Paraphrase Identification Dataset**: This dataset consists of just over 4,000 examples of original sentences paired with their paraphrased counterparts.

2. **News Dataset**: An original dataset containing 10,000 sentences sourced from online news articles, each paired with human-generated paraphrases.

3. **Paragraphs Dataset**: Another original dataset comprising paragraphs with corresponding paraphrased paragraphs, sourced from various entertainment, news, and food articles.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MSR Paraphrase Identification Dataset**, the citation is:
  > William B. Dolan, Chris Quirk, and Chris Brockett. *Unsupervised construction of large paraphrase corpora: Exploiting massively parallel news sources*. In COLING, 2004.

- The **News Dataset** and **Paragraphs Dataset** are original datasets created by the authors, so they do not have external citations. However, I will note that they are original datasets created for this research.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are accurately presented. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
