To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Handling missing data in Burundian sovereign bond market" by Irene Irakoze et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the challenges of missing data in the Burundian sovereign bond market and mentions the methodologies proposed to handle this issue. However, it does not explicitly name any datasets. The introduction provides context about the Burundian bond market but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the imputation methods used to handle missing data and mention that they utilized a dataset of financial transactions with complete maturities. However, they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. I will note that the dataset is derived from the Burundi Central Bank, which is important for citation purposes.

I will also look into the **results and discussion sections** to see if any additional datasets are referenced or if there are any specific datasets used for testing the imputation methods. The authors mention that they created a random subset of the data to introduce missing maturities, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily consist of literature related to methodologies and previous studies but do not include specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names or citations for datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Financial Transactions Dataset**: This dataset is used for testing the imputation methods and is derived from the Burundi Central Bank. However, no formal citation is provided in the paper.

Given the lack of specific dataset names and citations, I will document the findings as follows:

- Dataset Name: Financial Transactions Dataset
- Description: A dataset of financial transactions with complete maturities used to test various imputation methods for handling missing data in the Burundian sovereign bond market.
- Citation: Derived from the Burundi Central Bank (no formal citation provided).

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is clearly documented for future reference or processing.
