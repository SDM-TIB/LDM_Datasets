To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbalanced and Light Optimal Transport" by Milena Gazdieva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In the paper, the authors mention using the **FFHQ dataset** for their image-to-image translation experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the specific classes of images used (e.g., adult and young faces).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FFHQ dataset. The citation for the FFHQ dataset is:
> Karras, T., Laine, S., and Aila, T. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4401â€“4410, 2019.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as synthetic datasets used for testing the proposed solver. If the authors refer to any synthetic datasets, I will document those as well, including any relevant details and citations if provided.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
