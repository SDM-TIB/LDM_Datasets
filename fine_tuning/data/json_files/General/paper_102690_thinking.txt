To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IntenT5: Search Result Diversification using Causal Language Models" by Sean MacAvaney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method across six standard evaluation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention the **TREC Web Track (WT) datasets** from 2009 to 2014, which consist of multiple topics and subtopics. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of topics and any relevant statistics.

The authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets include:

1. **TREC Web Track 2009 (WT09)**: Contains 50 topics with an average of 2.1 terms per topic and 6,499 positive relevance judgments.
2. **TREC Web Track 2010 (WT10)**: Also contains 50 topics, with 2.1 terms per topic and 9,006 positive relevance judgments.
3. **TREC Web Track 2011 (WT11)**: Contains 50 topics with an average of 3.4 terms per topic and 8,378 positive relevance judgments.
4. **TREC Web Track 2012 (WT12)**: Contains 50 topics with 2.3 terms per topic and 9,368 positive relevance judgments.
5. **TREC Web Track 2013 (WT13)**: Contains 50 topics with 3.3 terms per topic and 9,121 positive relevance judgments.
6. **TREC Web Track 2014 (WT14)**: Contains 50 topics with 3.3 terms per topic and 10,629 positive relevance judgments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The TREC Web Track datasets are typically cited in the context of their respective years, and I will ensure to include the full citation format as per the guidelines.

The citations for the TREC datasets are generally as follows:
- For **TREC 2009 Web Track**:
  > Charles L. A. Clarke, Nick Craswell, and Ian Soboroff. *Overview of the TREC 2009 Web Track*. In TREC, 2009.

- For **TREC 2010 Web Track**:
  > Charles L. A. Clarke, Nick Craswell, Ian Soboroff, and Gordon V. Cormack. *Overview of the TREC 2010 Web Track*. In TREC, 2010.

- For **TREC 2011 Web Track**:
  > Charles L. A. Clarke, Nick Craswell, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2011 Web Track*. In TREC, 2011.

- For **TREC 2012 Web Track**:
  > Charles L. A. Clarke, Nick Craswell, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2012 Web Track*. In TREC, 2012.

- For **TREC 2013 Web Track**:
  > Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Paul Bennett, Fernando Diaz, Charles L. A. Clarke, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *TREC 2013 Web Track Overview*. In TREC, 2013.

- For **TREC 2014 Web Track**:
  > Kevyn Collins-Thompson, Craig Macdonald, Paul Bennett, Fernando Diaz, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *TREC 2014 Web Track Overview*. In TREC, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
