To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spiking Tucker Fusion Transformer for Audio-Visual Zero-Shot Learning" by Wenrui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on **three benchmark datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed used, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ActivityNet**: This dataset contains approximately 200 different activity classes and more than 20,000 videos, with an average duration of about 2 minutes per video.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset consists of over 13,000 videos collected from YouTube, with an average duration of around 7 seconds per video, covering a wide range of human actions.

3. **VGGSound**: This dataset includes more than 200 different classes and thousands of audio clips obtained from online sources.

In the **dataset statistics section**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, confirming their relevance and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **ActivityNet**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 961–970, 2015.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Andrej Karpathy, George Toderici, Sanketh Shetty, Thomas Leung, Rahul Sukthankar, and Li Fei-Fei. *Large-scale video classification with convolutional neural networks*. In 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1725–1732, 2014.

- For **VGGSound**, the citation is:
  > Shawn Hershey, Sourish Chaudhuri, Daniel P. W. Ellis, Jort F. Gemmeke, Aren Jansen, R. Channing Moore, Manoj Plakal, Devin Platt, Rif A. Saurous, Bryan Seybold, Malcolm Slaney, Ron J. Weiss, and Kevin Wilson. *CNN architectures for large-scale audio classification*. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 131–135, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
