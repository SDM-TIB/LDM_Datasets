To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active Example Selection for In-Context Learning" by Yiming Zhang, Shi Feng, and Chenhao Tan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated on," "we used," or "the following datasets were employed."

In the **experiments section**, particularly in subsection 2.1 (In-context Text Classification with Demonstration Examples), the authors provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **AGNews**: A dataset for topic classification with 4 classes and an average length of 37.8 words.
2. **Amazon**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes and an average length of 78.5 words.
3. **SST-2**: A sentiment classification dataset with 2 classes and an average length of 19.3 words.
4. **TREC**: A dataset for question type classification with 6 classes and an average length of 10.2 words.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **AGNews**: Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (Vol. 28). Curran Associates, Inc.

- **SST-2**: Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
