To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Knowledge from Graph Convolutional Networks" by Yiding Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two different datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Dataset**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks and consists of graphs derived from human tissues. The authors note that it contains 24 graphs corresponding to different human tissues, with specific details about the average number of nodes and classes.

2. **ModelNet40 Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for 3D object recognition tasks and contains point clouds from CAD models. The authors provide information about the number of classes and the nature of the data.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PPI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marinka Zitnik and Jure Leskovec. *Predicting multicellular function through multi-layer tissue networks*. Bioinformatics, 33(14):i190–i198, 2017.

- For the **ModelNet40 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912–1920, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
