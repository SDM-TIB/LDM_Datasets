To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Reliable and Stable are Explanations of XAI Methods?" by JosÃ© Ribeiro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **diabetes dataset** for experiments, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research. I will note this down as a primary dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention that the diabetes dataset is the only dataset used in their analyses. They provide details about the dataset, including its features and the number of instances. This section will help me gather specific information about the dataset's characteristics.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the diabetes dataset as follows:
- **Diabetes Dataset**: Specifically, they refer to the Pima Indian diabetes dataset, which contains 768 instances and 9 numeric features related to diabetes prediction.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the diabetes dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
- For the **diabetes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sigillito, V. *Pima Indian Diabetes Database*. OpenML. Available at: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&id=37&sort=runs&status=active (2023).

Since the diabetes dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the diabetes dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any further processing or review.
