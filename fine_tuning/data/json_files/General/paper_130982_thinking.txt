To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-seeded Clustering for Unsupervised Valence-Arousal Emotion Recognition from Physiological Signals" by Antoine Dubois et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **WESAD dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They describe the **Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD)** dataset, which includes physiological signals from 15 subjects experiencing different emotional states. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of subjects, the types of physiological signals collected (EDA, BVP, and ST), and the emotional states elicited during the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WESAD dataset. The authors cite the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the WESAD dataset is:
> P. Schmidt, A. Reiss, R. Duerichen, C. Marberger, and K. Van Laerhoven. *Introducing WESAD, a multimodal dataset for wearable stress and affect detection*. In Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction, pp. 400â€“408, 2018.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the dataset used in the research.
