The nine relation types are Cause-Effect, Component-Whole, Content-Container, Entity-Destination, Entity-Origin, Instrument-Agency, Member-Collection, Message-Topic, and Product-Producer. The dataset contains 10,717 sentences, with each containing two nominals e1 and e2, and the corresponding relation type in the sentence. The relation is directional, meaning that Component-Whole(e1, e2) is different from Component-Whole(e2, e1). The dataset has already been partitioned into 8,000 training instances and 2,717 test instances.",
