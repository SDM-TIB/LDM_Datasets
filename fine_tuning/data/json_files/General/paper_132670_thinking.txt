To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Improved Crop and Weed Detection with Diverse Data Ensemble Learning" by Muhammad Hamza Asad et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors propose two novel datasets for comparisons, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Kochia Weed Dataset (KWD-2023)**: This dataset consists of 99 images collected from fields infested with Kochia weed, which affects various crops. The images were taken under uncontrolled field conditions.

2. **Multi-Stage Canola Dataset (MSCD-2023)**: This dataset contains 305 images of Canola crops collected from multiple fields, representing two growth stages: early-stage dicots Canola and mid-stage broad leaves Canola.

In the **collection process**, the authors describe how high-resolution RGB images were collected using grid sampling from multiple fields, which provides context for the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they appear to be newly introduced by the authors. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are original contributions of the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and note that they are original datasets introduced in this research. I will ensure to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for referencing the datasets.

The citation for the paper is:

University of Regina, Regina SK, Canada; King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia; SDAIA-KFUPM Joint Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
