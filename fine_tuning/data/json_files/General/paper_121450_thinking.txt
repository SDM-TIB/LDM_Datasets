To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Genetically Modified Wolf Optimization with Stochastic Gradient Descent for Optimising Deep Neural Networks" by Manuel Bradicic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed algorithm was trained and tested on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the dataset in the **introduction**. The authors reference the CIFAR-10 dataset proposed by Krizhevsky et al. [1], which confirms its use in their experiments. This is a crucial step as it provides both the name of the dataset and the context in which it is used.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset, providing further confirmation of its relevance to their research. They compare their algorithm's performance against other algorithms using this dataset, which solidifies its importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
