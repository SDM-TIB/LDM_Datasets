To extract datasets from the research paper titled "U-Net vs Transformer: Is U-Net Outdated in Medical Image Registration?" by Xi Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **3D IXI brain dataset** and a **MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021 challenge dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **OASIS dataset**: This dataset consists of 416 cross-sectional T1-weighted MRI scans, with specific details about the preprocessing and the number of scans used for training and validation. The authors provide metrics for evaluating registration performance, which indicates its significance in their study.

2. **IXI dataset**: This dataset contains nearly 600 3D MRI scans from healthy subjects, and the authors specify how many images were used for training, validation, and testing. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken, which adds to the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **OASIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Marcus, D.S., Wang, T.H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J.G., Morris, J.C., Buckner, R.L. (2007). Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 19(9), 1498â€“1507.

- For the **IXI dataset**, the citation is:
  > IXI dataset. Available at: https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
