To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context" by Zihang Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that Transformer-XL achieves better performance on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention five datasets used for their experiments: **WikiText-103, enwik8, text8, One Billion Word, and Penn Treebank**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are mentioned, including any specific details about their characteristics or the tasks they are used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

1. **WikiText-103**:
   > Stephen Merity, Nitish Shirish Keskar, and Richard Socher. *Regularizing and optimizing LSTM language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.02182, 2017.

2. **enwik8**:
   > MultiMedia LLC. *Large text compression benchmark*. 2009. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/enwik8/.

3. **text8**:
   > MultiMedia LLC. *Large text compression benchmark*. 2009. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/text8/.

4. **One Billion Word**:
   > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, Philipp Koehn, and Tony Robinson. *One billion word benchmark for measuring progress in statistical language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.3005, 2013.

5. **Penn Treebank**:
   > Tomas Mikolov and Geoffrey Zweig. *Context dependent recurrent neural network language model*. SLT, 12(234-239):8, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and can be easily referenced in future work.
