To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing Network Features to Detect Erroneous Inputs" by Matt Gorbett and Nathaniel Blanchard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 3.2 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several baseline datasets and models for image classification:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 32 x 32 colored images of 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **Tiny ImageNet**: A 200-class subset of the ImageNet dataset, where images are cropped and resized to a resolution of 64 x 64. The citation for Tiny ImageNet is:
   > Stanford Johnson. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2015.

3. **ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 1000 classes of objects with varied dimensions and resolutions. The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

In **subsection 3.2.2 (Out-of-Distribution Datasets)**, the authors list additional datasets used for out-of-distribution detection:

4. **CIFAR-100**: Contains 32 x 32 colored images of 100 different classes. The citation for CIFAR-100 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

5. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset contains colored numbers with class labels 0 to 9. The citation for SVHN is:
   > Yuval Netzer et al. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2009.

6. **Scene UNderstanding (SUN)**: Contains images of scenes with varying resolutions. The citation for SUN is:
   > Jianxiong Xiao et al. *SUN database: Large-scale scene recognition from abbey to zoo*. In 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3485–3492. IEEE, 2010.

7. **Places365**: A dataset with 365 classes of scenes. The citation for Places365 is:
   > Bolei Zhou et al. *Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6):1452–1464, 2018.

8. **ImageNet-O**: Constructed from sampled images from ImageNet-22K. The citation for ImageNet-O is:
   > Dan Hendrycks et al. *Natural adversarial examples*. arXiv:1907.07174, 2020.

In **subsection 3.2.3 (Corruption Datasets)**, the authors mention:

9. **CIFAR-10-C, Tiny ImageNet-C, ImageNet-C**: These are image corruption datasets for testing model robustness. The citation for these datasets is:
   > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their citations to ensure they are ready for downstream processing or review. This structured approach will help me accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
