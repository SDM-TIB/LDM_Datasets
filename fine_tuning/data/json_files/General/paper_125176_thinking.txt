To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Forward-Backward Gaussian Variational Inference via JKO in the Buresâ€“Wasserstein Space" by Michael Diao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6 in this case) to look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

If the datasets are not clearly listed in the experiments section, I will check the **related works section** (Section 7) and the **conclusion** (Section 8) for any references to datasets that may have been used in previous studies or comparisons.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for presentation or further processing.
