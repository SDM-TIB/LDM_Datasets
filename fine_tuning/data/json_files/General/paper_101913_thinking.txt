To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Neural Coreference Resolution Revisited: A Simple Yet Effective Baseline" by Tuan Manh Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model outperforms all recent extended works on the public English OntoNotes benchmark, indicating that this benchmark is a dataset used in their evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the OntoNotes benchmark multiple times, which suggests it is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English data**, which is based on the OntoNotes corpus. They provide details about the train/dev/test split, confirming that this dataset is indeed utilized for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the OntoNotes dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **OntoNotes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sameer Pradhan, Alessandro Moschitti, Nianwen Xue, Olga Uryupina, and Yuchen Zhang. *Conll-2012 shared task: Modeling multilingual unrestricted coreference in ontonotes*. In EMNLP-CoNLL Shared Task, 2012.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will focus solely on the OntoNotes dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for the OntoNotes dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be structured according to the specified format for downstream processing.
