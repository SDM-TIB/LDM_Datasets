To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Streamlining in the Riemannian Realm: Efficient Riemannian Optimization with Loopless Variance Reduction" by Yury Demidovich, Grigory Malinovsky, and Peter Richt√°rik, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Datasets."** In these sections, authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "MNIST" or "CIFAR-10," I will record the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose in the study and any specific configurations used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for citations that provide the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured format, ready for further processing or review.
