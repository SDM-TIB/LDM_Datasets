To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tale of Two Languages: Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Spoken Language Supervision" by Charles Raude et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce new dataset annotations for continuous sign-level recognition, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors reference the **BOBSL dataset** as a large-scale dataset that provides weak supervision for their model. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In the **experiments section**, I will check for any additional datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using the **CSLR-TEST** dataset, which consists of continuous sign-level annotations for 6 hours of video. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation and should be included.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **related work section**. The authors mention **PHOENIX-2014** and **CSL-Daily** as benchmarks for continuous sign language recognition, which may also be relevant.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **BOBSL Dataset**:
   > Samuel Albanie, Gül Varol, Liliane Momeni, Hannah Bull, Triantafyllos Afouras, Himel Chowdhury, Neil Fox, Bencie Woll, Rob Cooper, Andrew McParland, and Andrew Zisserman. *BOBSL: BBC-Oxford British Sign Language dataset*. arXiv, 2021.

2. **PHOENIX-2014 Dataset**:
   > Oscar Koller, Jens Forster, and Hermann Ney. *Continuous sign language recognition: Towards large vocabulary statistical recognition systems handling multiple signers*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 141:108–125, 2015.

3. **CSL-Daily Dataset**:
   > Necati Cihan Camgoz, Simon Hadfield, Oscar Koller, Hermann Ney, and Richard Bowden. *Neural sign language translation*. In CVPR, 2018.

4. **CSLR-TEST Dataset**:
   > Charles Raude, Prajwal KR, Liliane Momeni, Hannah Bull, Samuel Albanie, Andrew Zisserman, Gül Varol. *A Tale of Two Languages: Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Spoken Language Supervision*. In CVPR, 2024.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
