To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compatible Transformer for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series" by Yuxi Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **3 real-world datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section VI)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **P19 Dataset**: This dataset is from the PhysioNet Sepsis Early Prediction Challenge 2019 and contains 38,803 patients monitored by 34 irregularly sampled sensors. Each patient is labeled by the occurrence of sepsis within the next 6 hours.

2. **P12 Dataset**: This dataset is from the PhysioNet Mortality Prediction Challenge 2012 and includes 11,988 patients. Each observation contains multivariate time series with 36 sensors, and it is associated with a binary label indicating the length of stay in the ICU.

3. **PAM Dataset**: This dataset is the PAMAP2 Physical Activity Monitoring dataset, which measures daily living activities of 9 subjects using 3 inertial measurement units. After modification, it contains 5,333 segments of sensory signals, each measured by 17 sensors and labeled into 8 classes representing different activities.

I will now look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **P19 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. A. Reyna, C. Josef, S. Seyedi, R. Jeter, S. P. Shashikumar, M. B. Westover, A. Sharma, S. Nemati, and G. D. Clifford. *Early prediction of sepsis from clinical data: the physionet/computing in cardiology challenge 2019*. In 2019 Computing in Cardiology (CinC), pages Page–1, 2019.

- For the **P12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. L. Goldberger, L. A. Amaral, L. Glass, J. M. Hausdorff, P. C. Ivanov, R. G. Mark, J. E. Mietus, G. B. Moody, C.-K. Peng, and H. E. Stanley. *Physiobank, physiotoolkit, and physionet: components of a new research resource for complex physiologic signals*. Circulation, vol. 101, no. 23, pp. e215–e220, 2000.

- For the **PAM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Reiss and D. Stricker. *Introducing a new benchmarked dataset for activity monitoring*. In 2012 16th International Symposium on Wearable Computers. IEEE, pages 108–109, 2012.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
