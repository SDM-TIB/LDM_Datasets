To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Neural Network Compression" by Hossein Baktash et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating neural networks on the **MNIST dataset and its variants**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the datasets. The authors state that they perform experiments on the **MNIST dataset and variants**, which reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST dataset** and its variants, including **MNIST with background images** and **MNIST with rotation**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the proper citation as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Additionally, since the paper discusses variants of the MNIST dataset, I will note that these variants are derived from the original MNIST dataset and do not have separate citations. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
