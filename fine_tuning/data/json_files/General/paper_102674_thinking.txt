To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatiotemporal Contrastive Learning of Facial Expressions in Videos" by Shuvendu Roy and Ali Etemad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were performed on the **Oulu-CASIA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the **Oulu-CASIA dataset** in detail, noting that it contains videos of facial expressions from 80 subjects, with six expressions being recognized: Happy, Sad, Surprised, Angry, Fear, and Disgust. This section provides essential information about the dataset's composition and context.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Oulu-CASIA dataset. The citation is as follows:
> G. Zhao, X. Huang, M. Taini, S. Z. Li, and M. Pietikäinen. *Facial expression recognition from near-infrared videos*. Image and Vision Computing, vol. 29, no. 9, pp. 607–619, 2011.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the Oulu-CASIA dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for the dataset mentioned in the paper.
