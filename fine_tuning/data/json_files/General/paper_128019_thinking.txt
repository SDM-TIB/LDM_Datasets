To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Intervention for Measuring Confidence in Drug-Target Interaction Prediction" by Wenting Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in drug discovery, which suggests that datasets related to drug-target interactions may be involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of computational prediction in drug-target interactions, indicating that datasets are likely utilized in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using two public knowledge graphs applicable to drug-target discovery: **Hetionet** and **BioKG**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments:
1. **Hetionet**: A comprehensive knowledge graph that integrates various biological data relevant to drug-target interactions.
2. **BioKG**: Another knowledge graph specifically designed for biological knowledge, which also supports drug-target interaction predictions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

- For **Hetionet**, the citation is:
  > H. Wang, J. Wang et al., “A novel approach for drug-target interactions prediction based on multimodal deep autoencoder,” *Frontiers in Pharmacology*, vol. 10, p. 1592, 2020.

- For **BioKG**, the citation is:
  > A. Ezzat, M. Wu et al., “Computational prediction of drug–target interactions using chemogenomic approaches: an empirical survey,” *Briefings in Bioinformatics*, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 1337–1357, 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
