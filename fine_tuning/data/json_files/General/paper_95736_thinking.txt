To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pixel precise unsupervised detection of viral particle proliferation in cellular imaging data" by Birgitta Dresp-Langley and John Mwangi Wandeto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention any specific datasets or prior studies that utilized datasets relevant to their work. This section often provides context and may reference foundational datasets.

In the **materials and methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. The authors mention generating 160 model images based on a previously published imaging model. I will need to identify the original dataset or model they are referencing, which is likely detailed in the references.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional insights or confirmations about the datasets used, particularly if the authors discuss the outcomes based on specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference a study by Haseltine et al. (2008) that describes the imaging model they used. I will ensure to extract the full citation for this study, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The relevant citation for the dataset/model used is:
- Haseltine EL, Lam V, Yin J, Rawlings JB. *Image-guided modeling of virus growth and spread*. Bull Math Biol. 2008;70(6):1730‚Äê1748.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the referenced dataset. This will provide a clear and complete record of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
