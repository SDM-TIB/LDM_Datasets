To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MOFormer: Self-Supervised Transformer model for Metal-Organic Framework Property Prediction" by Zhonglin Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a large dataset for self-supervised learning, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss various datasets used in the context of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). They specifically mention three public MOF datasets: **CoRE MOF 2019**, **hypothetical MOFs (hMOF)**, and **Boyd & Woo**. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets that are relevant to their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors elaborate on the datasets used for self-supervised pretraining and downstream tasks. They state that the pretraining dataset consists of the three datasets mentioned earlier, combined to create a large dataset of 413,535 unique MOFs. This section confirms the datasets' significance in their methodology.

The authors also mention the **QMOF dataset** in the context of downstream prediction tasks, which contains 20,375 MOFs with labels for DFT-calculated band gaps. Additionally, they refer to the **hMOF dataset**, which includes 137,652 MOFs with labels for CO2 and CH4 adsorption.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CoRE MOF 2019**:
   > Chung, Y. G.; Haldoupis, E.; Bucior, B. J.; Haranczyk, M.; Lee, S.; Zhang, H.; Vogiatzis, K. D.; Milisavljevic, M.; Ling, S.; Camp, J. S., et al. *Advances, updates, and analytics for the computation-ready, experimental metal–organic framework database: CoRE MOF 2019*. Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data 2019, 64, 5985–5998.

2. **Hypothetical MOFs (hMOF)**:
   > Wilmer, C. E.; Leaf, M.; Lee, C. Y.; Farha, O. K.; Hauser, B. G.; Hupp, J. T.; Snurr, R. Q. *Large-scale screening of hypothetical metal–organic frameworks*. Nature Chemistry 2012, 4, 83–89.

3. **Boyd & Woo**:
   > Boyd, P. G.; Chidambaram, A.; García-Díez, E.; Ireland, C. P.; Daff, T. D.; Bounds, R.; Gladysiak, A.; Schouwink, P.; Moosavi, S. M.; Maroto-Valer, M. M., et al. *Data-driven design of metal–organic frameworks for wet flue gas CO2 capture*. Nature 2019, 576, 253–256.

4. **QMOF**:
   > Rosen, A. S.; Iyer, S. M.; Ray, D.; Yao, Z.; Aspuru-Guzik, A.; Gagliardi, L.; Notestein, J. M.; Snurr, R. Q. *Machine learning the quantum-chemical properties of metal–organic frameworks for accelerated materials discovery*. Matter 2021, 4, 1578–1597.

5. **hMOF** (again, as it is used for different tasks):
   > Wilmer, C. E.; Leaf, M.; Lee, C. Y.; Farha, O. K.; Hauser, B. G.; Hupp, J. T.; Snurr, R. Q. *Large-scale screening of hypothetical metal–organic frameworks*. Nature Chemistry 2012, 4, 83–89.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure clarity and completeness in the extraction process. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
