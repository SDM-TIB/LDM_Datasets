To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Traffic Density Forecasting in Intelligent Transportation Systems Using Gated Graph Neural Networks" by Razib Hayat Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on traffic forecasting using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the significance of accurate traffic forecasting but does not specify any datasets used in the study.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about data collection. The authors mention gathering traffic-related data from the Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority, which includes information about the road network and traffic patterns. They specify that the dataset comprises around 100 location images, totaling approximately 350 images. This indicates that the dataset is related to traffic images but does not provide a formal name for it.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of different GNN architectures but do not introduce any new datasets. They focus on the results of their experiments using the data they collected.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name for the dataset, I will refer to it as the "Bangladesh Traffic Dataset" for the purpose of this extraction. However, I will note that the dataset is derived from the Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority.

Now, I will check the **references section** to see if any citations pertain to the dataset or methodologies used. The references primarily cite other research papers and methodologies but do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself.

Given that the dataset is not formally cited in the paper, I will create a citation entry based on the information provided about the source of the data:

- **Bangladesh Traffic Dataset**: Data collected from the Bangladesh Road and Transport Authority, encompassing traffic-related information and images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the informal name and the source of the data. This will allow for proper documentation of the dataset used in the study.

After completing this process, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further use or review.
