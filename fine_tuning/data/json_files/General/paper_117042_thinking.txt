To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MTet: Multi-domain Translation for English and Vietnamese" by Chinh Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that MTet is the largest publicly available parallel corpus for English-Vietnamese translation, consisting of 4.2 million high-quality training sentence pairs. This indicates that MTet is a significant dataset.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (MTet: a Machine Translation dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the MTet dataset. They mention that it includes 4.2 million training examples curated from various sources, which is crucial information for my extraction.

In this section, the authors describe the curation methodology, which includes combining existing sources, scoring and filtering, dynamic programming style alignment, and manual crawling and cleaning. This gives me a comprehensive understanding of how the dataset was constructed.

Additionally, I will look for any references to other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **IWSLT15 dataset**, which consists of 133K text pairs collected from TED talk transcripts, and **PhoMT**, which is another dataset mentioned as contributing to the overall training data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **MTet Dataset**: The citation for the MTet dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, as it is the primary contribution of the paper itself. However, I will note that it is a significant dataset created by the authors.

2. **IWSLT15 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. Cettolo, J. Niehues, S. Stükker, L. Bentivogli, R. Cattoni, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2015 Evaluation Campaign*. In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 2–14, Da Nang, Vietnam, 2015.

3. **PhoMT Dataset**: The citation for PhoMT is:
   > Long Doan, Linh The Nguyen, Nguyen Luong Tran, Thai Hoang, and Dat Quoc Nguyen. *PhoMT: A high-quality and large-scale benchmark dataset for Vietnamese-English machine translation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 4495–4503, Online and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
