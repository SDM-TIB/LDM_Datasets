To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative study of Deep Learning Models for Binary Classification on Combined Pulmonary Chest X-Ray dataset" by Md Aminul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study combines two datasets for tuberculosis diagnosis, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Materials and Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets used:

1. **Shenzhen Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collaborative effort between the National Library of Medicine in Maryland, USA, and the Shenzhen No. 3 People's Hospital in Guangdong, China. It consists of 662 instances, with 336 instances showing symptoms of tuberculosis and 326 classified as normal.

2. **Montgomery County Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the tuberculosis control program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. It contains 138 thoracic X-rays, with 80 classified as normal and 58 showing symptoms of tuberculosis.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Shenzhen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Library of Medicine. (2014). *Shenzhen-Hospital-CXR-Set*. Tuberculosis-Chest-X-ray-Datasets. Available: https://data.lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/public/Tuberculosis-Chest-X-ray-Datasets/Shenzhen-Hospital-CXR-Set/index.html

- For the **Montgomery County Dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Library of Medicine. (2014). *Montgomery County CXR Set*. Tuberculosis-Chest-X-ray-Datasets. Available: https://data.lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/public/Tuberculosis-Chest-X-ray-Datasets/Montgomery-County-CXR-Set/MontgomerySet/index.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured.
