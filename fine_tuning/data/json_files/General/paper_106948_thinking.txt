To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences" by Mandy Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on several summarization and question answering tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.2 (Evaluation on Summarization Tasks)** and **section 4.3 (Evaluation on QA Tasks)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.2.1, the authors mention six datasets for summarization tasks:

1. **CNN / Daily Mail**: This dataset consists of news articles from CNN and Daily Mail, with the article's summary bullets as the target summary.
2. **PubMed**: This dataset includes scientific documents collected from PubMed, where the document's content is used as input and its corresponding abstract as the target summary.
3. **arXiv**: Similar to PubMed, this dataset consists of documents taken from arXiv, with the document's content as input and the abstract as the target summary.
4. **BigPatent**: This dataset contains U.S. patent documents, using the patent's details as input and the patent's abstract as the target summary.
5. **MediaSum**: This dataset includes interview transcripts from CNN and NPR, with the corresponding topic and overviews as the target summary.
6. **Multi-News**: This dataset involves summarizing multiple news documents about a topic into a human-written summary.

In section 4.3.1, the authors discuss two datasets for question answering tasks:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset consists of real queries issued by users to Google search, with answer text drawn from the search results.
2. **TriviaQA**: This dataset contains trivia question-answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts, with answers drawn from Wikipedia and Bing web search results.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
