To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Texture-Preserving Diffusion Models for High-Fidelity Virtual Try-On" by Xu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on popular databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors mention that their approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular **VITON** and **VITON-HD** databases. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They mention that:

1. **VITON**: This dataset contains training and testing sets of 14,221 and 2,032 image pairs, respectively, with each image pair consisting of a front-view photo of a female and a reference garment. The image resolution is 256 × 192 pixels.

2. **VITON-HD**: Similar to VITON, this dataset has a higher resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels and is used for high-resolution virtual try-on tasks.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VITON**, the citation is:
  > Han, X., Wu, Z., Wu, Z., Yu, R., & Davis, L. (2018). *VITON: An image-based virtual try-on network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For **VITON-HD**, the citation is:
  > Choi, S., Park, S., Lee, M., & Choo, J. (2021). *VITON-HD: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
