To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SEM-CS: Semantic Clipstyler for Text-Based Image Style Transfer" by Chanda Grover Kamra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of image style transfer and mention previous works like CLIPStyler and Generative Artisan. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets at this point. 

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where they describe their framework, Semantic CLIPStyler (Sem-CS). This section may include details about the datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors reference any datasets for training their models or for evaluation purposes, I will note them down.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors present quantitative and qualitative evaluations of their method. They mention using metrics like DISTS and NIMA, but they do not specify any datasets directly in this section either. 

After reviewing these sections, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the study. The references may include papers that describe datasets or benchmarks relevant to their work.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if they reference a dataset like the "COCO dataset," I would look for the original paper that introduced it and provide the full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections for dataset mentions.
2. Check the references section for any relevant dataset citations.
3. Extract and compile the names and full citations of any identified datasets.
