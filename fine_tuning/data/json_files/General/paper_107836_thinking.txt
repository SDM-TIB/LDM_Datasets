To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Diversity Learning with Sample Dropout for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-identification" by Chunren Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset contains 32,668 labeled images of 1501 identities captured from 6 disjoint cameras. The training set includes 751 identities and 12,936 images, while the gallery set contains 19,732 images from 750 identities, and the query set has 3,368 images from 750 identities.

2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: This dataset includes 36,411 images of 1,402 identities, with 16,522 images of 702 identities designated for training. The gallery and query sets consist of 17,661 and 2,228 images from another 702 identities, respectively.

3. **MSMT17**: This dataset comprises 126,441 images of 4,101 identities, with 1,041 identities used for training and 3,060 identities for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:
  > Liang Zheng, Liyue Shen, Lu Tian, Shengjin Wang, Jingdong Wang, and Qi Tian. *Scalable person re-identification: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1116–1124, 2015.

- For **DukeMTMC-reID**, the citation is:
  > Ergys Ristani, Francesco Solera, Roger Zou, Rita Cucchiara, and Carlo Tomasi. *Performance measures and a data set for multi-target, multi-camera tracking*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 17–35, 2016.

- For **MSMT17**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
