To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UnsuperPoint: End-to-End Unsupervised Interest Point Detector and Descriptor" by Peter Hviid Christiansen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of UnsuperPoint on the **HPatch dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluated UnsuperPoint on the **HPatch dataset**, which contains 57 illumination scenes and 59 viewpoint scenes. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of the proposed method.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the HPatch dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **HPatch dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vassileios Balntas, Karel Lenc, Andrea Vedaldi, and Krystian Mikolajczyk. *HPatches: A benchmark and evaluation of handcrafted and learned local descriptors*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5173â€“5182, 2017.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HPatch dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the HPatch dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
