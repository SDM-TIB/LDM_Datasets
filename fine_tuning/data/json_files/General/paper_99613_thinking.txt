To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharp bounds for the number of regions of maxout networks and vertices of Minkowski sums" by Guido MontÃºfar, Yue Ren, and Leon Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise summary of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details such as the number of samples, features, and any specific conditions or splits used in the experiments.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who wants to access the datasets or understand their origins. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset named "Maxout Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, Year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
