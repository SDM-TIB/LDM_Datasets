To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Box2EL: Concept and Role Box Embeddings for the Description Logic EL++" by Mathias Jackermeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions an empirical evaluation and a novel benchmark for evaluating EL++ embedding models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on three tasks: subsumption prediction, link prediction, and deductive reasoning. They mention using three real-life ontologies for their evaluations, which likely serve as datasets.

I will specifically look for mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section** and any other relevant sections. Upon reviewing the text, I find the following datasets:

1. **GALEN Ontology**: This ontology is mentioned as part of the novel benchmark for subsumption prediction. It is a well-known ontology in the medical domain.
   
2. **Gene Ontology (GO)**: This ontology is used for link prediction tasks and is widely recognized in the field of bioinformatics.

3. **Anatomy Ontology (Uberon)**: This ontology is also used in the experiments and is relevant for biological and anatomical data.

4. **STRING Database**: This database is mentioned in the context of protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction, where it is combined with the Gene Ontology to form the ABox for the PPI task.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **GALEN Ontology**, the citation is:
  > Rector, A. L., Rogers, J. E., & Pole, P. (1996). The GALEN high level ontology. In *Medical Informatics Europe ’96*, pages 174–178. IOS Press.

- For **Gene Ontology**, the citation is:

- For **Anatomy Ontology (Uberon)**, the citation is:

- For **STRING Database**, the citation is:
  > Szklarczyk, D., Gable, A. L., Nastou, K. C., Lyon, D., Kirsch, R., Pyysalo, S., Doncheva, N. T., Legeay, M., Fang, T., Bork, P., Jensen, L. J., & von Mering, C. (2021). The STRING database in 2021: Customizable protein–protein networks, and functional characterization of user-uploaded gene/measurement sets. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 49(D1), D605–D612.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
