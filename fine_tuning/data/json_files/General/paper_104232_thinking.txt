To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coding for Straggler Mitigation in Federated Learning" by Siddhartha Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their proposed scheme achieves a training speed-up factor on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** or **results** sections. In the **numerical results** section, the authors explicitly state that they simulate a wireless setting with **D = 25 devices** and perform federated learning on the **MNIST** and **Fashion-MNIST** datasets. They provide details about how the data is distributed among devices, confirming that these datasets are indeed utilized in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. LeCun, C. Cortes, and C. J. C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. Aug. 2017, arXiv:1708.07747. [Online]. Available: https://research.zalando.com/project/fashion_mnist/fashion_mnist.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
