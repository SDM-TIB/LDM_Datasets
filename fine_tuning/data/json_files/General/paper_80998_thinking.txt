To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continuous Learning in Single-Incremental-Task Scenarios" by Davide Maltoni and Vincenzo Lomonaco, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention testing their approach on **CORe50 and iCIFAR-100**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of these datasets. In the experiments, the authors describe **CORe50** as a dataset specifically designed for continuous object recognition, consisting of 50 classes with a total of 2400 patterns per class for training and 900 patterns for testing. They also mention **iCIFAR-100**, which is a variant of the CIFAR-100 dataset, adapted for a single-incremental-task scenario.

I will then look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For **CORe50**, the citation is:
> Vincenzo Lomonaco and Davide Maltoni. *CORe50: a New Dataset and Benchmark for Continuous Object Recognition*. In Proceedings of the 1st Annual Conference on Robot Learning, volume 78 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 17â€“26. PMLR, 2017.

For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. PhD thesis, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
