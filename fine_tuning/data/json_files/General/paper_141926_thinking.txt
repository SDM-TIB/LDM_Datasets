To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UAV-enabled Collaborative Beamforming via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Saichao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or content.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the research. I will note down the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any specific metrics or benchmarks associated with them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy access and understanding for anyone reviewing the datasets used in this research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the importance of proper citation throughout the process.
