To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Membership Inference Attacks against Diffusion Models" by Tomoya Matsumoto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CelebA** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be included in my extraction.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly state that they utilize **CIFAR-10** and **CelebA** for their experiments, confirming their importance in the study.

Now, I will gather more detailed information about each dataset from the text. In the **experimental setting** subsection, the authors describe the **CIFAR-10** dataset as containing samples with 32x32 color pixels and the **CelebA** dataset as containing samples with center-cropped 64x64 color pixels. This information will help me provide a more comprehensive description of each dataset.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. "Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild." CoRR, vol. abs/1411.7766, 2014.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper credit to the original sources.
