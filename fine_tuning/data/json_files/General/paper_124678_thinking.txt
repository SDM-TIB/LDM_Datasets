To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Camera Radar Net for Accurate, Robust, Efficient 3D Perception" by Youngseok Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, CRN, is evaluated on the **nuScenes** dataset, which is a significant indicator that this dataset is used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **experiments** section. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors explicitly state that they conduct experiments on the **nuScenes** dataset, which provides radar point clouds at scale. This confirms that nuScenes is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **nuScenes Dataset**:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621â€“11631, 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the nuScenes dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the nuScenes dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further use or processing.
