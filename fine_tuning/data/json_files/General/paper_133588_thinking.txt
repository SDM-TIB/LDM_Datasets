To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conservative Predictions on Noisy Financial Data" by Omkar Nabar and Gautam Shroff, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "synthetic data as well as real financial market data," which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved. I will note this down as a starting point.

Next, I will carefully examine the **Materials** section, specifically **section 3**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they detail the types of data they worked with:

1. **Market Data**: The authors state that they used equity price data from the Indian equity market, captured as five-minute candles. They mention that the dataset consists of 45,522 points.

2. **Synthetic Data**: They describe the synthetic price data generated as sine waves with varying levels of noise. They specify that one of the synthetic datasets has 7,729 points with noise levels of [0.075, 0.05].

I will also check the **Experiments** section to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments and to gather any additional details about their characteristics or usage.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are described in the paper itself and do not appear to have separate publications, I will create citations based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations I will create are as follows:

- For the **Market Data**:
  > Nabar, O., & Shroff, G. (2023). Conservative Predictions on Noisy Financial Data. In 4th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF '23), November 27–29, 2023, Brooklyn, NY, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/3604237.3626859

- For the **Synthetic Data**:
  > Nabar, O., & Shroff, G. (2023). Conservative Predictions on Noisy Financial Data. In 4th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance (ICAIF '23), November 27–29, 2023, Brooklyn, NY, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA. https://doi.org/10.1145/3604237.3626859

Since both datasets are part of the same study, I will use the same citation for both.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in the required format. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
