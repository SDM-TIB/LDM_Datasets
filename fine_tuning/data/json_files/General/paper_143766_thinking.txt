To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Relevance and Magnitude for Resource-Aware DNN Pruning" by C. F. Chiasserini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a novel pruning approach and its evaluation, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for image classification experiments. This is a crucial dataset for their performance evaluation.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results** or **discussion** sections. However, based on the provided text, it appears that the primary dataset referenced is ImageNet.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is typically attributed to the following paper:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included.
