To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SARI: Simplistic Average and Robust Identification based Noisy Partial Label Learning" by Darshana Saravanan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments on **seven datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention the use of datasets in the context of Partial Label Learning (PLL) and Noisy Partial Label Learning (NPLL). This section may provide insights into the specific datasets they used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they constructed for their experiments. They mention four datasets for the PLL and NPLL benchmarks: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-100H**, and **CUB-200**. Additionally, they refer to three crowdsourced datasets: **Treeversity, Benthic**, and **Plankton**. I will note down these datasets and their descriptions as provided in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I need to extract:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **CIFAR-100H**:
   > This dataset is derived from CIFAR-100, so the same citation applies.

4. **CUB-200**:
   > Peter Welinder, Steve Branson, Takeshi Mita, Catherine Wah, Florian Schroff, Serge Belongie, and Pietro Perona. *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. 2010.

5. **Treeversity**:
   > Lars Schmarje, Vasco Grossmann, Claudius Zelenka, et al. *Is one annotation enough? - a data-centric image classification benchmark for noisy and ambiguous label estimation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:33215–33232, 2022.

6. **Benthic**:
   > Lars Schmarje, Vasco Grossmann, Claudius Zelenka, et al. *Is one annotation enough? - a data-centric image classification benchmark for noisy and ambiguous label estimation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:33215–33232, 2022.

7. **Plankton**:
   > Lars Schmarje, Vasco Grossmann, Claudius Zelenka, et al. *Is one annotation enough? - a data-centric image classification benchmark for noisy and ambiguous label estimation*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35:33215–33232, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
