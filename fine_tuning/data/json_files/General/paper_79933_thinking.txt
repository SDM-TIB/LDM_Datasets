To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Convolutional Neural Networks Under Adversarial Noise" by Jonghoon Jin, Aysegul Dundar, and Eugenio Culurciello, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed model on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experimental results section** (section 3) where the authors mention that their method was evaluated on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. They provide specific performance metrics for these datasets under various conditions, which confirms their use in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0575, 2014.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured.
