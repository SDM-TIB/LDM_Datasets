To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regularizing Variational Autoencoder with Diversity and Uncertainty Awareness" by Dazhong Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Yahoo Dataset**: This dataset is used for text modeling and is mentioned as part of the experimental setup. The authors refer to the specific train/validation/test splits they utilized.

2. **Yelp Dataset**: Similar to the Yahoo dataset, this is another text dataset used for sentiment analysis, and the authors provide details about the splits used for training, validation, and testing.

3. **OMNIGLOT Dataset**: This dataset is used for image modeling, specifically for handwritten character recognition. The authors mention the structure of the dataset and how it was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

- For the **Yahoo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Zichao, Zhiting Hu, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick. "Improved variational autoencoders for text modeling using dilated convolutions." In ICML, 2017.

- For the **Yelp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bowman, Samuel R., Gabor Angeli, Christopher Potts, and Christopher D. Manning. "A large annotated corpus for learning natural language inference." In EMNLP, 2015.

- For the **OMNIGLOT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lake, Brenden M., Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua B. Tenenbaum. "Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction." Science, 350(6266):1332â€“1338, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
