To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How Language-Neutral is Multilingual BERT?" by Jindřich Libovický et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on multilingual BERT (mBERT) and its semantic properties, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I find several datasets mentioned:

1. **WMT14 Multi-Parallel Corpus**: This dataset is used for parallel sentence retrieval and consists of 3,000 sentences in multiple languages including Czech, English, French, German, Hindi, and Russian.

2. **Manually Annotated Word Alignment Datasets**: These datasets are used to evaluate word alignment between English and several other languages, including:
   - Czech (2,500 sentences; Mareček, 2016)
   - Swedish (192 sentences; Holmqvist and Ahrenberg, 2011)
   - German (508 sentences)
   - French (447 sentences; Och and Ney, 2000)
   - Romanian (248 sentences; Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003)

3. **WMT19 Quality Estimation Data**: This dataset is used for machine translation quality estimation and consists of English-German data, including source sentences, their automatic translations, and manually corrected versions.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **WMT14 Multi-Parallel Corpus**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant datasets are documented accurately with their respective citations.
