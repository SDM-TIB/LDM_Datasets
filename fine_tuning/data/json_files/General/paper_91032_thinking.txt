To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generic Network Compression Framework for Sequential Recommender Systems" by Yang Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework, CpRec, is evaluated on "four real-world SRS datasets." This indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

In subsection 4.1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Weishi**: A private short-video recommendation dataset collected by Tencent, containing over 60,000 videos and interaction sequences of length 10.
   
2. **ML20**: A subset of the Movielens dataset, which has been filtered to include only interactions with a minimum threshold. It contains 54,000 items and 27.7 million actions, with sequences of length 20.

3. **TikTok**: A dataset targeting video recommendations based on historical watching behaviors, with 514,000 items and 38.2 million actions, and sequences of length 50.

4. **ML100**: Another subset of the Movielens dataset, containing 54,000 items and 27.7 million actions, with sequences of length 100.

5. **ColdRec**: A dataset used for transfer learning tasks, consisting of a source dataset with user interactions in the QQ Browser and a target dataset with fewer interactions in another system. It has 191,000 items in the source and 21,000 in the target.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Weishi**, since it is a private dataset, there may not be a formal citation, but I will note that it is collected by Tencent.
  
- For **Movielens**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The Movielens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

- For **TikTok**, as it is mentioned in the context of a challenge, I will note that it was released in the ICME 2019 short video understanding challenge, but a formal citation may not be available.

- For **ColdRec**, the citation is:
  > Fajie Yuan, Xiangnan He, Alexandros Karatzoglou, and Liguang Zhang. *Parameter-Efficient Transfer from Sequential Behaviors for User Modeling and Recommendation*. arXiv, 2020.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
