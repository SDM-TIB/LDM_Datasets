To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-bit-per-weight deep convolutional neural networks without batch-normalization layers for embedded systems" by Mark D. McDonnell et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods on various image classification datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the importance of batch normalization layers in deep convolutional networks and reference datasets like **ImageNet**, **CIFAR 10**, and **CIFAR 100**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methods section** where the authors describe the architectures and training processes. They specifically mention using **CIFAR 10** and **CIFAR 100** for their experiments, confirming their usage.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results for various models trained on these datasets, including detailed error rates for **CIFAR 10** and **CIFAR 100**. This further solidifies that these datasets are central to their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **CIFAR 10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR 100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Both CIFAR datasets are derived from the same technical report, which is crucial for proper citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
