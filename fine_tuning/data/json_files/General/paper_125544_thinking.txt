To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Security Region of Natural Gas Systems in Integrated Electricity-Gas Systems" by Han Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. These sections typically describe the data used for analysis, including any simulations or case studies. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or appendices that might contain dataset information.

In this paper, the authors discuss the evaluation of the dynamic security region (DSR) using various test systems, specifically mentioning a **10-node natural gas system** and a **67-node natural gas system**. I will note these systems as they represent the datasets used for the experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, such as parameters or configurations that define the test systems. The paper includes tables with parameters for the pipelines and gas-fired units, which are crucial for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations will include the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as volume, issue, pages, and DOI if available.

1. **10-node natural gas system**: The parameters for this system are detailed in Appendix B, but the original dataset or reference for this system is not explicitly cited in the paper. I will note that it is based on the authors' own configuration.

2. **67-node natural gas system**: This system is constructed based on the test system in the reference:
   > W. Jia, T. Ding, O. Han, C. Mu, and H. Zhang. "Benchmark datasets for fluid flow analysis," CSEE J. Power Energy Syst., early access, pp. 1-14, Dec. 2022, doi: 10.17775/CSEEJPES.2022.00530.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
