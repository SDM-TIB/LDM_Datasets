To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedTune: A Deep Dive into Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning with Pre-trained Transformers" by Jinyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of pre-trained Transformers in Federated Learning (FL) but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. I will note down these datasets as they are explicitly mentioned in the context of the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe how they utilize these datasets. They mention that CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, and CIFAR-100 is similar but has 100 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Since both datasets share the same citation, I will ensure to note that down correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details about the datasets used in the research paper.
