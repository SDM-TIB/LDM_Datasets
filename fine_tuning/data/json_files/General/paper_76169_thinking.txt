To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Trees: Classification with Sparse Pairwise Dependencies" by Yaniv Tenzer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any subsections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention various datasets in the **experimental results section**. I will compile a list of these datasets, noting their names, characteristics, and any relevant details provided.

The paper lists several datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **Blood Dataset**: Contains 748 samples with 4 features.
2. **Climate Model Simulation Crashes Dataset**: Contains 540 samples with 18 features.
3. **Hill-valley without noise Dataset**: Contains 606 samples with 100 features.
4. **Ionosphere Dataset**: Contains 351 samples with 32 features.
5. **Pima Dataset**: Contains 768 samples with 8 features.
6. **Sonar Dataset**: Contains 208 samples with 60 features.
7. **Vertebral Dataset**: Contains 310 samples with 6 features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, the citation for the **Blood Dataset** might be:
> Dheeru Dua and Efi Karra Taniskidou. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2017.

Similarly, I will gather citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I have the correct authors, titles, and publication details.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
