To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Meta-Transfer Derm-Diagnosis: Exploring Few-Shot Learning and Transfer Learning for Skin Disease Classification in Long-Tail Distribution" by Zeynep Özdemir et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluated their models using the **ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198 datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **SD-198 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 198 categories of skin diseases, with a total of 6,584 clinical images. The authors mention that the dataset captures a wide range of patient demographics and is divided into training and testing sets.

2. **Derm7pt Dataset**: This dataset includes over 2,000 clinical and dermoscopy images grouped into 20 classes. The authors describe how the dataset is used for training and evaluating computer-aided diagnosis systems.

3. **ISIC 2018 Skin Lesion Dataset**: This dataset contains 10,015 dermoscopic images categorized into seven classes. The authors detail the training and testing splits and the resizing of images for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SD-198 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaoxiao Sun, Jufeng Yang, Ming Sun, and Kai Wang. *A benchmark for automatic visual classification of clinical skin disease images*. In Computer Vision–ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11-14, 2016, Proceedings, Part VI 14, pages 206–222. Springer, 2016.

- For the **Derm7pt dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **ISIC 2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Noel Codella, Veronica Rotemberg, Philipp Tschandl, M Emre Celebi, Stephen Dusza, David Gutman, Brian Helba, Aadi Kalloo, Konstantinos Liopyris, Michael Marchetti, et al. *Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection 2018: A challenge hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.03368, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
