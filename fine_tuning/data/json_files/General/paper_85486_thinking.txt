To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LIP: Local Importance-based Pooling" by Ziteng Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **ImageNet** and **MS COCO** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss their experiments on the **ImageNet 1K classification task** and the **MS COCO detection task**. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their research.

Now, I will gather more information about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used. The paper states that the **ImageNet** dataset is used for image classification, while the **MS COCO** dataset is used for object detection tasks, particularly emphasizing the challenge of detecting small objects.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
