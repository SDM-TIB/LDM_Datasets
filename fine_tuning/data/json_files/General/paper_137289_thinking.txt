To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Setting the Record Straight on Transformer Oversmoothing" by GbÃ¨tondji J-S Dovonon, Michael Bronstein, and Matt J. Kusner, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction. Here, the authors discuss the performance of Transformer models across various domains but do not specify datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the experiments are described in section 5, which discusses image classification and text generation tasks. The authors mention using the **CIFAR100 dataset** for image classification and **The Pile dataset** for text generation.

I will now gather specific details about these datasets:

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 100 classes with 600 images per class. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of computer vision.

2. **The Pile**: This dataset is a large-scale dataset for language modeling, consisting of diverse text sources. It is specifically designed for training language models and has been widely used in NLP research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. [URL: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html]

- For **The Pile**, the citation is:
  > Gao, L., Biderman, S., Black, S., Golding, L., Hoppe, T., Foster, C., Phang, J., He, H., Thite, A., Nabeshima, N., et al. *The Pile: An 800GB dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper. 

I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
