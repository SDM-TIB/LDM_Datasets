To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pyramid Transformer for Traffic Sign Detection" by Omid Nejati Manzari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments are conducted on the **German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB)**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **introduction** section to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or its significance. The introduction discusses the challenges of traffic sign recognition and detection but primarily focuses on the proposed method rather than introducing new datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section III (Experiments)**, I will look for a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly mention the **GTSDB** dataset, providing information about its composition, including the number of images, the number of traffic signs, and the division into training and testing sets. This section confirms that GTSDB is the only dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GTSDB dataset. The paper cites the GTSDB as follows:

- **German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB)**:

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB)
   - **Description**: The GTSDB dataset contains natural traffic scenes recorded under various weather conditions and different types of roads. It includes 900 full images comprising 1206 traffic signs, split into a training set of 600 images and a test set of 300 images. The dataset has 43 classes of traffic signs.
   - **Citation**: J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. "Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition." *Neural Networks*, vol. 32, pp. 323–332, 2012.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citation is accurately represented for any downstream applications.
