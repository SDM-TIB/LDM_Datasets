To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pyramid Attention Network for Medical Image Registration" by Zhuoyuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public brain MRI datasets and one abdominal MRI dataset, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **IXI Dataset**: This dataset contains 576 brain MRI scans, each with 45 manually annotated regions of interest (ROIs). The authors specify that 461 scans were used for training and 115 for testing.

2. **LPBA40 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 40 brain MRI scans, each with 56 labeled ROIs. The authors indicate that 30 scans were used for training and 10 for testing.

3. **Learn2Reg AbdomenMRCT Dataset**: This dataset includes abdominal MRI scans with 4 annotated organs. The authors mention that 38 scans were used for training and 10 for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IXI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Shattuck, M. Mirza, V. Adisetiyo, C. Hojatkashani, G. Salamon, K. Narr, R. Poldrack, R. Bilder, and A. Toga. *Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures*. NeuroImage, vol. 39, no. 3, pp. 1064–1080, 2008.

- For the **LPBA40 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Hering, L. Hansen, T. Mok, A. Chung, H. Siebert, S. Häger, A. Lange, S. Kuckertz, S. Heldmann, W. Shao, et al. *Learn2Reg: comprehensive multi-task medical image registration challenge, dataset and evaluation in the era of deep learning*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 42, no. 3, pp. 697–712, 2022.

- For the **Learn2Reg AbdomenMRCT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Hering, L. Hansen, T. Mok, A. Chung, H. Siebert, S. Häger, A. Lange, S. Kuckertz, S. Heldmann, W. Shao, et al. *Learn2Reg: comprehensive multi-task medical image registration challenge, dataset and evaluation in the era of deep learning*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 42, no. 3, pp. 697–712, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
