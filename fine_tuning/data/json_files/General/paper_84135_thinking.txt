To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Source-Target Self Attention with Locality Constraints" by José A. R. Fonollosa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on several translation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various neural machine translation (NMT) architectures and mention the use of joint source-target representations. However, I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three specific datasets:

1. **IWSLT’14 German-English**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation, consisting of 160K training sentence pairs. The authors refer to the preprocessing script used for this dataset.

2. **WMT’14 English-German**: The authors state that they used preprocessed data containing 4.5M sentence pairs from the WMT’16 training data, which is tokenized and byte-pair encoded.

3. **WMT’14 English-French**: Similar to the English-German dataset, this dataset is preprocessed using a specific script and contains a joint source-target vocabulary of 40K tokens.

In the **results section**, the authors present BLEU scores for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **IWSLT’14 German-English**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Girardi, C., & Federico, M. (2014). *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT).

- For **WMT’14 English-German**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

- For **WMT’14 English-French**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into structured entries that can be used for further processing or review.
