To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust regression with covariate filtering: Heavy tails and adversarial contamination" by Ankit Pensia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the experiments.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that specifically discuss datasets, typically labeled as "Datasets," "Experiments," or similar. These sections usually provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any specific details provided by the authors. This includes the number of samples, features, and any relevant statistics or properties of the datasets.

4. **Check References for Citations**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references section of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will compile the following information:
   - **Name of the Dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.
   - **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all datasets mentioned in the paper are accounted for and that the citations are accurate.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper, complete with proper citations.
