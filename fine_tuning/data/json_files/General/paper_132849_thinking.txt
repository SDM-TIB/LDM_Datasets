To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIT-RECIPROCAM: GRADIENT AND ATTENTION-FREE VISUAL EXPLANATIONS FOR VISION TRANSFORMER" by Seok-Yong Byun and Wonju Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of explainability in Vision Transformers (ViT) and mention the use of the **ADCC metric** for evaluation, but they do not specify any datasets yet.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Quantitative Analysis)**, they mention that they evaluated their method on the **ILSVRC2012 validation set**, which contains 50,000 samples. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ILSVRC2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the **ILSVRC2012 validation set**. I will now prepare the dataset entry based on the information collected.

In summary, I have identified the dataset used in the experiments and retrieved its full citation, which is crucial for proper documentation and referencing.
