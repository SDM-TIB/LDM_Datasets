To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query-Key Normalization for Transformers" by Alex Henry et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors show improvements on "5 low-resource translation pairs from the TED Talks corpus and IWSLT’15." This indicates that there are specific datasets involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they trained on the same 5 low-resource translation pairs as Nguyen and Salazar (2019), which include:

1. **TED Talks Corpus**: The authors specify that they used four language pairs from this corpus: Arabic to English, Slovak to English, Galician to English, and English to Hebrew.
2. **IWSLT’15 Corpus**: They also mention using the English to Vietnamese translation pair from this corpus.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **TED Talks Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Qi, Y., Sachan, D., Felix, M., Padmanabhan, S., & Neubig, G. (2018). When and why are pre-trained word embeddings useful for neural machine translation? In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 529–535, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **IWSLT’15 Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Cettolo, M., Niehues, J., Stüker, S., Bentivogli, L., Cattoni, R., & Federico, M. (2015). The IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, pages 1–12, Da Nang, Vietnam.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **TED Talks Corpus**: Contains multiple language pairs used for translation tasks, specifically Arabic to English, Slovak to English, Galician to English, and English to Hebrew.
2. **IWSLT’15 Corpus**: Includes the English to Vietnamese translation pair.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented and attributed to its source. This structured approach will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets from the paper.
