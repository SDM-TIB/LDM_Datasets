To extract datasets from the research paper titled "High-Definition Map Generation Technologies for Autonomous Driving" by Zhibin Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions various organizations that have created HD maps, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these maps. The introduction provides context about HD maps and references specific projects, which may lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will examine **section II (Data Collection for HD Maps)**, where the authors discuss data collection methods and mention specific datasets. Here, they reference the **KITTI dataset**, **Level5 Lyft Dataset**, and **nuScenes Dataset** as open-sourced datasets available for researchers. This section is crucial as it explicitly lists datasets used in the context of HD map generation.

In **section III (Point Cloud Map Generation)**, the authors describe various mapping techniques and may reference additional datasets used for evaluation or comparison. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in this section.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide complete information for each dataset.

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. Int. J. Rob. Res., vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 1231–1237, Sep. 2013. doi: 10.1177/0278364913491297.

2. **Level5 Lyft Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Level5. *Behind the map: how we keep our maps up to date*. [Online]. Available: https://www.tomtom.com/blog/maps/continuous-map-processing/.

3. **nuScenes Dataset**: The citation is:
   > H. Caesar, V. Bankiti, A. H. Lang, S. Vora, V. E. Liong, Q. Xu, A. Krishnan, Y. Pan, G. Baldan, and O. Beijbom. *Nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proc. IEEE Comput. Soc. Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recognit., 2020, pp. 11618–11628.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper while providing proper citations for each.
