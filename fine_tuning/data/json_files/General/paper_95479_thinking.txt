To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Unknot" by Sergei Gukov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that discuss how the authors generated or utilized datasets. In this paper, the authors mention generating databases of non-trivial knots and unknots using algorithms. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

In **Section 3 (Generating Knots and Unknots)**, the authors describe two algorithms: **RandomUnknot** and **RandomKnot**. They mention that these algorithms produce databases of over 10,000 non-trivial knots and unknots of various lengths. However, they do not provide specific names for these datasets, so I will note that they refer to generated datasets without formal titles.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if the authors mention any datasets used for training their models or for testing the performance of their algorithms. They discuss training on braids and evaluating the performance of their models, but again, they do not provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets or prior works that include datasets, I will extract those citations.

Based on my review, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **Database of Non-Trivial Knots**: Generated using the RandomKnot algorithm, containing over 10,000 non-trivial knots of various lengths.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **Database of Unknots**: Generated using the RandomUnknot algorithm, containing over 10,000 unknots of various lengths.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

Since the authors do not provide formal citations for these generated datasets, I will note that they are derived from the algorithms described in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the relevant citations or notes about the lack of formal titles for the datasets.
