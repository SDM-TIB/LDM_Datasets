To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FCNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for Arbitrary-Length Exposure Estimation" by Jin Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a benchmark dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly state that they used a dataset from a previous work, which contains 24,330 images rendered from the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset with various exposure values. This is a clear indication of the dataset's relevance to their work.

The authors provide details about the dataset, including its size and the specific exposure values used. They mention that the dataset is divided into a training set, validation set, and test set, which is important for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset is referenced as follows:

- For the dataset used in the experiments, the citation is:
  > M. Afifi, K. G. Derpanis, B. Ommer, M. S. Brown. *Learning multi-scale photo exposure correction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9157â€“9167, 2021.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset's origin and context.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
