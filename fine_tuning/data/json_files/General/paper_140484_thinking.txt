To extract datasets from the research paper titled "scVGAE: A Novel Approach using ZINB-Based Variational Graph Autoencoder for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Imputation" by Yoshitaka Inoue, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methods and experiments for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of dropout events in single-cell RNA sequencing and mentions various imputation methods, but does not specify datasets yet. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the author lists the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I find a table summarizing 14 scRNA-seq datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of cells, genes, and density percentages. The datasets are:

1. **Baron Dataset**: GSE84133, 1937 cells, 20125 genes, 14% density.
2. **Brosens Dataset**: GSE168405, 5829 cells, 20697 genes, 11% density.
3. **Carey Dataset**: SCP1903, 9082 cells, 27202 genes, 10% density.
4. **cbmc Dataset**: GSE100866, 8617 cells, 20501 genes, 16% density.
5. **Chang Dataset**: GSE125527, 22770 cells, 10160 genes, 8% density.
6. **Fujii Dataset**: GSE119969, 2484 cells, 14679 genes, 9% density.
7. **hcabm40k Dataset**: Seurat, 12000 cells, 17369 genes, 8% density.
8. **Hrvatin Dataset**: GSE102827, 7390 cells, 19155 genes, 8% density.
9. **Jakel Dataset**: GSE118257, 8000 cells, 21581 genes, 8% density.
10. **Jiang Dataset**: GSE156456, 1014 cells, 25742 genes, 8% density.
11. **Manno Dataset**: GSE76381, 1977 cells, 19531 genes, 26% density.
12. **Mingyao Dataset**: GSE189539, 6840 cells, 13007 genes, 8% density.
13. **pbmc3k Dataset**: GSE189539, 2638 cells, 13714 genes, 9% density.
14. **Xu Dataset**: GSE189539, 8196 cells, 19988 genes, 14% density.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The Baron dataset citation is:
> Baron, M., et al. (2016). *A Single-Cell Transcriptomic Map of the Human and Mouse Pancreas Reveals Inter- and Intra-cell Population Structure*. Cell Systems, 3(4), 346â€“360.e4. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2016.08.011

For the Brosens dataset, the citation is:
> Boland, B.S., et al. (2020). *Heterogeneity and clonal relationships of adaptive immune cells in ulcerative colitis revealed by single-cell analyses*. Science Immunology, 5(50), eabb4432.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the table to ensure I have the correct citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets from the research paper.
