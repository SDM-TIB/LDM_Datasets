To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Neuron Allocation for Scale Aggregation Networks" by Yi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of ScaleNet on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, which suggests that these datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors detail their evaluations on the **ImageNet** and **MS COCO** datasets. They mention that ScaleNet achieves improved performance on these datasets, indicating their significance in the research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. **ImageNet**:
   > A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. E. Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In NIPS, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

2. **MS COCO**:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.
2. **MS COCO**: A dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, containing images with complex scenes and multiple objects.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
