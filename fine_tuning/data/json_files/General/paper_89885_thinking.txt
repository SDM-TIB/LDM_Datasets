To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLUECorpus2020: A Large-scale Chinese Corpus for Pre-training Language Model" by Liang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the release of **CLUECorpus2020**, a large-scale corpus for pre-training language models, which indicates that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **dataset description section** (Section 3) to gather detailed information about **CLUECorpus2020**. Here, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, including its size (100 GB), the number of characters (35 billion), and its source (Common Crawl). They also mention the structure of the dataset, which includes training, development, and test sets.

In Section 4, titled **Dataset Construction**, the authors elaborate on how the dataset was created, including the filtering and extraction processes used to ensure quality. This section reinforces the significance of **CLUECorpus2020** as a well-defined dataset for pre-training.

I will also check the **experiments section** (Section 6) to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or used in conjunction with **CLUECorpus2020**. However, the focus remains primarily on this dataset.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for **CLUECorpus2020**. The citation is as follows:
> Liang Xu, Xuanwei Zhang, Qianqian Dong. *CLUECorpus2020: A Large-scale Chinese Corpus for Pre-training Language Model*. CLUE Organization. Available at: https://github.com/CLUEbenchmark/CLUECorpus2020/

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **CLUECorpus2020**, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset as presented in the paper.
