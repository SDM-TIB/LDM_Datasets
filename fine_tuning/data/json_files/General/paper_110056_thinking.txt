To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision Transformer Equipped with Neural Resizer on Facial Expression Recognition Task" by Hyeonbin Hwang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges in facial expression recognition (FER) and hints at the use of datasets, but I need to look for specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of using datasets obtained from crowdsourcing, which suggests that they will reference specific datasets later in the paper. I will pay close attention to any dataset names that might be introduced.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **FERPlus**: This dataset consists of 28,709 training images, 3,589 validation images, and 3,589 test images, all in grayscale with a size of 48 × 48. Each image is annotated with one of eight expression classes (neutral, happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, contempt) by a total of 10 annotators.

2. **RAF-DB**: This dataset contains 29,672 facial images annotated with basic or compound expressions, labeled independently by 40 annotators. The authors specifically use an aligned version of RAF-DB, which includes 12,271 training images and 3,068 test images, all resized to 100 × 100.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FERPlus**, the citation is:
  > Li, S., & Deng, W. (2017). "Reliable crowdsourcing and deep locality-preserving learning for expression recognition in the wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2852-2861.

- For **RAF-DB**, the citation is:
  > Li, S., & Deng, W. (2019). "Deep facial expression recognition: A survey." IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 1-1.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
