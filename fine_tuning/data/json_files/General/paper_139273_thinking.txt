To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The effect of Leaky ReLUs on the training and generalization of overparameterized networks" by Yinglong Guo, Shaohan Li, and Gilad Lerman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using various datasets for their numerical experiments, which is crucial for understanding the practical implications of their theoretical findings.

In the **experiments section**, I will note the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset is generated from a normalized Gaussian distribution and is used to validate the theoretical claims made in the paper.
2. **F-MNIST**: A standard dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, consisting of grayscale images of clothing items.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, containing 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
4. **California Housing**: A dataset derived from the 1990 U.S. Census, used for regression tasks to predict housing prices.
5. **IMDB Movie Reviews**: A dataset for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. This is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract are:
- For the **Synthetic Dataset**, since it is generated, I will note the method of generation as described in the paper.
- For **F-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. CoRR, abs/1708.07747.
  
- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Available at https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf.
  
- For **California Housing**, the citation is:
  > Pace, R. K., & Barry, R. (1997). Sparse spatial autoregressions. Statistics & Probability Letters, 33(3), 291-297.
  
- For **IMDB Movie Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (pp. 142-150).

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured and can be easily accessed by others interested in the datasets used in this research.
