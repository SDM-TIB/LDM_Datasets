To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSGNN: A Dual-View Supergrid-Aware Graph Neural Network for Regional Air Quality Estimation" by Xin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this case, the authors explicitly mention two datasets: **YRD-AOD** and **BTH-AOD**. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their sources and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following information about the datasets:

1. **YRD-AOD**: This dataset is collected from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019. It includes AOD data, meteorology data, and air quality data. The AOD data is sourced from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, while meteorology data is obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and air quality data is from the China National Environmental Monitoring Center.

2. **BTH-AOD**: Similar to YRD-AOD, this dataset is collected from the Beijing Tianjin Hebei (BTH) region, also covering the same time period. It includes the same types of data as YRD-AOD, sourced from the same institutions.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **YRD-AOD**, the citation is:
  > Wei, J., Li, Z., Guo, J., Sun, L., Huang, W., Xue, W., Fan, T., & Cribb, M. (2019). Satellite-derived 1-KM-resolution PM1 concentrations from 2014 to 2018 across China. *Environmental Science & Technology*, 53(22), 13265-13274.

- For **BTH-AOD**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, Q., Wang, Y., Chang, H. H., Meng, X., Geng, G., Lyapustin, A., & Liu, Y. (2017). Full-coverage high-resolution daily PM2.5 estimation using MAIAC AOD in the Yangtze River Delta of China. *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 199, 437-446.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or analysis.
