To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Representations of Deep Neural Networks" by Simon Wiedemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a summary of the work and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract discusses the efficiency of new matrix representations but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** for any references to datasets. This section often provides context for the research and may include mentions of datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks. However, it appears that the introduction focuses more on the theoretical aspects of neural networks rather than specific datasets.

I will then look into the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using weight matrices from various state-of-the-art networks such as **AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet152, and DenseNet**. However, they do not provide specific datasets associated with these networks in the experimental results.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might refer to datasets indirectly. For instance, if the authors cite papers that introduced these networks, those papers may contain information about the datasets used to train or evaluate those networks.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following relevant citations:

1. **AlexNet**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton. "ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks." In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25, 2012, pp. 1097–1105.

2. **VGG-16**:
   > Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman. "Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition." arXiv:1409.1556, 2014.

3. **ResNet152**:
   > Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. "Deep residual learning for image recognition." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016, pp. 770–778.

4. **DenseNet**:
   > Gao Huang, Zhuang Liu, and Kilian Q. Q. Weinberger. "Densely connected convolutional networks." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 2261–2269.

Now that I have identified the relevant citations, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information extracted from the paper and the references. Although the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, the networks referenced are typically evaluated on standard datasets such as ImageNet.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly, including the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets associated with the experiments discussed in the paper.
