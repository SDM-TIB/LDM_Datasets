To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variable Name Recovery in Decompiled Binary Code using Constrained Masked Language Modeling" by Pratyay Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on a large-scale dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they used. They mention the **DIRE dataset**, which consists of 3,195,962 decompiled x86-64 functions and their corresponding abstract syntax trees with annotations of the decompiled variable names and their original names. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its size, source, and structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIRE dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the DIRE dataset is:
> Jeremy Lacomis, Pengcheng Yin, Edward Schwartz, Miltiadis Allamanis, Claire Le Goues, Graham Neubig, and Bogdan Vasilescu. *DIRE: A neural approach to decompiled identifier naming*. In 2019 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE). IEEE, 628â€“639.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the dataset description section for detailed information.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references for proper attribution.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
