To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing the reliability of a bank with Logistic Regression and Particle Swarm Optimization" by Vadlamani Ravi and Vadlamani Madhav, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives, but I need to look for specific datasets in the later sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Description of the datasets)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention three datasets: 

1. **Spanish banks dataset**: This dataset is obtained from Olmeda and Fernandez (1997) and includes data from 66 banks, with 37 banks having gone bankrupt and 29 banks being healthy. The financial ratios used are derived from the last financial statements before bankruptcy for failed banks and from 1982 statements for non-failed banks.

2. **Turkish banks dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Canbas et al. (2005) and contains data from 40 banks, with 18 banks having gone bankrupt and 22 banks being healthy. The dataset includes 12 financial ratios identified as early warning indicators.

3. **UK banks dataset**: Taken from Beynon and Peel (2001), this dataset consists of 60 samples, with 30 banks being healthy and 30 banks having gone bankrupt.

After identifying the datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Spanish banks dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olmeda, I., & Fernandez, E. (1997). Hybrid classifiers for financial multicriteria decision making: The case of bankruptcy prediction. *Computational Economics*, 10, 317–335.

- For the **Turkish banks dataset**, the citation is:
  > Canbas, S., Caubak, A., & Kilic, S. B. (2005). Prediction of commercial bank failure via multivariate statistical analysis of financial structures: The Turkish case. *European Journal of Operational Research*, 166, 528–546.

- For the **UK banks dataset**, the citation is:
  > Beynon, M. J., & Peel, M. J. (2001). Variable precision rough set theory and data discretisation: an application to corporate failure prediction. *Omega*, 29, 561–576.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as presented in the research paper.
