To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPINIONDIGEST: A Simple Framework for Opinion Summarization" by Yoshihiko Suhara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the framework was evaluated on YELP data, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. The introduction may provide additional context or mention other datasets.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **YELP Dataset**: This is described as a public corpus of restaurant reviews, specifically filtered to match the specifications of a previous study, resulting in 624K training reviews. The authors also note that they used gold-standard summaries for 200 restaurants from the same dataset.

2. **HOTEL Dataset**: This is a private dataset consisting of 688K reviews for 284 hotels collected from various hotel booking websites. The authors clarify that there are no gold-standard summaries for this dataset, and evaluations were conducted by human judges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The YELP dataset is referenced in relation to a previous work by Chu and Liu (2019), which I will need to cite accordingly. The HOTEL dataset does not have a specific citation since it is private, but I will note its details as described in the paper.

The full citation for the YELP dataset is:
> Eric Chu and Peter J. Liu. *MeanSum: A neural model for unsupervised multi-document abstractive summarization*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 1223â€“1232, 2019.

For the HOTEL dataset, since it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation, I will summarize its characteristics as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations and descriptions as required. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
