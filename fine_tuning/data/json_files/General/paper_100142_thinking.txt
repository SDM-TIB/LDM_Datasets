To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Human Decision-Support System in Medical Domain" by Samanta Knapic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves medical image data obtained from Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE), which suggests that there is a dataset related to medical images.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the part where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Red Lesion Endoscopy dataset**, which consists of 3,295 images, including both images with lesions and those without. They specify that this dataset is crucial for their analysis of explainable AI methods.

In the methodology, the authors detail that the dataset is divided into two sets: the first set contains 1,131 images with lesions and 2,164 without lesions, while the second set contains 439 images with lesions and 151 without lesions. They also mention that all lesions were manually annotated by a trained physician, which adds credibility to the dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations for the datasets, I will check the **references section**. The authors cite the source of the Red Lesion Endoscopy dataset as follows:

- **Red Lesion Endoscopy Dataset**: 
  > Coelho, P., Pereira, A., Salgado, M., & Cunha, A. (2018). *A deep learning approach for red lesions detection in video capsule endoscopies*. In International Conference Image Analysis and Recognition (pp. 553â€“561). Springer.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
