To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context Tuning for Retrieval Augmented Generation" by Raviteja Anantha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses a synthetic dataset created to simulate user interactions with digital assistants, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology)**, specifically the **3.1 Data Generation** subsection, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they generated a synthetic dataset with 791 unique personas and a total of 5,274 queries (4,338 for training and 936 for evaluation). This dataset is structured to reflect various user activities across seven applications.

The paper does not provide a specific name for the dataset, but it describes it as a synthetic dataset for evaluating context tuning in RAG-based planning systems. I will refer to it as the **Implicit Query Dataset** for clarity.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is synthetic and generated by the authors using GPT-4, there may not be a formal citation for it. Instead, I will note that the dataset was created using GPT-4, which is mentioned in the paper.

The relevant details for the dataset are as follows:

1. **Implicit Query Dataset**: This dataset consists of 791 unique personas and includes 4,338 training queries and 936 evaluation queries. It was generated using GPT-4 to simulate realistic interactions with digital assistant applications.

Since there are no additional datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details and the context of the dataset creation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entry, ensuring that the citation for GPT-4 is included as it is the tool used for generating the dataset.

The citation for GPT-4 is:
> OpenAI. 2023. *GPT-4 Technical Report*.

Now, I will create the dataset entry based on this information.
