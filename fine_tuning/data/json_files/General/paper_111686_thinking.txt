To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedBR: Improving Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data via Local Learning Bias Reduction" by Yongxin Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the experiments conducted on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 5). Here, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **RotatedMNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **CIFAR100** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for the research.

I will then check the **related works** and **methodology sections** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors provide more context about how these datasets were used. However, the primary focus remains on the three datasets identified.

After confirming the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **RotatedMNIST**: The dataset is a variant of the MNIST dataset, which is commonly used in machine learning research. The original MNIST dataset citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR10**: The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **CIFAR100**: The citation for the CIFAR100 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
