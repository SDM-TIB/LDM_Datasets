To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End User Behavior Retrieval in Click-Through Rate Prediction Model" by Qiwei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using both public and industrial datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of user behavior sequences in CTR prediction, hinting at the datasets used for this purpose.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets in **section 5.1 (Datasets)**. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Taobao Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing user behavior logs from the Taobao Mobile App, including various interactions such as clicks and purchases. It consists of 100 million instances, with an average of 101 interactions per user.

2. **Industrial Dataset**: This dataset is collected from a top-tier mobile app and contains over 142 billion instances, with a much longer user behavior sequence. It includes impression interactions, which are crucial for CTR modeling.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Taobao Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Zhu, Daqing Chang, Ziru Xu, Pengye Zhang, Xiang Li, Jie He, Han Li, Jian Xu, and Kun Gai. *Joint optimization of tree-based index and deep model for recommender systems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.07565, 2019.

- For the **Industrial Dataset**, the paper states that it will be released to the public for research purposes, but does not provide a specific citation yet. Therefore, I will note that it is an internal dataset and will require further information upon its release.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
