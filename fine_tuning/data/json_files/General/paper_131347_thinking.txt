To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TEXTROLSPEECH: A TEXT STYLE CONTROL SPEECH CORPUS WITH CODEC LANGUAGE TEXT-TO-SPEECH MODELS" by Shengpeng Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract introduces **TextrolSpeech**, which is described as a large-scale speech emotion dataset annotated with rich text attributes. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (TextrolSpeech Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the dataset. They mention that **TextrolSpeech** consists of 330 hours of speech data and 236,220 natural text style descriptions. This section confirms that **TextrolSpeech** is the main dataset of interest.

In addition to **TextrolSpeech**, the authors reference other datasets used in the creation of this dataset. Specifically, they mention integrating the clean portion of the **LibriTTS dataset** and the **VCTK dataset**. I will need to gather information about these datasets as well.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **data collection** section, where the authors discuss the emotional datasets they curated, including **ESD**, **TESS**, **MEAD**, **SAVEE**, and **MESS**. Each of these datasets contributes to the emotional content of **TextrolSpeech**.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **TextrolSpeech**:
   - Citation: This dataset is introduced in the paper itself, so I will cite it as:

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details and citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow me to create a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the research.
