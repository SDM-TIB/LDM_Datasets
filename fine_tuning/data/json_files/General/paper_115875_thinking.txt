To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Lifecycle Management in Evolving Input Distributions for Learning-based Aerospace Applications" by Somrita Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide an open-source benchmark of a satellite pose estimation model trained on images of a satellite in space. This suggests that there may be a specific dataset associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the ExoRomper dataset, which is developed by The Aerospace Corporation. This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In **section 4 (Evaluation Benchmark)**, the authors describe the ExoRomper dataset in detail, stating that it contains simulated camera images of a maneuverable model spacecraft along with ground truth labels of the satellite model’s pose. This section confirms that the ExoRomper dataset is used for evaluating their proposed algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ExoRomper dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the ExoRomper dataset, but it mentions that it was developed in support of Aerospace’s Slingshot program. I will note that the dataset is associated with the Slingshot program, which may have its own documentation or citation.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the findings:

1. **ExoRomper Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the algorithms proposed in the paper. It includes simulated camera images of a satellite and ground truth labels for pose estimation.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the ExoRomper dataset, I will note that it is associated with the Aerospace Corporation's Slingshot program, and I will recommend checking the program's documentation for further details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
