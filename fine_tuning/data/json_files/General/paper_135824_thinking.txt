To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Report Generation for Histopathology Images Using Pre-Trained Vision Transformers and BERT" by Saurav Sengupta and Donald E. Brown, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of high-resolution histopathology images and mentions a dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal, which is a strong indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their research. They specifically mention the GTEx dataset, which consists of 9911 training samples, 972 validation samples, and 984 testing samples. The authors describe how they utilize this dataset to create descriptions for each tissue type.

In this section, they also reference other datasets, including the ARCH dataset by Gamper and Rajpoot, and the dataset used by Tsuneki and Kanavati. However, they clarify that the GTEx dataset is the primary dataset they used due to its high resolution and associated descriptions.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but I can reference the GTEx portal as follows:
   > GTEx Consortium. *The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project*. Available at: https://www.gtexportal.org/home/histologyPage.

2. **ARCH dataset**: The citation for the ARCH dataset is:
   > Jevgenij Gamper and Nasir Rajpoot. *Multiple instance captioning: Learning representations from histopathology textbooks and articles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2021, pp. 16549–16559.

3. **Dataset from Tsuneki and Kanavati**: The citation is:
   > Masayuki Tsuneki and Fahdi Kanavati. *Inference of captions from histopathological patches*. In International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning. PMLR, 2022, pp. 1235–1250.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
