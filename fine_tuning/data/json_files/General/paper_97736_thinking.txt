To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Introduction to Neural Transfer Learning with Transformers for Social Science Text Analysis" by Sandra Wankmüller, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on transfer learning and mentions comparing three Transformer-based models on various applications, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses various applications of supervised learning in social science, but I need to find explicit references to datasets.

In the **applications section (Section 6)**, the author describes three datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Ethos Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,644 sentences from debates in the UK parliament, with annotations regarding whether sentences refer to the ethos of another politician or party. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Duthie, R., & Budzynska, K. (2018). A deep modular RNN approach for ethos mining. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI-18 (pp. 4041–4047). International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization. https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2018/562

2. **Legalization of Abortion Dataset**: This dataset contains 933 tweets regarding the legalization of abortion, annotated for stance (favor, against, neutral). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mohammad, S. M., Sobhani, P., & Kiritchenko, S. (2017). Stance and sentiment in tweets. ACM Transactions on Internet Technology, 17(3), 1–22. https://doi.org/10.1145/3003433

3. **Wikipedia Toxic Comment Dataset**: This dataset includes 159,571 comments from Wikipedia Talk pages, annotated for toxicity. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jigsaw/Conversation AI (2018). Toxic comment classification challenge. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
