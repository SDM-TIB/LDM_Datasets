To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Virtual Classification: Modulating Domain-Specific Knowledge for Multidomain Crowd Counting" by Mingyue Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets are used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of crowd counting across multiple domains and mention the need for diverse datasets. This indicates that they likely reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using four public crowd counting datasets: **ShanghaiTech A/B**, **UCF-QNRF**, and **NWPU**. I will take note of these datasets and look for detailed descriptions.

In the **dataset description** part of the experiments, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **ShanghaiTech A**: Contains 1,198 images with a total of 330,165 annotated heads. It includes 300 training images and 182 testing images, with crowd numbers varying from 33 to 3,139.

2. **ShanghaiTech B**: Comprises 400 training images and 316 test images, with crowd numbers varying from 9 to 578, captured from Shanghai street views.

3. **UCF-QNRF**: A large dataset with 1,535 high-resolution images, where 1,201 images are used for training and 334 for testing. It contains 1.25 million annotated heads, featuring extreme congestion and various perspectives.

4. **NWPU**: A new public dataset consisting of 5,109 images, with a total of 2,133,375 annotated heads. It is split into three parts: training (3,109 images), evaluation (500 images), and testing (1,500 images).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements.
