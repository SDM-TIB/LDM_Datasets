To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-invasive Self-attention for Side Information Fusion in Sequential Recommendation" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on both public and commercial datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **Section 4.1**, they mention evaluating their methods on the **MovieLens datasets** and a real-world dataset called **APP**. I will take note of the statistics provided for these datasets, such as the number of users, records, and available side information.

In **Table 2**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets:
1. **ML-1m**: Contains 988,129 records with 6,040 users and 165 available side information features (year, genres, rating).
2. **ML-20m**: Contains 19,723,277 records with 138,493 users and 142 available side information features (year, genres, rating).
3. **APP**: Contains 1,774,867 records with 100,000 users and 18 available side information features (category, developer, size, tag).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the original sources of the MovieLens datasets and any other relevant datasets they might have used.

For the **MovieLens datasets**, the citations are typically:
- For **ML-1m**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.
  
- For **ML-20m**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015.

For the **APP dataset**, if the authors do not provide a specific citation, I will note that it is a private dataset collected from a real application store, and thus may not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
