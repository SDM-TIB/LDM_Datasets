To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Plot2Code: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models in Code Generation from Scientific Plots" by Chengyue Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **132 manually selected high-quality matplotlib plots**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset Collection)**, where the authors detail the process of curating their benchmark data. Here, they mention that they collected plots from publicly available matplotlib galleries and filtered them to create a dataset of **132 plot-code pairs**. This section is crucial as it provides specific details about the dataset.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as follows:
- **Plot2Code Dataset**: This dataset consists of 132 matplotlib plots across six plot types, with a total of 293 subplots. Each plot is paired with its corresponding code and a description generated by GPT-4. The dataset is designed to evaluate the code generation capabilities of multi-modal large language models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the Plot2Code dataset itself, but they do mention that all data involved with Plot2Code is available at a specific URL: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Plot2Code. This URL serves as the primary reference for accessing the dataset.

Since the dataset is not attributed to a specific paper but is hosted on Hugging Face, I will note that in the citation. The citation for the dataset will be as follows:

- **Plot2Code Dataset**:
  > Wu, C., Ge, Y., Guo, Q., Wang, J., Liang, Z., Lu, Z., Shan, Y., & Luo, P. (2024). *Plot2Code: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Multi-modal Large Language Models in Code Generation from Scientific Plots*. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TencentARC/Plot2Code.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly documented.
