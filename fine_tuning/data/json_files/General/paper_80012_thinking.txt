To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BASIC LEVEL CATEGORIZATION FACILITATES VISUAL OBJECT RECOGNITION" by Panqu Wang and Garrison W. Cottrell, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to the **ILSVRC 2012 dataset**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Choosing the Basic Level Categories"**. Here, the authors describe how they selected basic level categories from the **ImageNet ILSVRC 2012 dataset**. They mention that this dataset contains 1860 object categories and that they specifically trained on 308 basic level categories derived from it.

Additionally, in the **results section**, the authors discuss their experiments using the **Caltech-101** and **Caltech-256 datasets** to evaluate the generalization power of their learned features. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **references section**:

1. **ILSVRC 2012 Dataset**:
   > Russakovsky, Olga, Deng, Jia, Su, Hao, Krause, Jonathan, Satheesh, Sanjeev, Ma, Sean, Huang, Zhiheng, Karpathy, Andrej, Khosla, Aditya, Bernstein, Michael, Berg, Alexander C., and Fei-Fei, Li. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), pp. 1–42, April 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

2. **Caltech-101 Dataset**:
   > Fei-Fei, Li, Fergus, Rob, and Perona, Pietro. *Learning generative visual models from few training examples: An incremental bayesian approach tested on 101 object categories*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, 106(1):59–70, 2007.

3. **Caltech-256 Dataset**:
   > Griffin, Gregory, Holub, Alex, and Perona, Pietro. *Caltech-256 object category dataset*. 2007.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their proper citations accurately.
