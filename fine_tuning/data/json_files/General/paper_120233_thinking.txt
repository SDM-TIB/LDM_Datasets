To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simplicity Bias Leads to Amplified Performance Disparities" by Samuel J. Bell and Levent Sagun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on performance disparities and may hint at specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **background and related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are foundational to their research. This section often includes discussions of previous studies that may have utilized specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. The authors mention two specific datasets: 

1. **FairFace**: This dataset is described as a collection of human face images annotated with perceived age, race, and gender, aimed at fairness research. The authors note that it is a subset of the YFCC-100M Flickr dataset.

2. **Dollar Street**: This dataset consists of images representing a wide range of household incomes, used for an object classification task. The authors mention that it includes 23,724 RGB images associated with various class labels.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FairFace**, the citation is:
  > Kimmo Karkkainen and Jungseock Joo. 2021. FairFace: Face Attribute Dataset for Balanced Race, Gender, and Age for Bias Measurement and Mitigation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). 1548â€“1558.

- For **Dollar Street**, the citation is:
  > Gapminder. 2016. Dollar Street. https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the necessary information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
