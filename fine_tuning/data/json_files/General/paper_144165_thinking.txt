To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DecomCAM: Advancing Beyond Saliency Maps through Decomposition and Integration" by Yuguang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on six benchmarks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.2 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset mentioned and note down their descriptions.

The datasets listed in this section are:

1. **ImageNet-v2**: This dataset is an extension of the original ImageNet, incorporating additional positional annotations for the original 1000-class ImageNet. The authors utilize all 10,000 images from its train-fullsup set for analysis.

2. **MSCOCO 2017**: A multi-object detection dataset characterized by images with multiple objects of varying sizes and spatial positions. The authors employ the entire validation set, which includes 5,000 images.

3. **PartImageNet**: An extension of ImageNet that provides additional locating annotations for body parts of selected images. The authors utilize the full suite of 4,598 images from the test set.

4. **PS-ImageNet**: A performance-stratified ImageNet subset created by the authors for causal interpretation evaluation, consisting of 10,000 images organized into ten subsets based on class-level performance.

5. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset provides 20 visual object classes in realistic scenes. The authors use the full suite of 5823 images from its validation set.

6. **PASCAL-Part**: An enriched version of the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset with detailed annotations for body parts across various objects. The authors incorporate all 4,737 training images from this dataset for analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
