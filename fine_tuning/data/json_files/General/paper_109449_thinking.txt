To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STEMM: Self-learning with Speech-text Manifold Mixup for Speech Translation" by Qingkai Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MuST-C speech translation benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of speech-to-text translation and mentions the use of the MuST-C dataset, reinforcing its importance.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, I will look for a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, the authors provide statistics about the MuST-C dataset, stating that it contains at least 385 hours of audio recordings from TED Talks, along with manual transcriptions and translations in multiple languages. This section also mentions the use of external machine translation datasets from WMT and OPUS100 for pretraining.

The datasets mentioned in the experiments section are:

1. **MuST-C Dataset**: A multilingual speech translation dataset containing audio recordings, transcriptions, and translations in eight languages. It is noted for its size and the quality of its data.

2. **WMT Datasets**: These datasets are used for machine translation tasks and include various language pairs. The authors mention specific datasets for different language pairs, such as WMT16 and WMT14.

3. **OPUS100**: This dataset is also referenced for its use in machine translation tasks, specifically for certain language pairs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations I need to find are:

- For the **MuST-C Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mattia A. Di Gangi, Roldano Cattoni, Luisa Bentivogli, Matteo Negri, and Marco Turchi. *MuST-C: a Multilingual Speech Translation Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 2012–2017, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **WMT Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Various authors. *WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation)*. Various years. Available at: http://www.statmt.org/wmt/.

- For the **OPUS100**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
