To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recovering Latent Signals from a Mixture of Measurements using a Gaussian Process Prior" by Felipe Tobar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to get an overview of the paper's focus and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions validating the proposed model on three signals: a smooth synthetic signal, a real-world heart-rate time series, and a step function. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific details.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to find more detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention three datasets used for validation:

1. **Smooth Synthetic Signal**: This dataset is generated by a Gaussian process with a square exponential covariance kernel. It is a synthetic dataset used to demonstrate the model's performance.

2. **Heart-Rate Time Series**: The authors state that they used a heart-rate time series from the MIT-BIH Database. This is a real-world dataset that consists of heart-rate measurements, which they constructed a lower-resolution version of for their experiments.

3. **Heaviside Step Function**: This dataset is used to test the model's ability to recover discontinuous signals. It is not a standard dataset but rather a mathematical function used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **MIT-BIH Database**, the citation is:
  > Goldberger, A. L., & Rigney, D. R. (1991). Theory of Heart: Biomechanics, Biophysics, and Nonlinear Dynamics of Cardiac Function. In Nonlinear dynamics at the bedside (pp. 583â€“605). Springer-Verlag, New York.

The smooth synthetic signal and Heaviside step function do not have specific citations as they are generated or defined within the context of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the heart-rate time series dataset while noting that the other two datasets are defined within the paper itself. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
