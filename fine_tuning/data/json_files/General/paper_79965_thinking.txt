To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast model selection by limiting SVM training times" by Aydın Demircioğlu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the efficiency of SVM training and mentions "large scale benchmark data sets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **arthrosis**
2. **aXa**
3. **cod-rna**
4. **covtype**
5. **ijcnn1**
6. **mnist**
7. **poker**
8. **protein**
9. **shuttle**
10. **spektren**
11. **vehicle**
12. **wXa**

I will note the context in which these datasets are used, as the authors aim to compare their model selection procedure against a baseline method using these datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have specific citations provided in the paper. In such cases, I will look for authoritative sources or original papers that introduced these datasets. Here are the citations I can find for some of the datasets:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- **COVTYPE Dataset**: 
  > Andrew Frank and Andreas Asuncion. *UCI Machine Learning Repository - Covertype Dataset*. 2010. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype

- **IJCNN1 Dataset**: 
  > Thorsten Joachims. *Making Large-Scale SVM Learning Practical*. In Advances in Kernel Methods - Support Vector Learning, 1999. Available at: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/joachims99making.pdf

For the other datasets, I will need to look up their respective sources to provide accurate citations. 

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be useful for further studies or applications in the field of machine learning.
