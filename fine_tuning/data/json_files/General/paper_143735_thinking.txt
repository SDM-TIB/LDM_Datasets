To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging Operator Learning and Conditioned Neural Fields: A Unifying Perspective" by Sifan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the benchmarks and datasets used. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments on three benchmarks: the **Advection of Discontinuous Waveforms**, **Shallow-Water Equations**, and **Navier-Stokes Equations**. Each of these benchmarks likely has associated datasets that need to be documented.

1. **Advection of Discontinuous Waveforms**: The authors mention using a dataset established by Hoop et al. (2022), which consists of 40,000 samples of discretized initial conditions on a grid of 200 points. I will note this dataset and its citation.

2. **Shallow-Water Equations**: The dataset for this benchmark is generated by PDEArena, which contains 6,600 trajectories with a spatial resolution of 192x96. I will document this dataset along with the reference to PDEArena.

3. **Navier-Stokes Equations**: Similar to the shallow-water equations, this dataset is also generated by PDEArena, consisting of 7,900 trajectories with a spatial resolution of 128x128. I will include this dataset and its source.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations will be crucial for accurately documenting the datasets.

- For the **Advection of Discontinuous Waveforms**, the citation is:
  > Maarten V de Hoop, Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Elizabeth Qian, and Andrew M Stuart. *The cost-accuracy trade-off in operator learning with neural networks*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.13181, 2022.

- For the **Shallow-Water Equations** dataset, the citation is:
  > Jayesh K Gupta and Johannes Brandstetter. *Towards multi-spatiotemporal-scale generalized PDE modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.15616, 2022.

- For the **Navier-Stokes Equations** dataset, the citation is:
  > Zhongkai Hao, Chang Su, Songming Liu, Julius Berner, Chengyang Ying, Hang Su, Anima Anandkumar, Jian Song, and Jun Zhu. *DPOT: Auto-regressive denoising operator transformer for large-scale PDE pre-training*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03542, 2024.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
