To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Machine Learning Dataset of Bulldog Nostril Images for Stenosis Degree Classification" by Gabriel Toshio Hirokawa Higa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a new annotated dataset composed of 190 images of bulldogs’ nostrils, which is a strong indication that a dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of images taken from 95 brachycephalic French Bulldogs, with three degrees of stenosis (mild, moderate, and severe) represented, along with a small number of non-stenotic images. This section confirms the dataset's composition and its significance in the context of the research.

The authors also mention that the dataset is publicly available, which is crucial for its accessibility. I will note the total number of images and their distribution across the different classes, as this information is relevant for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is newly introduced in this paper, it may not have a separate citation but will be referenced as part of the paper itself. Therefore, I will use the full citation of the paper as the authoritative source for the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Gabriel Toshio Hirokawa Higa, Joyce Katiuccia Medeiros Ramos Carvalho, Paolo Brito Pascoalini Zanoni, Gisele Braziliano de Andrade, Hemerson Pistori. *A New Machine Learning Dataset of Bulldog Nostril Images for Stenosis Degree Classification*. Preprint submitted to Expert Systems with Applications, March 13, 2024.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Dataset Name**: Bulldog Nostril Images Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset composed of 190 images of bulldogs’ nostrils, annotated for three degrees of stenosis (mild, moderate, severe) and a small number of non-stenotic images.
   - **Citation**: Gabriel Toshio Hirokawa Higa, Joyce Katiuccia Medeiros Ramos Carvalho, Paolo Brito Pascoalini Zanoni, Gisele Braziliano de Andrade, Hemerson Pistori. *A New Machine Learning Dataset of Bulldog Nostril Images for Stenosis Degree Classification*. Preprint submitted to Expert Systems with Applications, March 13, 2024.

Now, I will compile this information into the required format for further processing.
