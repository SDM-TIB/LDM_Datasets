To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Overfitting in Deep Networks by Decorrelating Representations" by Michael Cogswell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across a range of datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets explicitly:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, but with 100 classes containing 600 images each, totaling 60,000 images.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > LeCun, Yann, Jackel, L.D., Bottou, L., Brunot, A., Cortes, C., Denker, J.S., Drucker, H., Guyon, I., Muller, U.A., Sackinger, E., et al. *Comparison of learning algorithms for handwritten digit recognition*. In International conference on artificial neural networks, volume 60, pp. 53â€“60, 1995.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Krizhevsky, Alex and Hinton, Geoffrey. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 1(4):7, 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Krizhevsky, Alex and Hinton, Geoffrey. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep, 1(4):7, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
