To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MicroNet: Improving Image Recognition with Extremely Low FLOPs" by Yunsheng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on ImageNet classification, which suggests that ImageNet is a dataset of interest. 

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on three tasks: image classification, object detection, and keypoint detection. They specifically mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for image classification, which is a well-known dataset in the field.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss their evaluation on COCO for object detection and keypoint detection tasks. Therefore, I will also extract the citation for the COCO dataset from the references.

The citation for the COCO dataset is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

Now, I have identified two datasets used in the paper: **ImageNet** and **COCO**. I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
