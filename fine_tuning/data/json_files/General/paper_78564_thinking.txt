To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Dropout Sparsifies Deep Neural Networks" by Dmitry Molchanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for training and evaluating their proposed method. I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, along with details such as the number of samples, types of tasks (e.g., classification), and any specific configurations or splits used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which is typically:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If they mention another dataset, such as **CIFAR-10**, I would find its citation, which might be:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further processing.
