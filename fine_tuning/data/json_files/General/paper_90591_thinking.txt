To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Effect of Dropping Layers of Pre-trained Transformer Models" by Hassan Sajjad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses evaluating the effects of pruning on downstream GLUE tasks, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They refer to the **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE)** benchmark, which is a collection of various NLP tasks. The paper provides a table (Table 1) that lists the specific tasks and their corresponding datasets, including:

1. **SST-2**: Sentiment analysis dataset with 67,349 training instances.
2. **MRPC**: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus with 3,668 training instances.
3. **MNLI**: Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset with 392,702 training instances.
4. **QNLI**: Question Natural Language Inference dataset with 104,743 training instances.
5. **QQP**: Quora Question Pairs dataset.
6. **RTE**: Recognizing Textual Entailment dataset.
7. **STS-B**: Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark with 36,384 training instances.

I will also note the specific statistics provided for each dataset, as they are important for understanding the context of the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the GLUE benchmark are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
