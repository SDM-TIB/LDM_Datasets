To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Should I try multiple optimizers when fine-tuning pre-trained Transformers for NLP tasks?" by Nefeli Gkouti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with **five GLUE datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they experimented with five tasks from GLUE, which include:

1. **SST-2**: A binary sentiment classification dataset with 68.8k sentences from movie reviews.
2. **MRPC**: A dataset containing 5.8k sentence pairs classified as paraphrases or not.
3. **CoLA**: A dataset with 9.6k word sequences labeled for grammatical correctness.
4. **STS-B**: A dataset with 7.2k sentence pairs annotated with similarity scores.
5. **MNLI**: A dataset containing 393k premise-hypothesis pairs for natural language inference.

In the **evaluation measures section**, the authors describe the metrics used for each dataset, confirming their relevance and the specific tasks they address.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
