To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recovering the Imperfect: Cell Segmentation in the Presence of Dynamically Localized Proteins" by ¨Ozg¨un C¸ i¸cek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach on data from human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, which indicates that there is a specific dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates on the experiments conducted with HEK293T cells expressing a fusion protein, suggesting that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their data generation process in the **data and annotation** subsection of the experiments section. They state that the data was generated after transient transfection of HEK293T cells with a construct expressing the fusion protein mCherry-LINuS. This indicates that the dataset consists of images captured during this experiment.

The authors also mention that they trained their model on 82 cropped images from original 1800x1800 images and tested it on 2 full-sized images. They evaluated their propagation algorithm on an unseen video with 35 full-sized frames containing 117 cells annotated by experts. This provides specific details about the dataset used for training and evaluation.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset and look for full citations in the **references section**. However, since the dataset appears to be generated specifically for this study and does not reference an external dataset, I will note that the dataset is unique to this research.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **HEK293T Cell Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells expressing the fusion protein mCherry-LINuS, captured using a ZEISS LSM780 confocal microscope. The dataset includes 82 cropped images used for training and 2 full-sized images for testing, along with an unseen video containing 35 frames annotated by experts.

Since there are no external citations for this dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset generated by the authors for their specific experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
