To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One-for-All: Bridge the Gap Between Heterogeneous Architectures in Knowledge Distillation" by Zhiwei Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet-1K** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples, with images of size 32x32 pixels. It is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

2. **ImageNet-1K**: This is a larger dataset containing 1.2 million training samples and 50,000 validation samples, with images of size 224x224 pixels. It is widely used in the field of computer vision for benchmarking models.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application of this research.
