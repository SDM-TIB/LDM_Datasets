To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ProTIP: Probabilistic Robustness Verification on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models against Stochastic Perturbation" by Yi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that detail the methodology or experimental setup, as these sections typically outline the datasets used for validation or testing. 

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MS-COCO dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of the ProTIP framework.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the dataset. The MS-COCO dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, particularly for tasks like image captioning and object detection. I will ensure to note its characteristics, such as the number of images and the types of annotations it includes.

Next, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation for the MS-COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. Avidan, Peter Doll√°r, Zhuowen Tu, and Alan L. Yuille. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a clear format that can be used for further analysis or reference, ensuring that the dataset entries are complete and accurate.
