To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Deep Joint Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization Framework for Identifying the Common and Subject-specific Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech" by Jonghye Woo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology section typically details how the datasets were collected or generated.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using "in vivo tongue motion data" and "simulated datasets" for their experiments. This indicates that there are at least two types of datasets involved: one derived from real subjects and another from simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe the data collection process. The authors state that they used "T2-weighted 2D tagged and cine MRI" to acquire data from 18 healthy speakers. This suggests that the dataset consists of MRI data capturing tongue motion during speech.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their method using both synthetic and in vivo datasets. They mention specific datasets used for validation, including "2D plus time and 3D plus time synthetic motion data" and "in vivo tongue motion data obtained by tagged MRI."

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets:

1. **In Vivo Tongue Motion Dataset**: This dataset consists of MRI data collected from 18 healthy speakers performing a speech task. The data includes T2-weighted 2D tagged and cine MRI images.

2. **Synthetic Tongue Motion Datasets**: These datasets are generated using a tongue motion simulator based on a vocal tract atlas. They include 2D and 3D displacement fields that simulate tongue movements during speech.

Next, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned in the references section of the paper. The authors refer to several foundational works related to the methodologies they employed, which may include citations for the datasets.

For the **In Vivo Tongue Motion Dataset**, the citation is:
> Woo, J., Prince, J.L., Stone, M., Xing, F., Gomez, A.D., Green, J.R., Hartnick, C.J., Brady, T.J., Reese, T.G., Wedeen, V.J., et al. (2019). A sparse non-negative matrix factorization framework for identifying functional units of tongue behavior from MRI. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 38(4), 730-740.

For the **Synthetic Tongue Motion Datasets**, the citation is:
> Woo, J., Lee, J., Murano, E.Z., Xing, F., Al-Talib, M., Stone, M., Prince, J.L. (2015). A high-resolution atlas and statistical model of the vocal tract from structural MRI. *Computer Methods in Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering: Imaging & Visualization*, 3(1), 47-60.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
