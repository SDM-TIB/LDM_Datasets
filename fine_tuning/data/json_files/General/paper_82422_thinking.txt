To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Feature Learning Architecture with Multi-clustering Integration RBM" by Jielei Chu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed architecture is evaluated on the **Microsoft Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM) 2.0 dataset**, indicating that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **experiments sections** for any additional datasets. In the introduction, the authors discuss the architecture's performance but do not mention other datasets explicitly. However, in the **experiments section**, they refer to **fifteen real-valued image datasets** used for evaluation, which are summarized in **Table II**.

I will then look closely at **Table II** to extract the names and details of these datasets. The table lists the following datasets along with their respective classes and instances:

1. **alphabet**: 3 classes, 814 instances
2. **americanflag**: 3 classes, 873 instances
3. **aquarium**: 3 classes, 922 instances
4. **baobab**: 3 classes, 900 instances
5. **bathroom**: 3 classes, 924 instances
6. **beret**: 3 classes, 876 instances
7. **birthdaycake**: 3 classes, 932 instances
8. **blog**: 3 classes, 943 instances
9. **blood**: 3 classes, 866 instances
10. **boat**: 3 classes, 857 instances
11. **boomerang**: 3 classes, 910 instances
12. **building**: 3 classes, 911 instances
13. **wallpaper**: 3 classes, 919 instances
14. **weapon**: 3 classes, 858 instances
15. **weddingdress**: 3 classes, 883 instances

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The paper cites the **Microsoft Research Asia Multimedia (MSRA-MM) 2.0 dataset** as follows:

- For the MSRA-MM 2.0 dataset:
  > H. Li, M. Wang, and X.-S. Hua. *Msra-mm 2.0: A large-scale web multimedia dataset*. In IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, pages 164â€“169, 2009.

The other datasets listed in Table II do not have specific citations provided in the paper, which is common for datasets that are widely used or publicly available. However, I will note that they are part of the experimental setup.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MSRA-MM dataset and a note for the other datasets indicating their common use in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
