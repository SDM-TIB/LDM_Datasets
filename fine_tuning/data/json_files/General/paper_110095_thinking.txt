To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Influence of Color Spaces for Deep Learning Image Colorization" by Coloma Ballester et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on colorization methods and may hint at specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Related Work)**, where the authors discuss various colorization methods and may list datasets traditionally used in the literature. I will look for any tables or lists that summarize datasets, as these often contain valuable information.

In **section 2.3 (Datasets used in Literature)**, the authors summarize the datasets utilized in previous studies. Here, I will find specific mentions of datasets along with their characteristics. For example, they mention the **COCO dataset**, which contains various natural images and is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, the citation for the **COCO dataset** is:
> Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755.

Additionally, I will look for other datasets mentioned, such as **ImageNet** and **DIV2K**, and retrieve their citations as well.

Once I have identified all datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is comprehensive and useful for future reference.

Finally, I will review the entire process to ensure that no datasets have been overlooked and that all citations are accurate and complete.
