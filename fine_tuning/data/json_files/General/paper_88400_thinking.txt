To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity Document to Selfie Face Matching Across Adolescence" by Vítor Albiero et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors reference a private dataset called the **Chilean Young Adult (CHIYA) dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors provide context about the CHIYA dataset. They mention that it consists of 263,490 image pairs, which is significant information. I will note this down as it helps in understanding the dataset's scale and purpose.

In the **experimental dataset section**, the authors elaborate on the CHIYA dataset, describing its composition and the methodology used to collect the images. They explain that each pair consists of a national ID card image and a selfie taken at a later age. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure, including the number of subjects and images, which I will document.

Additionally, I will check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors reference several datasets, including:

1. **In the Wild Celebrity Children (ITWCC) dataset**: Assembled by Ricanek et al. for evaluating face matchers across different ages.
   - Citation: K. Ricanek, S. Bhardwaj, and M. Sodomsky. *A Review of Face Recognition Against Longitudinal Child Faces*. In A. Brömme et al., editors, BIOSIG 2015, pages 15–26, Bonn, 2015.

2. **Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers (NITL) dataset**: Used by Best-Rowden et al. to study age variation effects on face recognition.
   - Citation: L. Best-Rowden, Y. Hoole, and A. K. Jain. *Automatic Face Recognition of Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers: A Longitudinal Evaluation*. In A. Brömme et al., editors, Biosig 2016, pages 87–98, Bonn, 2016.

3. **Children Longitudinal Face (CLF) dataset**: Investigated by Deb et al. for age differences in face recognition accuracy.
   - Citation: D. Deb, N. Nain, and A. K. Jain. *Longitudinal Study of Child Face Recognition*. In International Conference on Biometrics ICB, Feb 2018.

4. **Public-IvS dataset**: Mentioned as a dataset used for comparison with their proposed method.
   - Citation: X. Zhu et al. *Large-scale bisample learning on id versus spot face recognition*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper referencing. I will compile the details of the CHIYA dataset and the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I include the context in which they were used in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
