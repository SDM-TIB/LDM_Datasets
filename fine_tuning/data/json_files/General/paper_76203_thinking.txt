To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithmic Regularization in Learning Deep Homogeneous Models: Layers are Automatically Balanced" by Simon S. Du, Wei Hu, and Jason D. Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will format this information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review, while ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
