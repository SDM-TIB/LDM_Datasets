To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling Target-Side Morphology in Neural Machine Translation: A Comparison of Strategies" by Marion Weller-Di Marco, Matthias Huck, and Alexander Fraser, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges in machine translation related to morphologically rich languages, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Empirical evaluation: Machine translation experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using three different training corpus conditions: small, medium, and large. I will look for specific dataset names associated with these conditions.

In this section, the authors specify the datasets used:
1. **News Commentary Dataset**: This dataset is used for the small corpus, consisting of 248,730 parallel sentences.
2. **Europarl Dataset**: This dataset is combined with the news-commentary corpus for the large corpus, which contains 1,956,444 parallel sentences.
3. **WMT’15 and WMT’16 Newstest Sets**: These are used as development and test sets for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **News Commentary Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
