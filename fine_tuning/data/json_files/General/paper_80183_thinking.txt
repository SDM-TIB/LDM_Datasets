To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Training Deep Neural Networks with Low Precision Multiplications" by Matthieu Courbariaux, Jean-Pierre David, and Yoshua Bengio, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors trained neural networks on three benchmark datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **SVHN**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this case, **section 8 (Baseline Results)** provides an overview of the datasets used, including their dimensions, labels, and the number of training and test samples. The table in this section summarizes the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each image is 28x28 pixels (784 dimensions) and has 10 labels (digits 0-9).

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 32x32 color images, also with 10 labels (10 different classes).

3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which consists of 604,000 training samples and 26,000 test samples, also represented as 32x32 color images with 10 labels.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
