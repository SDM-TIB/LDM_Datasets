To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transductive Zero-Shot Learning for 3D Point Cloud Classification" by Ali Cheraghian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on, which are:

1. **ModelNet10**: This dataset is mentioned as having 10 classes and is used for zero-shot learning tasks. The authors refer to it in the context of their experiments.

2. **ModelNet40**: This dataset contains 40 classes and is also used in their experiments. The authors specify that it is a larger version of ModelNet10.

3. **McGill**: This dataset is noted to have 19 classes and is included in their evaluation.

4. **SHREC2015**: This dataset has 50 classes and is mentioned as part of their experimental setup.

Additionally, the authors reference two 2D datasets:

5. **AwA2**: This dataset is used for zero-shot learning and has 50 classes, with both standard and proposed splits mentioned.

6. **CUB**: This dataset, which is also used for zero-shot learning, has 200 classes and is referenced in the context of their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
