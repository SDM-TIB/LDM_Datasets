To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Joint Wireless-Optical Front-haul Solution for Multi-user Massive MIMO 5G RAN" by Son T. Le et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experimental setup, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of deploying C-RAN for 5G networks and mention the eCPRI protocol but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experimental setup** section, where the authors describe their methodology in detail.

In the **experimental setup**, they mention generating multi-user 5G-compliant signals through offline digital signal processing (DSP) and modeling the uplink scenario based on the **3GPP 3D Urban Micro deployment**. This indicates that they are using a specific channel model, but it does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

Next, I will check the **experimental results and discussions** section. Here, the authors present various performance metrics and results based on the number of users and received SNR values. However, they do not reference any publicly available datasets or specific data collections used for their experiments.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and technologies related to mobile fronthaul and MIMO systems, but they do not explicitly mention datasets that can be extracted.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned that can be extracted or cited. The authors focus on theoretical and experimental results without referencing any publicly available datasets.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. This process highlights the importance of carefully examining each section of the paper to ensure that all potential datasets are identified, even if they are not explicitly labeled as such.
