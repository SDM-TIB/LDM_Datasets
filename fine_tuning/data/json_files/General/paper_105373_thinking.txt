To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cortical representations of Auditory Perception using Graph Independent Component Analysis on EEG" by Pranav Sankhe and Ritik Madan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on EEG data related to music perception, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, specifically the **Dataset subsection**. Here, the authors explicitly mention using the **Stanford’s NMED-T dataset**. They describe the dataset as containing cortical (EEG) and behavioral data collected during natural music listening, recorded from 20 adult participants while they listened to 10 full-length songs. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including the number of participants, the nature of the data, and the context in which it was collected.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Stanford’s NMED-T dataset. The authors cite the dataset as being collected by Kaneshiro et al. (2017). I will look for the complete reference to this work to ensure I have the full citation.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the dataset:
> Kaneshiro, N. K., et al. (2017). *The NMED-T dataset: A naturalistic music listening dataset for EEG analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 1-5.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify the dataset**: The paper mentions the **Stanford’s NMED-T dataset** in the method section.
2. **Extract details**: The dataset includes EEG and behavioral data from 20 participants listening to 10 songs, with a sampling rate of 125Hz.
3. **Find the citation**: The dataset is cited as being collected by Kaneshiro et al. (2017).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
