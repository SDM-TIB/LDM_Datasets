To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting recovery following stroke: deep learning, multimodal data and feature selection using explainable AI" by Adam White et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates data from the **PLORAS study**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods and Materials section**, specifically subsection 2.1 (Dataset), where the authors describe the participants and the data collected. They mention that the dataset consists of MRI scans and associated tabular data from **758 stroke survivors**. This is a significant dataset for the study.

In subsection 2.1.1, the authors describe the **Stitched MRI dataset**, which consists of 2D images created from MRI scans. This dataset is essential for their experiments.

In subsection 2.1.2, they introduce the **Grey Matter Regions of Interest (GM-ROI) dataset**, which is derived from the original MRI images and focuses on specific anatomical regions relevant to the study.

In subsection 2.1.5, the authors mention the **White Matter Regions of Interest (WM-ROI) dataset**, which is also derived from the MRI scans and focuses on white matter tracts.

In subsection 2.1.6, they describe the **Hybrid White Matter Tracts dataset**, which combines the WM-ROI dataset with tabular features.

Throughout the paper, the authors refer to the **PLORAS database** multiple times, which is a key dataset for their analysis. The full citation for this dataset is provided in the references section.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for further processing or review.
