To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Your Model Sensitive? SPeDaC: A New Resource and Benchmark for Training Sensitive Personal Data Classifiers" by Gaia Gambarelli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **SPeDaC**, a new annotated resource for identifying sensitive personal data categories, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Models)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they introduce **SPeDaC1**, **SPeDaC2**, and **SPeDaC3**:

1. **SPeDaC1**: This dataset contains 10,675 sentences labeled for sensitive and non-sensitive content. It is designed for binary classification tasks.

2. **SPeDaC2**: This dataset consists of 5,133 sentences that categorize sensitive sentences into five macro-categories of personal data. 

3. **SPeDaC3**: This dataset includes fine-grained categories with 61 labels, aimed at identifying specific types of sensitive personal data.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for various classification tasks, further validating their significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since SPeDaC is a newly introduced resource by the authors themselves, it may not have an external citation yet. Instead, I will note the authors and the paper title as the primary source for the datasets.

The citation for the SPeDaC datasets is:
> Gambarelli, G., Gangemi, A., & Tripodi, R. (2022). *Is Your Model Sensitive? SPeDaC: A New Resource and Benchmark for Training Sensitive Personal Data Classifiers*. Preprint.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference.
