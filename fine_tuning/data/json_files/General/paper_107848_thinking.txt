To extract datasets from the research paper titled "One Student Knows All Experts Know: From Sparse to Dense" by Fuzhao Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **ImageNet** and **Cifar10**, which indicates that these are likely datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they explicitly state that they use **ImageNet** and **Cifar10** for their evaluations. 

1. **ImageNet**: The paper describes it as a widely-used image classification benchmark with 1,000 classes and 1.3 million images. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of computer vision models.

2. **Cifar10**: This dataset is mentioned as another benchmark for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. It is commonly used for evaluating machine learning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **Cifar10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
