To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SILT: Shadow-aware Iterative Label Tuning for Learning to Detect Shadows from Noisy Labels" by Han Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SBU Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,089 training images and 638 testing images. It is noted for having noisy labels, which is a central theme of the paper.

2. **UCF Shadow Dataset**: This dataset includes 360 images. It is also mentioned in the context of noisy labels.

3. **ISTD Dataset**: This dataset has 1,330 training images and 540 testing images. The authors describe it as relatively cleaner compared to the other datasets.

In the same section, the authors discuss the relabeling of the SBU test set to improve evaluation accuracy, which is an important detail that highlights the dataset's significance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SBU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tomás F. Yago Vicente, Le Hou, Chen-Ping Yu, Minh Hoai, and Dimitris Samaras. *Large-scale training of shadow detectors with noisily-annotated shadow examples*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 816–832, 2016.

- For the **UCF Shadow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jiejie Zhu, Kegan G.G. Samuel, Syed Z. Masood, and Marshall F. Tappen. *Learning to recognize shadows in monochromatic natural images*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 223–230, 2010.

- For the **ISTD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jifeng Wang, Xiang Li, and Jian Yang. *Stacked conditional generative adversarial networks for jointly learning shadow detection and shadow removal*. In IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1788–1797, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
