To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Train Where the Data is: A Case for Bandwidth Efficient Coded Training" by Zhifeng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of training machine learning models on mobile devices and hints at the use of datasets for experiments, but does not specify any particular datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors describe their evaluation setup. Here, they mention using datasets from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** for their experiments with Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors do not provide specific names of datasets but refer to the UCI repository. Therefore, I will need to look up the specific dataset used in their experiments. The reference to the UCI Machine Learning Repository is crucial, as it is a well-known source for various datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The citation is as follows:
> Lichman, M. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2013. URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Since the paper does not specify which dataset from the UCI repository was used, I will note that the authors utilized datasets from this repository for their experiments, but I will not be able to provide a specific dataset name without further details.

In summary, I will create an entry for the dataset based on the information gathered:

1. **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: The authors used datasets from this repository for their experiments with Logistic Regression and SVM.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the full citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing complete citations for datasets used in research.
