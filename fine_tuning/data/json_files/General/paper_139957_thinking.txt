To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brand Visibility in Packaging: A Deep Learning Approach for Logo Detection, Saliency-Map Prediction, and Logo Placement Analysis" by Alireza Hosseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors leverage YOLOv8 for logo detection across two prominent datasets, **FoodLogoDet-1500** and **LogoDet-3K**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Logo Detection)**, where the authors provide a detailed summary of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **FoodLogoDet-1500**: This dataset contains 145,400 images with 194,261 objects and 1,500 logos. It is specifically designed for food logo detection tasks.

2. **LogoDet-3K**: This dataset consists of 99,768 images, 158,652 objects, and 3,000 logos. It is another significant dataset for logo detection.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed utilized for the experiments, which they are.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FoodLogoDet-1500**, the citation is:
  > Hou, Q., Min, W., Wang, J., Hou, S., Zheng, Y., Jiang, S. (2021). *FoodLogoDet-1500: A dataset for large-scale food logo detection via multi-scale feature decoupling network*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 4670–4679.

- For **LogoDet-3K**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Min, W., Hou, S., Ma, S., Zheng, Y., Jiang, S. (2022). *LogoDet3K: A large-scale image dataset for logo detection*. ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications, 18(1), 1–19.

Next, I will also check for the **SalECI dataset** mentioned in section 4.2.1, which is used for saliency map prediction. The authors describe it as comprising 972 e-commerce images paired with fixation maps and text boundaries. The citation for this dataset is:
> Jiang, L., Li, Y., Li, S., Xu, M., Lei, S., Guo, Y., Huang, B. (2022). *Does text attract attention on e-commerce images: A novel saliency prediction dataset and method*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2088–2097.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
