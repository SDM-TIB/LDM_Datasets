To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Convex Optimization with Many Non-Linear Constraints" by Joachim Giesen and SÃ¶ren Laue, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In this paper, the authors discuss their implementation and testing on the **robust SVM problem**. I will check if they mention any specific datasets used for this problem, including details about their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe generating random datasets for their experiments. They mention that the feature vectors were sampled from a uniform distribution and that the covariance matrices were randomly chosen from the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation, as the data is generated rather than sourced from an existing dataset.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets, I will note that the datasets used are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the experiments. I will also ensure to mention that no external dataset citations are provided in the references section.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring to include any relevant details about the datasets, even if they are not traditional datasets with citations. This will help in documenting the datasets used in the research comprehensively.

In summary, I will extract the following information:
- **Dataset Name**: Synthetic dataset for robust SVM problem
- **Description**: Generated from a uniform distribution with positive semidefinite covariance matrices.
- **Citation**: No external dataset citation available, as the data is synthetically generated.

This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
