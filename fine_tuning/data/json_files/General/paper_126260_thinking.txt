To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Edit: Fault-Aware Code Editor for Code Generation" by Kechi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors performed extensive evaluations across two competitive programming datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in competitive programming tasks. They mention the use of two public competitive programming benchmarks: **APPS** and **HumanEval**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They describe the **APPS dataset** as a collection of 5000 training and 5000 test tasks collected from coding competitions and interview problems. They also mention that the test set has three different difficulty levels: Introductory, Interview, and Competition. The **HumanEval dataset** is described as a set of 164 test programming problems with function signatures, docstrings, bodies, and several unit tests.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **APPS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Saurav Kadavath, Mantas Mazeika, Akul Arora, Ethan Guo, Collin Burns, Samir Puranik, Horace He, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring coding challenge competence with APPS*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks 1, NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021, December 2021, virtual.

2. **HumanEval Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mark Chen, Jerry Tworek, Heewoo Jun, Qiming Yuan, Henrique Ponde de Oliveira Pinto, Jared Kaplan, Harrison Edwards, Yuri Burda, Nicholas Joseph, Greg Brockman, Alex Ray, Raul Puri, Gretchen Krueger, Michael Petrov, Heidy Khlaaf, Girish Sastry, Pamela Mishkin, Brooke Chan, Scott Gray, Nick Ryder, Mikhail Pavlov, Alethea Power, Lukasz Kaiser, Mohammad Bavarian, Clemens Winter, Philippe Tillet, Felipe Petroski Such, Dave Cummings, Matthias Plappert, Fotios Chantzis, Eliza-
   > beth Barnes, Ariel Herbert-Voss, William Hebgen Guss, Alex Nichol, Alex Paino, Nikolas Tezak, Jie Tang, Igor Babuschkin, Suchir Balaji, Shantanu Jain, William Saunders, Christopher Hesse, Andrew N. Carr, Jan Leike, Joshua Achiam, Vedant Misra, Evan Morikawa, Alec Radford, Matthew Knight, Miles Brundage, Mira Murati, Katie Mayer, Peter Welinder, Bob McGrew, Dario Amodei, Sam McCandlish, Ilya Sutskever, and Wojciech Zaremba. *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. CoRR, abs/2107.03374.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **APPS Dataset**: A collection of 5000 training and 5000 test tasks for coding challenges.
   - Citation: Dan Hendrycks et al. *Measuring coding challenge competence with APPS*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks 1, NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021, December 2021, virtual.

2. **HumanEval Dataset**: A set of 164 test programming problems with function signatures and unit tests.
   - Citation: Mark Chen et al. *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. CoRR, abs/2107.03374.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
