To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Differentiable RANSAC" by Tong Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **PhotoTourism dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as containing images, intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from a reference COLMAP reconstruction, and pre-detected RootSIFT features. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation of the proposed method.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **ScanNet dataset**, which consists of 1201 scans for training and 312 scans for validation. This dataset is also significant for their experiments, particularly in the context of indoor 3D point cloud registration.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **PhotoTourism dataset**, the citation is:
   > Noah Snavely, Steven M Seitz, and Richard Szeliski. *Photo tourism: exploring photo collections in 3D*. In SIGGRAPH, 2006.

2. For the **ScanNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nie√üner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In CVPR, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
