To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weight and Gradient Centralization in Deep Neural Networks" by Wolfgang Fuhl and Enkelejda Kasneci, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in previous work.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Data sets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically outlines the datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In section 5, the following datasets are mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images, each with a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels, divided into 10 classes. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the validation set has 10,000 images.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 60,000 color images with a resolution of 32 × 32 pixels but is divided into 100 classes. The training set has 500 examples per class, and the validation set has 100 examples per class.

3. **VOC2012**: This dataset is used for detection, classification, and semantic segmentation. The authors specifically mention using the semantic segmentation annotations, which include 1,464 training images and 1,449 validation images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **VOC2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
