To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Generative Self-Supervised Learning for the Assessment of Biological Images with Lack of Annotations: A COVID-19 Case-Study" by Alessio Mascolini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **RxRx19a** dataset, which is a key dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **methods section**. Here, the authors provide a description of the datasets used:

1. **RxRx19a**: This dataset consists of 305,520 fluorescent microscopy images aimed at investigating therapeutic treatments for COVID-19. The images were generated from experiments involving FDA-approved and EMA-approved drugs or compounds in late-stage clinical trials. The dataset is specifically designed for high-throughput screening of compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines.

2. **RxRx1**: This dataset contains 296 GB of 16-bit fluorescent microscopy images created to discern biological variation under controlled conditions. It is used for innovative machine learning and deep learning pipelines aimed at drug discovery and development.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **RxRx19a**, the citation is:
  > Cuccarese, M. F., Earnshaw, B. A., Heiser, K., Fogelson, B., Davis, C. T., McLean, P. F., Gordon, H. B., Skelly, K.-R., Weathersby, F. L., Rodic, V., Quigley, I. K., Pastuzyn, E. D., Mendivil, B. M., Lazar, N. H., Brooks, C. A., Carpenter, J., Jacobson, P., Glazier, S. W., Thomas, K. R., Chong, Y. T., Hegde, S. S., Alfa, R. W., Victors, M. L., Haque, I. S., Low, A. S., & Gibson, C. C. (2020). Functional immune mapping with deep-learning enabled phenomics applied to immunomodulatory and COVID-19 drug discovery. *bioRxiv*.

- For **RxRx1**, the citation is:
  > Heiser, K., McLean, P. F., Davis, C. T., Fogelson, B., Gordon, H. B., Jacobson, P., Hurst, B., Miller, B., Alfa, R. W., Earnshaw, B. A., Victors, M. L., Chong, Y. T., Haque, I. S., Low, A. S., & Gibson, C. C. (2020). Identification of potential treatments for COVID-19 through artificial intelligence-enabled phenomic analysis of human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. *bioRxiv*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset descriptions are clear and that the citations are complete and accurate.
