To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Operator-Theoretic Approach to Robust Event-Triggered Control of Network Systems with Frequency-Domain Uncertainties" by Shiqi Zhang, Yuezu Lv, and Zhongkui Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors include a section that explicitly lists the datasets used for their experiments. If such a section exists, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

If the datasets are not explicitly listed in a dedicated section, I will check the **results or experiments section**. Authors often describe the datasets they used when discussing their experimental setup and results. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset cited.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to conduct a brief search to find the authoritative source for that dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
