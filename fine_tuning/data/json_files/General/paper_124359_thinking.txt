To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Diverse and Coherent Augmentation for Time-Series Forecasting" by Xiyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **five real-world time-series datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive list of datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **ETTh1**: A multivariate time-series dataset used for forecasting tasks.
2. **ETTh2**: Another multivariate time-series dataset, similar in nature to ETTh1.
3. **ETTm1**: A multivariate time-series dataset that is part of the ETT series.
4. **ETTm2**: Another dataset from the ETT series, used for time-series forecasting.
5. **Exchange**: A dataset related to exchange rates, also used for forecasting.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ETTh1** and **ETTh2**, the citation is:
  > Haoyi Zhou, Shanghang Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shuai Zhang, Jianxin Li, Hui Xiong, and Wancai Zhang. *Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021.

- For **ETTm1** and **ETTm2**, the citation is the same as above, as they are part of the same dataset series.

- For the **Exchange** dataset, the citation is:
  > Haixu Wu, Jiehui Xu, Jianmin Wang, and Mingsheng Long. *Autoformer: Decomposition Transformers with Autocorrelation for Long-Term Series Forecasting*. In NeurIPS, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
