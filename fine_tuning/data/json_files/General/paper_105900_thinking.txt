To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subtyping patients with chronic disease using longitudinal BMI patterns" by Md Mozaharul Mottalib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions using a "large and geographically diverse EHR dataset capturing the health status of around two million individuals for a period of six years." This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the subsection titled **Data Processing**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of patients from the athenahealth system, which is a large provider of network-enabled services for hospital and ambulatory clients in the US. They mention that the initial cohort contained 1,997,007 patients with around 14,473,471 visit records, which were filtered down to 1,531,374 patients with sufficient data for BMI trajectory analysis.

The authors also define **18 cohorts** based on the presence of specific chronic diseases, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The diseases include hypothyroidism, stroke, Alzheimerâ€™s, anemia, asthma, heart failure, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic kidney disease, cancer, depression, diabetes, hip fracture, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, arthritis, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

I will also check the **Results** and **Discussion** sections to see if the authors mention any additional datasets or provide further context about the cohorts and their characteristics.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation for the dataset used in the study. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **Athenahealth EHR Dataset**: 
  > Mottalib, M. M., Jones-Smith, J. C., Sheridan, B., & Beheshti, R. (2023). Subtyping patients with chronic disease using longitudinal BMI patterns. *Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics*, XX(X), XXXX-XXXX.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare it for structured output, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
