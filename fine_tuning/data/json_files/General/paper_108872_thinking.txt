To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topic Analysis for Text with Side Data" by Biyi Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the approach is evaluated on "several different datasets," which indicates that there are multiple datasets to identify.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Training Details)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain the specific names and characteristics of the datasets.

In this section, I find the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,000 samples of customer feedback with product characteristics. It is generated based on combinations of product categories and descriptions.

2. **PTS Dataset**: A real-world dataset containing 795 samples of customer feedback and ratings. The comments vary in length, with an average of 10.6 words.

3. **WIP Dataset**: This medium-sized dataset has 3,451 samples, each containing customer feedback and ratings, with an average comment length of 8.9 words.

4. **DCL Dataset**: Another medium-sized dataset with 5,427 samples, where comments can be quite lengthy, averaging 61.7 words.

5. **RR Dataset**: A large dataset from which 10,000 samples were randomly selected. It contains customer feedback with an average comment length of 69.5 words.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily described in the context of the paper and do not have external citations, I will note that the synthetic dataset is publicly available at a specified URL, while the other datasets are proprietary and do not have specific citations.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: Available at [https://github.com/biyifang/nnLDA/blob/main/syn_file.csv](https://github.com/biyifang/nnLDA/blob/main/syn_file.csv).

- **PTS Dataset**: Proprietary dataset, no citation available.

- **WIP Dataset**: Proprietary dataset, no citation available.

- **DCL Dataset**: Proprietary dataset, no citation available.

- **RR Dataset**: Proprietary dataset, no citation available.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I adhere to the importance of providing full citations where applicable.
