To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Adaptive Bayesian Linear Regression for Scalable Bayesian Optimization with Warm Start" by Valerio Perrone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the scalability of Bayesian optimization and mentions the use of multiple tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look into the **Results** section, particularly subsections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, where the authors describe their experiments. In subsection 3.2, they specifically mention using the **OpenML platform**, which contains a variety of datasets for evaluating machine learning algorithms. This indicates that datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the OpenML platform, which is a significant source of datasets. The relevant citation for OpenML is:

- **OpenML**: 
  > J. Vanschoren, J. N. Van Rijn, B. Bischl, and L. Torgo. *OpenML: networked science in machine learning*. ACM SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter, 15(2):49–60, 2014.

Additionally, in subsection 3.3, the authors mention using datasets from **LIBSVM**. The citation for LIBSVM is:

- **LIBSVM**: 
  > C.-C. Chang and C.-J. Lin. *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2:27:1–27:27, 2011.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **OpenML Datasets**: Used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on various machine learning tasks.
2. **LIBSVM Datasets**: Specifically mentioned for tuning feedforward neural networks in the experiments.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation as required. This thorough approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
