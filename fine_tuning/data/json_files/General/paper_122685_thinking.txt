To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model-based feature selection for neural networks: A mixed-integer programming approach" by Shudian Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to numerical results on the **well-known MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets**, indicating that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 3, the authors provide a clear description of both datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten single digits from 0 to 9, containing a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each sample image is a 28 × 28 grayscale image.

2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains Zalando’s article images with 10 categories of clothing, also featuring a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each sample image is similarly a 28 × 28 grayscale image.

The authors emphasize that the MNIST dataset has significantly more "dead" pixels compared to FashionMNIST, which is an important consideration for their feature selection approach.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

- For the **FashionMNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
