To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models for Semantic Monitoring of Corporate Disclosures: A Case Study on Korea’s Top 50 KOSPI Companies" by Junwon Sung et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on the top 50 publicly traded companies listed on the Korean KOSPI, which suggests that there is a dataset related to corporate disclosures.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of large language models for sentiment analysis on corporate announcements, hinting at the existence of a dataset derived from these announcements. 

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically **section 2 (Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset was sourced from the Korea Investor’s Network for Disclosure System (KIND) and includes monthly disclosure summaries for the top 50 KOSPI companies over a period of 17 months, from January 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's scope and the data collection method.

The authors also specify that the dataset consists of sentiment ratings assigned to these disclosures, which further confirms the dataset's relevance to the study.

Now, I will look into the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the Korea Investor’s Network for Disclosure System (KIND), it may not have a traditional citation like a published paper. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on the disclosures from this specific network.

To summarize, I will compile the following information about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: KOSPI Corporate Disclosures Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset containing monthly summaries of corporate disclosures from the top 50 companies listed on the Korean KOSPI, covering a period of 17 months. Each summary is assigned a sentiment rating on a scale from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive).
   - **Source**: Korea Investor’s Network for Disclosure System (KIND).

Since the dataset does not have a traditional citation, I will note the source as the authoritative reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
