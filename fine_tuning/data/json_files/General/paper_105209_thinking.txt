To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequential Modeling with Multiple Attributes for Watchlist Recommendation in E-Commerce" by Uriel Singer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a "large-scale watchlist dataset from eBay," which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized. The introduction further elaborates on the watchlist functionality in e-commerce, but I need to find more details about the dataset itself.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the dataset as being collected from eBay, including specifics such as the number of users, items, and interactions. The dataset includes various attributes like item-ID, user-ID, price, seller-ID, and more.

The authors state that the dataset consists of:
- **40,344 users**
- **5,374,902 items**
- **11,667,759 item page views**
- **1,373,794 watchlist item clicks**

They also mention that the dataset is highly sparse and includes multiple attributes for each item, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from eBay and not a standalone publication, it may not have a formal citation like traditional datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on user interactions from eBay during a specific time frame (February 2021).

To summarize, I will create an entry for the dataset as follows:

1. **eBay Watchlist Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale collection of user interactions with watchlist items on the eBay platform, sampled during the first two weeks of February 2021. It includes various attributes related to items and user interactions.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is based on data collected from eBay, and I will reference the paper itself for context.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their significance in the context of the research.
