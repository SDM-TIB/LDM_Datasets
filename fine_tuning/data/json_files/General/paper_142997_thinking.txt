To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FUSED ATTENTION MECHANISM-BASED ORE SORTING NETWORK" by Junjiang Zhen and Bojun Xie, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions constructing a target detection dataset containing 6000 images of gold and sulfuric iron ore, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the dataset preparation process, stating that they collected a total of 1,913 high-definition ore images, which were labeled for training. They also mention that through data augmentation techniques, the final dataset volume was increased to 6090 images. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including its composition and the methods used to enhance it.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset appears to be constructed by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like other established datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is original and created specifically for this study.

The key datasets identified are:

1. **Gold and Sulfuric Iron Ore Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6090 images created through manual acquisition and data augmentation techniques. It is specifically designed for training the OreYOLO model for ore classification tasks.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details about the dataset and its origin. Since the dataset is original and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the purposes of this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
