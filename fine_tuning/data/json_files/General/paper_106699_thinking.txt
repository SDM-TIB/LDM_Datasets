To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Understanding of Scientific Experiments with End to End Symbolic Regression" by Nikos ArÃ©chiga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, and while it mentions a synthetic dataset, it does not provide specific names or details of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the symbolic regression problem and the need for interpretable models. Here, they mention the use of a public dataset from behavioral science to validate their technique, but they do not specify the name of this dataset yet.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the creation of a synthetic dataset for training their model. They explain how this dataset consists of noisy tabular data paired with symbolic expressions. However, this is a dataset they generated themselves, and I will need to document it accordingly.

Moving to the **results section**, the authors mention using a subset of the **Social Expected Utility (SEU) dataset** for testing their model. They provide a brief description of the dataset's purpose and how it relates to their experiments. This is a crucial point as it indicates that this dataset is used in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Social Expected Utility (SEU) dataset**, the citation is:
   > Iliev, R. 2021. *Social Expected Utility Dataset*. Available at: https://github.com/TRI-MAC/SEU.

2. The **synthetic dataset** does not have a formal citation since it was generated by the authors for their specific research purposes. I will note that it is a custom dataset created for training their model.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
