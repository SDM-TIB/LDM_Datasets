To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracing Text Provenance via Context-Aware Lexical Substitution" by Xi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets were used. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section**, where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using four datasets with different writing styles: **Novels**, **WikiText-2**, **IMDB**, and **AgNews**. I will note these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

In the **experiment settings** subsection, the authors provide more context about the datasets. They specify that for the Novels dataset, they selected works from Project Gutenberg, specifically **Wuthering Heights**, **Dracula**, and **Pride and Prejudice**. For the other datasets, they mention using the first 10,000 sentences from **WikiText-2**, **IMDB**, and **AgNews**, which are available from HuggingFace.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Wuthering Heights**: 
   > BrontÃ«, Emily. *Wuthering Heights*. Project Gutenberg. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/768

2. **Dracula**: 
   > Stoker, Bram. *Dracula*. Project Gutenberg. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/345

3. **Pride and Prejudice**: 
   > Austen, Jane. *Pride and Prejudice*. Project Gutenberg. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342

4. **WikiText-2**: 
   > Merity, S., Keskar, N. S., & Socher, R. (2017). *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.08215. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki_text

5. **IMDB**: 
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, S. J., Pham, P. T., Huang, J., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb

6. **AgNews**: 
   > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. Available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
