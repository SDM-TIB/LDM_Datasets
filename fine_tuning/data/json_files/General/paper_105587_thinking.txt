To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Amendable Generation for Dialogue State Tracking" by Xin Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results show significant improvements on two active dialogue state tracking datasets: **MultiWOZ 2.2** and **WOZ 2.0**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the context of their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention both datasets:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.2**: The authors describe it as a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset with over 10,000 dialogues, which includes human-human conversations. They also note that this version corrects a number of dialogue state annotation errors from the previous version.

2. **WOZ 2.0**: This dataset is identified as a well-known single-domain dialogue state tracking dataset, specifically for the restaurant domain, containing 1,200 dialogues.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will find the appropriate citations for both datasets:

- For **MultiWOZ 2.2**, the citation is:
  > Xiaoxue Zang, Abhinav Rastogi, Srinivas Sunkara, Raghav Gupta, Jianguo Zhang, and Jindong Chen. *MultiWOZ 2.2: A dialogue dataset with additional annotation corrections and state tracking baselines*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Conversational AI, 2020.

- For **WOZ 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Hsien Wen, David Vandyke, Nikola Mrkši´c, Milica Gaši´c, Lina M. Rojas-Barahona, Pei-Hao Su, Stefan Ultes, and Steve Young. *A network-based end-to-end trainable task-oriented dialogue system*. In Proceedings of the 15th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Volume 1, Long Papers, pages 438–449, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly to ensure that they are easily accessible for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
