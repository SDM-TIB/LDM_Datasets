To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Innovative Texture Database Collecting Approach and Feature Extraction Method based on Combination of Gray Tone Difference Matrixes, Local Binary Patterns, and K-means Clustering" by Shervan Fekri-Ershad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a new approach to collecting texture databases, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the author discusses the limitations of existing texture databases like Brodatz and Outex. This section hints that these databases are used for evaluation, but I need to confirm their details.

In the **results section**, the author explicitly mentions the use of the **Brodatz dataset**, which consists of 112 classes of textures, each represented by a single image of size 512x512. The author describes how they selected 12 classes randomly and cropped images to create a training and testing set. This confirms that the Brodatz dataset is a primary dataset used in the research.

Additionally, the author references the **Outex dataset** as another popular texture database used in texture classification. However, specific details about how it was utilized in this study are not provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Brodatz dataset**, the citation is:
  > Brodatz, P. *Textural Synthesis and the Brodatz Texture Database*. 1966.

- For the **Outex dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ojala, T., Pietikainen, M., & Maenpaa, T. *Outex - New Framework for Texture Classification*. 2002.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Brodatz Dataset**: A well-known texture dataset containing 112 classes of textures, each represented by a single image of size 512x512. The dataset is commonly used for evaluating texture classification methods.

2. **Outex Dataset**: Another popular texture dataset used for texture classification, providing a variety of texture images for benchmarking.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
