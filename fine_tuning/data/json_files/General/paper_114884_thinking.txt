To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KAM - A Kernel Attention Module for Emotion Classification with EEG Data" by Dongyang Kuang and Craig Michoski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on the **SEED dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Related Work)** and **section 4 (Experiments)** for more details about the SEED dataset. In section 4, the authors describe the SEED dataset as containing multiple physiological signals that evaluate self-reported emotional responses, classified into Positive, Neutral, and Negative reactions from 15 participants. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SEED dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **SEED dataset**, the citation is:
  > W.-L. Zheng and B.-L. Lu. *Investigating critical frequency bands and channels for EEG-based emotion recognition with deep neural networks*. IEEE Transactions on Autonomous Mental Development, 7(3):162â€“175, 2015.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SEED Dataset**: This dataset includes multiple physiological signals that evaluate self-reported emotional responses, classified into Positive, Neutral, and Negative reactions from 15 participants. It is one of the standard datasets for benchmarking EEG signal classification strategies.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included as it is crucial for proper referencing.
