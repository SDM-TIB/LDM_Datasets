To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Path-Norm Toolkit for Modern Networks: Consequences, Promises and Challenges" by Antoine Gonon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention key datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look into the **experiments** section, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **ImageNet** for their experiments. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, particularly for tasks involving image classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In this case, the authors also refer to a dataset related to their experiments on ResNets, but they do not specify any additional datasets beyond ImageNet.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation. The final output will include the following dataset entry:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

This structured approach ensures that I have thoroughly reviewed the paper for datasets and provided accurate citations for each one identified.
