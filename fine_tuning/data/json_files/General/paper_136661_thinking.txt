To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning with Extremely Noisy Clients via Negative Distillation" by Yang Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of their proposed method, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors state that they adopted **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. They describe how these datasets were used in the context of federated learning with extremely noisy clients.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report, 32–33, University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report, 32–33, University of Toronto.

Additionally, the authors mention using a public dataset **DU** for their experiments, which consists of images from **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet**. I will include this in my dataset extraction as well.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset used for training and testing in the experiments, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report, 32–33, University of Toronto.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Another dataset used in the experiments, similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical Report, 32–33, University of Toronto.

3. **ImageNet**: A public dataset used for training the model, consisting of a large number of images across various categories.
   - Citation: Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., & Bernstein, M. (2015). ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
