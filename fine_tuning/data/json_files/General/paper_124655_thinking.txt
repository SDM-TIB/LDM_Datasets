To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble weather forecast post-processing with a flexible probabilistic neural network approach" by Peter Mlakar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **EUPPBench benchmark** for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 2.3 (Training procedure)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **D11 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20-year re-forecasts for the years 2017 and 2018, with 209 time samples for both years and an ensemble of 11 members. This dataset is used for training.

2. **D51 Dataset**: This dataset includes forecasts for the same years (2017 and 2018) but has 730 time samples and an ensemble of 51 members. This dataset is designated for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the EUPPBench benchmark, which is crucial for understanding the datasets used. The citation for the benchmark is:

- Demaeyer, J., Bhend, J., Lerch, S., et al. "The EUPPBench postprocessing benchmark dataset v1.0." Earth System Science Data Discussions, 2023. https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-465.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **D11 Dataset**: Used for training, consisting of 20-year re-forecasts for 2017 and 2018.
   - Citation: Demaeyer, J., Bhend, J., Lerch, S., et al. "The EUPPBench postprocessing benchmark dataset v1.0." Earth System Science Data Discussions, 2023. https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-465.

2. **D51 Dataset**: Used for testing, including forecasts for 2017 and 2018.
   - Citation: Demaeyer, J., Bhend, J., Lerch, S., et al. "The EUPPBench postprocessing benchmark dataset v1.0." Earth System Science Data Discussions, 2023. https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2022-465.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
