To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On exponential convergence of SGD in non-convex over-parametrized learning" by Raef Bassily, Mikhail Belkin, and Siyuan Ma, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of SGD methods in over-parametrized models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. This section typically contains crucial information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to find explicit mentions of datasets. I will look for any descriptions of datasets used for empirical evaluations, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant details that could help in understanding their context.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will ensure to include the original citations for those datasets, even if they are not the primary focus of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
