To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Modifying a Neural Network’s Perception" by Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro and João Leite, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on a **synthetic dataset** and the **ImageNet dataset**, which suggests that these datasets are important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, particularly **section 2 (A Method to Manipulate a Neural Network’s Perception)**, where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they mention the **Explainable Abstract Trains Dataset (XTRAINS)**, which is a synthetic dataset used for their experiments. They provide a brief description of this dataset, indicating that it contains representations of trains and includes labels regarding various visual concepts.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the evaluations. The authors explicitly state that they applied their method to the **ImageNet dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Explainable Abstract Trains Dataset (XTRAINS)**, the citation is:
   > Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro, Ludwig Krippahl, and João Leite. *Explainable Abstract Trains Dataset*. CoRR, abs/2012.12115, 2020.

2. For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
