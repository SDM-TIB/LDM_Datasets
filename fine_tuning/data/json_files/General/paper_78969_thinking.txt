To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normalizing the Normalizers: Comparing and Extending Network Normalization Schemes" by Mengye Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention three specific datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10/100**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks. It contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, with images of size 32 × 32 × 3. The authors specify that CIFAR-10 has 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 has 100 classes.

2. **Penn Treebank Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for language modeling tasks. It consists of 42,068 training sentences, 3,370 validation sentences, and 3,761 test sentences.

3. **Set 14 and Berkeley 200 Datasets**: These datasets are used for image super-resolution tasks. The authors report performance metrics on these datasets, indicating their significance in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10/100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **Penn Treebank Dataset**:
  > Marcus, Mitchell P., Beatrice Santorini, and Mary Ann Marcinkiewicz. *Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English: The Penn Treebank*. Computational Linguistics, 19(2):313-330, 1993.

- For **Set 14**:
  > Zeyde, Roman, Elad, Michael, and Protter, Matan. *On single image scale-up using sparse representations*. In International Conference on Curves and Surfaces, pp. 711–730. Springer, 2010.

- For **Berkeley 200**:
  > Martin, David, Fowlkes, Charless, Tal, Doron, and Malik, Jitendra. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In ICCV, 2001.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
