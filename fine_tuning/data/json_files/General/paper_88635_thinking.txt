To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simulation of Turbulent Flow around a Generic High-Speed Train using Hybrid Models of RANS Numerical Method with Machine Learning" by Alireza Hajipour et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or analyses.

Next, I will examine the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or data points that were collected or generated during their experiments. This includes looking for tables or figures that summarize data, as these often indicate the presence of datasets.

In the **computational simulation section**, the authors describe the parameters and conditions under which the simulations were conducted, including wind directions and velocities. I will note any specific datasets that are referenced, particularly those related to aerodynamic coefficients, pressure coefficients, and other key parameters.

I will also check the **tables and figures** throughout the paper, as they often contain summarized data that can be considered datasets. For instance, tables that list aerodynamic coefficients for different wind directions and velocities will be important to extract.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies that are cited. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the study.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets from previous studies or established datasets in the field, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that clearly presents the information for each dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
