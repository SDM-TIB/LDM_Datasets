To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Deep Learning Learn to Abstract? A Systematic Probing Framework" by Shengnan An et al., I will follow a structured approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or tasks that involve datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the probing framework and the tasks designed for the experiments. This section typically contains specific information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the paper, the authors mention using datasets derived from the **COGS (Compositional Generalization Challenge)** for their probing tasks. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and purpose in the context of the experiments.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **appendices** that might provide further context or additional datasets used in their analysis.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the datasets identified, I will ensure to include:

1. **COGS Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating compositional generalization in language models. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kim, N., & Linzen, T. (2020). *COGS: A Compositional Generalization Challenge Based on Semantic Interpretation*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 9087–9105.

2. **Europarl Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of fuzzy grammar probing. The citation is:
   > Koehn, P. (2005). *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit X: Papers, pp. 79–86.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as outlined above.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
