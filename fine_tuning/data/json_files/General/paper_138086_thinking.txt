To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Sparse Fine-Tuning to Large Language Models" by Alan Ansell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention experimenting with "standard dataset mixtures," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Training and Evaluation Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for instruction-tuning LLMs. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Flan v2**: A dataset collecting manually annotated examples for multiple tasks augmented with instructions. The authors reference the work by Longpre et al. (2023) for details.

2. **GPT4-Alpaca**: A dataset of outputs generated by the GPT-4 model, prompted with inputs from Alpaca. The citation for this dataset is provided by Peng et al. (2023).

3. **Tulu v2**: A mixture consisting of examples from multiple instruction-following datasets, with a citation to Ivison et al. (2023).

In addition to these datasets, I will also check the **experiments** and **results** sections to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation and to gather any additional context about their application.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Flan v2**, the citation is:
  > Longpre, S., Hou, L., Vu, T., Webson, A., Chung, H. W., Tay, Y., Zhou, D., Le, Q. V., Zoph, B., Wei, J., and Roberts, A. (2023). The flan collection: Designing data and methods for effective instruction tuning. In International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2023, 23-29 July 2023, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

- For **GPT4-Alpaca**, the citation is:
  > Peng, B., Li, C., He, P., Galley, M., and Gao, J. (2023). Instruction tuning with GPT-4. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.03277.

- For **Tulu v2**, the citation is:
  > Ivison, H., Wang, Y., Pyatkin, V., Lambert, N., Peters, M., Dasigi, P., Jang, J., Wadden, D., Smith, N. A., Beltagy, I., and Hajishirzi, H. (2023). Camels in a changing climate: Enhancing LM adaptation with Tulu 2. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.10702.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
