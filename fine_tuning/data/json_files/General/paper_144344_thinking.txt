To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Impact of Ontology on the Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease Compared to Machine Learning Algorithms" by Noreddine Gherabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the dataset used consists of **70,000 instances** and can be downloaded from the **Kaggle website**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant mentions in the **methods** or **evaluation** sections. In the **methods section**, it is confirmed that the dataset is indeed from Kaggle and consists of **12 features** related to cardiovascular disease. The paper provides a detailed description of the dataset's attributes, which is crucial for understanding its structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset can be accessed via a link to Kaggle, which is a common practice for datasets in research papers.

The citation for the dataset is:
> "Cardiovascular Disease dataset." Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset (accessed Feb. 24, 2022).

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and accurately represented.
