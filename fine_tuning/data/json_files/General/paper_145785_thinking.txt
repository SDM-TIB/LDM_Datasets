To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Generative Adversarial Networks for Video Super-Resolution" by Daniel Wen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the model but does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about video super-resolution but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the author states that they utilized paired videos from the "RealVSR dataset" for training and low-quality sequences from "LQ_test.zip" for testing. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved in the research.

I will then look for more details about these datasets in the **results section**. The author mentions that the "videos.zip" file from the RealVSR dataset contains paired low-quality and high-quality videos, which are crucial for training the model. This is an important detail that I need to capture.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RealVSR dataset. The reference is as follows:

- For the **RealVSR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Xi, et al. “Real-world Video Super-resolution: A Benchmark Dataset and A Decomposition based Learning Scheme.” International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021, https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Yang_Real-World_Video_Super-Resolution_A_Benchmark_Dataset_and_a_Decomposition_Based_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf.

The "LQ_test.zip" is mentioned as a source for low-quality sequences, but it does not have a formal citation in the references. Therefore, I will note it as a dataset used in the study without a formal citation.

In summary, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **RealVSR dataset**: Used for training with paired low-quality and high-quality videos.
2. **LQ_test.zip**: Used for testing with low-quality sequences.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the RealVSR dataset.
