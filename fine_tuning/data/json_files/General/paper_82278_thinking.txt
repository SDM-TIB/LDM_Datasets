To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Network Interpolation for Continuous Imagery Effect Transition" by Xintao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and applications sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments and the models they used. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets employed in their studies. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to existing datasets that the authors utilized.

In the **applications section**, the authors discuss various tasks such as image restoration, image-to-image translation, and style transfer. I will check if they mention any datasets used for training or testing their models in these applications.

After identifying potential datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CelebA dataset** for face attribute manipulation, I will look for the citation in the references section, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Once I have gathered all the relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
