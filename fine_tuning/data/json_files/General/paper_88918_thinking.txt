To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wrapper Feature Selection Algorithm for the Optimization of An Indicator System of Patent Value Assessment" by Yihui Qiu and Chiyu Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted verification experiments on multiple UCI standard datasets, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they mention that they used **eight UCI standard datasets** for their verification experiments. I will look for a table or a list that provides the names and characteristics of these datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the datasets along with their features, samples, and classes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Zoo Dataset**: 16 features, 101 samples, 7 classes.
2. **Wine Dataset**: 13 features, 178 samples, 3 classes.
3. **Sonar Dataset**: 60 features, 208 samples, 2 classes.
4. **Waveform Dataset**: 21 features, 5000 samples, 4 classes.
5. **Ionosphere Dataset**: 34 features, 351 samples, 2 classes.
6. **Soybean Dataset**: 35 features, 47 samples, 7 classes.
7. **Segmentation Dataset**: 19 features, 210 samples, 2 classes.
8. **Hepatitis Dataset**: 19 features, 155 samples, 2 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a common source for these datasets, and I will look for the appropriate citations or links.

The citations for the datasets are typically found in the UCI repository or related publications. For example, the UCI repository citation is:

- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Blake, C. L. (1998). UCI repository of machine learning databases. Retrieved from http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that highlights the names, characteristics, and citations of each dataset for clarity and completeness.
