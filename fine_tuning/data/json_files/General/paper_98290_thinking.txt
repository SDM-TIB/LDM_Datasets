To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Experiments with Rich Regime Training for Deep Learning" by Xinyan Li and Arindam Banerjee, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors study rich regime training empirically with benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental setup** section. In this paper, the authors mention using two benchmark datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. I will note down these datasets and look for detailed descriptions in the experimental setup section.

In the **experimental setup (Section 3)**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **MNIST**: A subset of the MNIST dataset containing 10,000 samples, with an equal number of samples selected from each class.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:
- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report Vol. 1. No. 4., University of Toronto, 2009.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
