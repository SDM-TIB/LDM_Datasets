To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provably Robust Adversarial Examples" by Dimitar I. Dimitrov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the paper, I notice that the authors mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR10** datasets for their experiments. I will gather specific details about how these datasets were used, such as the types of neural networks tested and the nature of the adversarial examples generated.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation for the CIFAR10 dataset is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
