To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Pulse-Coupled Neural Networks" by Zexiang Yi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on four mainstream datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant subsections within the **experiments** section. In this case, the authors provide details about the datasets in **section IV (Experiments)**, specifically under **subsection A (Datasets and Preprocessing)**. Here, they list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits and contains 70,000 samples (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). Each sample is a grayscale image of size 28x28.

2. **N-MNIST**: This is a neuromorphic version of the MNIST dataset, representing information through asynchronous events. Each sample has a resolution of 34x34.

3. **Fashion-MNIST**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset contains clothing images across 10 categories, with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples, each represented as a grayscale 28x28 pixel matrix.

4. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset comprises 60,000 natural images of size 32x32, spread across 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will proceed to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278-2324, 1998.

- For **N-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > G. Orchard, A. Jayawant, G. K. Cohen, and N. Thakor. "Converting Static Image Datasets to Spiking Neuromorphic Datasets Using Saccades." *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, vol. 9, Nov. 2015.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. "Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms." arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. "The CIFAR-10 dataset." Online: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, 2014.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
