To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Normalizador Neural de Datas e EndereÃ§os" by Gustavo Plensack and Paulo Finardi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem being addressed, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the creation of synthetic datasets for dates and addresses, indicating that these datasets are central to their research. This prompts me to look for detailed descriptions in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets they created. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **Dataset for Dates**: This dataset includes various formats of dates, created synthetically with 45 formats for absolute dates, 90 for incomplete dates, and 36 for relative dates. The authors detail the construction process, including the types of noise introduced and the variety of formats used.

2. **Dataset for Addresses**: This dataset was created using real postal codes (CEPs) and includes 22 different address formats in Brazilian Portuguese. The authors explain how they combined real data with random values to generate this dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. The authors reference several sources that contributed to the creation of their datasets, such as:

- **DateParser**: 
  > Dateparser. Python readable dates. Available at: https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser, 2020.

- **CEP Source**: 
  > QualoCEP. Available at: https://www.qualocep.com/base-de-cep, 2020.

- **API for Addresses**: 
  > WebmaniaBR. Available at: https://webmaniabr.com/docs/rest-api-cep-ibge/, 2020.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and the relevant citations that support their creation and use.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
