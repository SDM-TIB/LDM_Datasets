To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Contrastive Methods for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations" by Wouter Van Gansbeke et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors study the effects of dataset biases on contrastive self-supervised learning, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the reliance on curated datasets like ImageNet and mention the need to quantify the influence of dataset biases. This hints at the presence of datasets but does not provide specific names yet.

In the **framework section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention several datasets used for pretraining. I will focus on **Table 1**, which provides an overview of the training datasets. The datasets listed are:

1. **ImageNet-118K**: A uniform subset of the ImageNet dataset containing 118,000 images.
2. **ImageNet-118K-LT**: A long-tailed version of the ImageNet dataset, also containing 118,000 images.
3. **COCO**: A well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation.
4. **OpenImages-118K**: A random subset of the OpenImages dataset containing 118,000 images.
5. **BDD100K**: A dataset for urban scene understanding, containing 90,000 images.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the experiments, which they are.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **OpenImages**, the citation is:
  > Kuznetsova, A., Rom, H., Alldrin, N., Uijlings, J., Krasin, I., Pont-Tuset, J., Kamali, S., Popov, S., Malloci, M., Kolesnikov, A., et al. (2020). *The open images dataset v4*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

- For **BDD100K**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Chen, H., Wang, X., Xian, W., Chen, Y., Liu, F., Madhavan, V., Darrell, T. (2020). *Bdd100k: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
