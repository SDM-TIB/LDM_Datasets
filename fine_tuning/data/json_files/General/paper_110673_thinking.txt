To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Which Discriminator for Cooperative Text Generation?" by Antoine Chaffin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of different types of discriminators for cooperative text generation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical study section (Section 3)**, as this is where the authors typically describe their experiments and the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention two datasets: **amazon_polarity** and **AG_news**. They describe the nature of these datasets, indicating that **amazon_polarity** is a binary classification task for online reviews, while **AG_news** is a topic classification task with four labels (world, sport, business, and science). This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' purposes and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites a source for the datasets as follows:

- For **amazon_polarity**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Jake Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, December 7-12, 2015, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, pages 649–657. 

- For **AG_news**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Zhao, Junbo Jake, and LeCun, Yann. *Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2015, December 7-12, 2015, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, pages 649–657.

Now that I have the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the steps I followed were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the empirical study section to identify the datasets used in experiments.
3. Retrieve full citations from the references section for each dataset.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
