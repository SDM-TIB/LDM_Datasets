To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Whole-Sample Mapping of Cancerous and Benign Tissue Properties" by Lydia Neary-Zajiczek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure tissue properties, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction elaborates on the methods used for cancer detection but still lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that detail sample preparation and measurements. Here, the authors describe the clinical liver tissue samples obtained for their study, indicating that they used both healthy and cancerous tissue sections. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets or specific dataset names.

I will also look into the **results section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of the findings. The results discuss the differences in elastic modulus between healthy and cancerous tissues, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets used in the study. The references primarily cite previous works related to the methods and findings but do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the authors conducted experiments using clinical samples, they did not utilize any publicly available datasets or provide specific dataset names that can be cited. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The research utilized clinical samples of liver tissue but did not reference any external datasets.

This process highlights the importance of carefully reviewing each section of a research paper to extract relevant datasets and their citations, even when they may not be explicitly stated.
