To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A topic-aware graph neural network model for knowledge base updating" by Jiajun Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the importance of knowledge bases and the challenges of keeping them updated, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses the need for an up-to-date knowledge base and references various methods but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Moving on to the **methods section**, I will look for any details about how the authors constructed their dataset. Here, they mention that they built a structure of multiple heterogeneous graphs for each entity and that they randomly selected 1000 entities from user logs, marking them according to their Wikidata modification records. This indicates that they created a dataset based on user interactions and entity attributes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more details about their dataset. They state that they used 1000 labeled entities, which were divided into training, validation, and test sets. They also mention that they stored the data in Neo4j for better read and write performance. However, they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for their study.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing various aspects of knowledge bases and graph neural networks, rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for their custom dataset, I will note that the dataset is based on user logs and Wikidata modification records, but I cannot provide a full citation as it does not exist in a public repository.

In summary, I will document the following dataset information:

1. **Custom Dataset of 1000 Entities**: This dataset was created by randomly selecting entities from user logs and marking them based on their modification records from Wikidata. It is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
