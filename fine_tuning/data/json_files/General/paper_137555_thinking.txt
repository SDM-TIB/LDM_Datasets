To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Multi-Stage Prompting Approach for Language Agnostic MCQ Generation using GPT" by Subhankar Maity et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of GPT models for generating multiple choice questions (MCQs) and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. The introduction provides context about the importance of automating MCQ generation and references various datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for the question generation task in the **Experiments** section.

I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **SQuAD**: This dataset is described as consisting of more than 100K carefully crafted questions in English. It is a well-known dataset for question answering tasks.

2. **GermanQuAD**: This dataset contains over 13K human-generated QA pairs sourced from German Wikipedia articles, specifically designed for question answering in German.

3. **HiQuAD**: This dataset is tailored for generating questions in Hindi and consists of 6,555 pairs of questions and answers created based on a Hindi storybook.

4. **BanglaRQA**: This dataset includes more than 14K human-generated QA pairs in Bengali, also sourced from Wikipedia articles.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:

- For **BanglaRQA**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately described and cited in the final output. This structured approach will help in compiling a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research paper, complete with their full citations.
