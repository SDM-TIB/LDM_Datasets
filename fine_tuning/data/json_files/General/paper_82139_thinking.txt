To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Holistic Multi-modal Memory Network for Movie Question Answering" by Anran Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the **MovieQA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide details about the dataset used. Here, they explicitly state that the **MovieQA dataset** consists of 408 movies and 14,944 questions, and it includes diverse sources of information such as video clips, plots, subtitles, scripts, and Descriptive Video Service (DVS). This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides some context about its structure.

I will also check the **related works section** (Section II) to see if there are any other datasets mentioned that might be relevant to the research. The authors reference the **MovieQA dataset** again, emphasizing its importance in the context of multi-modal question answering.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MovieQA dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> M. Tapaswi, Y. Zhu, R. Stiefelhagen, A. Torralba, R. Urtasun, and S. Fidler. *MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Since the MovieQA dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation for future reference or processing.
