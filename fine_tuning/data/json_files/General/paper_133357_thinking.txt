To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustering of Spell Variations for Proper Nouns" by Prathamesh Pawar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the problem and the proposed method, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **data extraction** sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the challenges of transliterating proper nouns from Indian languages and mentions that the study aims to cluster misspelled versions of these words. However, specific datasets are not named here.

Next, I will examine the **data extraction section** where the author explicitly mentions the datasets used for the experiments. The paper lists two datasets:

1. **Mumbai Apartments (D1)**: This dataset contains 16,295 entries of apartment names obtained from public deed records in Mumbai. It is used to demonstrate the clustering of spell variations.

2. **Delhi Localities (D2)**: This dataset consists of 13,120 entries of localities extracted from government records of real estate property addresses in Delhi. It serves a similar purpose in testing the proposed method.

Both datasets are described in terms of their size and the context in which they are used, which is crucial for understanding their relevance to the research.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from public records. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are based on publicly available data but do not have formal citations.

To summarize, I will document the datasets as follows:

1. **Mumbai Apartments (D1)**: A dataset of 16,295 apartment names from public deed records in Mumbai.
2. **Delhi Localities (D2)**: A dataset of 13,120 locality names from government records of real estate property addresses in Delhi.

Since there are no formal citations provided for these datasets, I will indicate that they are based on public records without specific references.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
