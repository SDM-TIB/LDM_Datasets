To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Mixed-Block Neural Architecture Search for Medical Image Segmentation" by Martijn M.A. Bosma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Method)**, particularly **subsection 2.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **Prostate Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3D MRI scans of the prostate, with multi-class segmentations for the central and peripheral prostate zones. It includes 32 multi-modal scans represented as a total of 602 2D slices.

2. **Spleen Dataset**: This dataset contains 3D CT scans with single-class segmentations of the spleen. It consists of 41 single-modality scans represented as 3650 2D slices.

The authors also provide details about the normalization and preprocessing of these datasets, which is important for understanding their usage in the experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors mention that the datasets can be found on the Medical Decathlon challenge website. Therefore, I will look for the citation related to the Medical Decathlon:

- For the **Medical Decathlon**, the citation is:
  > Antonelli, M. et al., “The Medical Segmentation Decathlon,” (2021).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
