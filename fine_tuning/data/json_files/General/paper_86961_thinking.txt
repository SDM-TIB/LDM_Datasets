To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Promoting the Knowledge of Source Syntax in Transformer NMT Is Not Needed" by Thuong-Hai Pham, Dominik Macháček, and Ondřej Bojar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **Section 3 (Data and Common Settings)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention two language pairs: **German-to-Czech (de2cs)** and **Czech-to-English (cs2en)**. They specify that the German-to-Czech translation is trained on the **Europarl** and **OpenSubtitles2016** datasets, while the Czech-to-English translation is trained on a subset of **CzEng 1.7**.

I will extract the following details for each dataset:

1. **Europarl**: This dataset is used for the German-to-Czech translation task. It is a well-known parallel corpus derived from the proceedings of the European Parliament.

2. **OpenSubtitles2016**: Another dataset used for the German-to-Czech translation, which consists of subtitles from movies and TV shows.

3. **CzEng 1.7**: This dataset is used for the Czech-to-English translation task and is a large parallel corpus that includes various sources.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for are:

- For **Europarl**:
  > Koehn, P. (2005). Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation. In Proceedings of the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, AAMT, Phuket, Thailand, pp. 79–86.

- For **OpenSubtitles2016**:
  > Tiedemann, J. (2009). News from OPUS - A collection of multilingual parallel corpora with tools and interfaces. In Proc. of RANLP, volume V. John Benjamins, Amsterdam/Philadelphia, Borovets, Bulgaria, pp. 237–248.

- For **CzEng 1.7**:
  > Bojar, O., Dušek, O., Kocmi, T., Libovický, J., Novák, M., Popel, M., Sudarikov, R., & Variš, D. (2016). CzEng 1.6: Enlarged Czech-English Parallel Corpus with Processing Tools Dockered. In Text, Speech, and Dialogue: 19th International Conference, TSD 2016, number 9924 in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Masaryk University, Springer International Publishing, pp. 231–238.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
