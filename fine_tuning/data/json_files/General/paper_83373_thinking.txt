To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch Clustering for Representation of Histopathology Images" by Wafa Chenni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **KimiaPath24 dataset** for evaluating the proposed methods, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the **KimiaPath24 dataset** as containing 24 whole slide images (WSIs) from diverse organs and tissue types, with a total of 1325 test images (patches) of size 1000 Ã— 1000 pixels. They also mention that the dataset can be downloaded online, which is useful for verification.

In the **Results** section, the authors discuss the performance of their methods using the **KimiaPath24 dataset**, confirming its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **KimiaPath24 dataset** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:

- For **KimiaPath24 dataset**:
  > Babaie, M., Kalra, S., Sriram, A., Mitcheltree, C., Zhu, S., Khatami, A., Rahnamayan, S., Tizhoosh, H.R. (2017). *Classification and retrieval of digital pathology scans: A new dataset*. In: CVMI Workshop@ CVPR.

Since the dataset is referenced in the context of a workshop, I will ensure to include this citation in the final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **KimiaPath24 dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any required downstream processing or review.
