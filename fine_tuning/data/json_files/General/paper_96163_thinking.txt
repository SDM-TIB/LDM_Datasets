To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Sentiment Analysis Engine for Preliminary Depression Status Estimation on Social Media" by Sudhir Kumar Suman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a publicly available dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors discuss the dataset used for training and testing their model. They mention that the backend model was initially tuned on a publicly available Twitter sentiment dataset. This is a key point, as it directly references a dataset.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset Used)**, the authors provide more details about the dataset, including that it is publicly available and that rigorous text cleansing methods were applied prior to training. However, they do not provide the dataset's name in this section, so I will need to look for it in the references.

To find the full citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section**. The authors cite the dataset as follows:

- For the **Twitter sentiment dataset**, the citation is:
  > Go, A., Bhayani, R., & Huang, L. (2009). *Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision*. 2009, p.12.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Twitter Sentiment Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification and is publicly available. It contains tweets labeled with sentiments (positive and negative) and was used to fine-tune the authors' model.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
