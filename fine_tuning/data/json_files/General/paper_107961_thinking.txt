To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-rank features based double transformation matrices learning for image classification" by Yu-Hong Cai, Xiao-Jun Wu, and Zhe Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that "Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for classification," indicating that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three face databases and one object database:

1. **AR Database**: The authors describe it as containing over 4,000 color images corresponding to 126 people's faces with various expressions and conditions. They used a subset of 3,120 images for their experiments.

2. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Database**: This database contains over 13,000 face images of 5,749 people. The authors used a subset of 1,251 images for their experiments.

3. **CMU Pose, Illumination, and Expression (CMU PIE) Database**: This database includes 41,368 images of 68 people under various poses and expressions. The authors selected a subset of 11,554 images for their experiments.

4. **Columbia Object Image Library (COIL20) Database**: This dataset consists of images of 20 objects taken from different angles, with 72 images per object. The authors used a specific subset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **AR Database**, the citation is:
  > A. Martínez, R. Benavente. *The AR face database*. Tech. Rep. 24 CVC Technical Report 24, 1998.

- For the **LFW Database**, the citation is:
  > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Tech. Rep. 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 2007.

- For the **CMU PIE Database**, the citation is:
  > T. Sim, S. Baker, M. Bsat. *The CMU pose, illumination, and expression database*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, 25(3):1615–1618, 2003.

- For the **COIL20 Database**, the citation is:
  > S. A. Nene, S. K. Nayar, H. Murase. *Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-20)*. Technical report CUCS-006-96, 1996.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
