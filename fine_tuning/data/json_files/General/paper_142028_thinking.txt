To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoofDiffusion: Constructing Roofs from Severely Corrupted Point Data via Diffusion" by Kyle Shih-Huang Lo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions a new dataset of 13k complex roof geometries, which indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** (in this case, section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this section, the authors discuss the **PoznanRD dataset**, which consists of 13k buildings with complex roof geometries. They also mention the process of balancing the dataset and the challenges of synthesizing corrupted height maps.

I will note the key details about the PoznanRD dataset:
- It contains 13,000 noise-free complex roof meshes and height maps.
- The dataset is designed to address long-tail issues in remote sensing and is suitable for machine learning research.

Additionally, the authors reference other datasets in the context of their experiments and comparisons. I will identify these datasets:
1. **BuildingNet**: Mentioned as a dataset used for evaluation, which contains compact and noise-free building meshes.
2. **USGS 3DEP LiDAR**: Referenced multiple times as a source of real-world scans for qualitative assessments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

1. **PoznanRD Dataset**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper, it does not have a separate citation but is described in detail.
2. **BuildingNet**: The citation is:
   > Selvaraju, P., Nabail, M., Loizou, M., Maslioukova, M., Averkiou, M., Andreou, A., Chaudhuri, S., Kalogerakis, E. "BuildingNet: Learning to label 3D buildings." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 10397â€“10407, 2021.
3. **USGS 3DEP LiDAR**: The citation is:
   > Survey, U.G. "MI Wayne County 2017 A17 345307 LAS." https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/LPC/Projects/MI_WayneCounty_2017_A17/, accessed: July 1, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the research paper.
