To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IGFormer: Interaction Graph Transformer for Skeleton-based Human Interaction Recognition" by Yunsheng Pang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SBU Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing eight classes of human interactions, with a total of 282 short videos, each containing 3D coordinates of 15 joints per person at each frame.

2. **NTU-RGB+D Dataset**: This is a large-scale action dataset with 56,578 skeleton sequences from 60 action classes. It includes 3D coordinates of 25 body joints and has two evaluation protocols: Cross-Subject and Cross-View.

3. **NTU-RGB+D120 Dataset**: This dataset extends the NTU-RGB+D dataset with an additional 57,367 samples from 60 extra action classes, totaling 113,945 skeleton sequences. It also has two evaluation protocols: Cross-Subject and Cross-Setup.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **SBU Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NTU-RGB+D Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NTU-RGB+D120 Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
