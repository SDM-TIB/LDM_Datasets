To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal stopping via reinforced regression" by D. Belomestny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed methodology, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **numerical examples** sections, as these are likely to contain references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of solving optimal stopping problems and mention various approaches, but they do not specify any datasets. I will then move to the **numerical examples** section, where the authors present two specific examples: the **Bermudan max-call on d assets** and the **Bermudan cancelable swap**. 

In the **Bermudan max-call example**, the authors describe the parameters and the setup for the experiment, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset. Instead, they refer to generating paths for simulations, which implies that the data is synthetic and generated for the purpose of the study rather than sourced from an existing dataset.

Next, I will check the **Bermudan cancelable swap example**. Similar to the previous example, the authors describe the model and parameters used for the simulation but do not reference any external datasets. They focus on the methodology and results derived from their simulations.

Since the paper does not cite any external datasets but rather relies on synthetic data generated for their experiments, I will note that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. 

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses numerical examples and methodologies, it does not reference any specific datasets from external sources. Therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile or cite.

In conclusion, I will prepare a message indicating that no datasets were found in the paper that require citation, as the authors utilized synthetic data generated for their experiments.
