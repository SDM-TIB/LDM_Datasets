To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StyleGAN knows Normal, Depth, Albedo, and More" by Anand Bhattad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses intrinsic images and references various properties like depth, normal, albedo, and shading, but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction provides context about intrinsic images but does not list any datasets either.

Next, I will examine the **methodology sections**, particularly **section 4 (Searching for Intrinsic Offsets)**, where the authors describe their approach to generating intrinsic images using StyleGAN. Here, they mention using off-the-shelf networks for various intrinsic properties, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

In **section 5 (Accuracy of StyleGAN Intrinsics)**, the authors reference several datasets indirectly through the mention of methods that utilize them. For example, they refer to the **Omnidata-v2** and **ZoeDepth** methods for surface normals and depth, respectively. This indicates that these methods are based on datasets that I need to identify.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations I need to extract are:

1. **Omnidata-v2**: 
   > Ainaz Eftekhar, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Amir Zamir. *Omnidata: A scalable pipeline for making multi-task mid-level vision datasets from 3D scans*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021.

2. **ZoeDepth**: 
   > Shariq Farooq Bhat, Reiner Birkl, Diana Wofk, Peter Wonka, and Matthias MÃ¼ller. *ZoeDepth: Zero-shot transfer by combining relative and metric depth*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.12288, 2023.

3. **EVA-2**: 
   > Yuxin Fang, Quan Sun, Xinggang Wang, Tiejun Huang, Xinlong Wang, and Yue Cao. *EVA-02: A visual representation for neon genesis*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.11331, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their authoritative sources.
