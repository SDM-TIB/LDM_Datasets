To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Debugging using Orthogonal Gradient Descent" by Narsimha Chilkuri and Chris Eliasmith, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **MNIST dataset** for experiments, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) in detail. In section 4.1, the authors describe an experiment involving the MNIST dataset, specifically noting that they used a corrupted version of it for their unlearning experiment. They clarify that the standard train/test split of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images was utilized, which confirms the dataset's relevance.

In section 4.2, the authors again refer to the MNIST dataset for their relearning experiment, indicating that the same dataset is used throughout their experiments. This consistency reinforces the importance of the MNIST dataset in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in many papers. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the MNIST dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
