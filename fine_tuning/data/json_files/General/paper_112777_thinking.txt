To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharing Pattern Submodels for Prediction with Missing Values" by Lena Stempfle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of missing values in machine learning and hints at the use of real-world datasets for experiments, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

Upon reviewing Section 5, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)**: This dataset is used for both classification and regression tasks. It includes clinical data, neuroimaging, and genetic data from 1337 subjects. The goal is to predict cognitive test outcomes based on baseline data.

2. **SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments)**: This dataset is used to model survival over a 180-day period in seriously ill hospitalized adults. It contains data from 9104 subjects and focuses on various physiological scores.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ADNI**, the citation is:
  > Weiner, M. W., Aisen, P. S., Jack, C. R., Jr., Jagust, W. J., Trojanowski, J. Q., Shaw, L. M., Saykin, A. J., Morris, J. C., Cairns, N. J., Beckett, L. A., Toga, A. W., Green, R. C., Walter, S., Soares, H., Snyder, P. J., Siemers, E. R., Potter, W. Z., Cole, P. E., Schmidt, M., & Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. (2010). The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: Progress report and future plans. *Alzheimer’s & Dementia*, 6(3), 202–211.e7. doi:10.1016/j.jalz.2010.03.007.

- For **SUPPORT**, the citation is:
  > Knaus, W. A., Harrell, F. E., Lynn, J., Goldman, L., Phillips, R. S., Connors, A. F., Dawson, N. V., Fulkerson, W. J., Califf, R. M., Desbiens, N., et al. (1995). The SUPPORT prognostic model: Objective estimates of survival for seriously ill hospitalized adults. *Annals of Internal Medicine*, 122(3), 191–203.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
