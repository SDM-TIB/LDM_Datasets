To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning the Messages in Message Passing Inference" by Guosheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method to **semantic image segmentation on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely to be one of the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and the categories involved.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> M. Everingham, L. V. Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset for its experiments, I will ensure that I capture all relevant details about this dataset, including its application in semantic segmentation tasks.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
