To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Spectral Bias and Robustness for Two-Layer Neural Networks: SGD vs Adaptive Random Fourier Features" by Aku Kammonen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the MNIST dataset, which is a strong indicator that it will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the supervised learning problem and the context of their experiments, but they do not introduce any new datasets. However, they do reference the MNIST dataset again, confirming its relevance to their experiments.

I will then focus on the **Datasets section** (which is explicitly mentioned in the paper). In this section, the authors provide a detailed description of the MNIST dataset, stating that it consists of 70,000 handwritten digit images of size 28 Ã— 28, along with their corresponding labels. They also mention how they partition the dataset into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 7:2:1.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically included in many papers. The citation is as follows:

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's details and its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
