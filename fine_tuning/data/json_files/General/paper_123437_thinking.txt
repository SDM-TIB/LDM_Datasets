To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting Digital Biomarkers for Unobtrusive Stress State Screening from Multimodal Wearable Data" by Berrenur Saylam and Özlem Durmaz İncel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Tesserae dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Tesserae dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the dataset as being collected from office workers using smartphones and wearable devices over a year. They mention that it includes data on activity tracking, heart rate, sleep, and location, which are crucial for understanding stress levels.

In the **methodology section**, they provide a detailed description of the dataset, including the number of participants (757), the types of data collected (e.g., from smartphones and Garmin watches), and the nature of the ground truth data collected through questionnaires. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and application.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Tesserae dataset**. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Mattingly, Stephen M., et al. "The tesserae project: Large-scale, longitudinal, in situ, multimodal sensing of information workers." Extended Abstracts of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Tesserae Dataset**: This dataset is used to measure workplace performance via psychological traits and physical characteristics over one year, collected from 757 subjects using smartphones and wearable devices.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution.
