To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Transformers for Weakly Supervised Object Localization in Unconstrained Videos" by Shakeeb Murtaza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on challenging YouTube-Objects unconstrained video datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental methodology section** (section 4.1) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **YouTube-Object v1.0 (YTOv1)**: This dataset consists of various videos collected from YouTube, categorized into ten classes. It includes 155 videos segmented into short clips, resulting in 5507 shorts with a total of 571,089 frames. The authors also mention that some frames have bounding box annotations for validation and testing.

2. **YouTube-Object v2.2 (YTOv2.2)**: This is an extension of YTOv1, comprising 722,040 frames and a larger number of bounding box annotations across 155 videos divided into 9 categories. The dataset has 106 videos for training and 49 for testing, with a total of 2,667 bounding boxes in the test set.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **YouTube-Object v1.0**, the citation is:
  > Prest, A., Leistner, C., Civera, J., Schmid, C., & Ferrari, V. (2012). Learning object class detectors from weakly annotated video. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2012.

- For **YouTube-Object v2.2**, the citation is:
  > Kalogeiton, V., Ferrari, V., & Schmid, C. (2016). Analysing domain shift factors between videos and images for object detection. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)*, 38(11), 2327-2334.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
