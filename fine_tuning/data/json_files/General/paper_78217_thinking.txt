To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determinantal Point Processes for Mini-Batch Diversification" by Cheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mini-batch diversification, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **R8 dataset** for evaluating their method in a supervised scenario. I will look for details about this dataset, such as its size, characteristics, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the experiments, the authors also refer to the **Oxford 102 Flower dataset** for a fine-grained classification task. I will gather information about this dataset as well, including its structure and how it was utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **R8 dataset**, the citation is:
> R. H. Affandi, A. Kulesza, E. B. Fox, and B. Taskar. *Nystrom approximation for large-scale determinantal processes*. In AISTATS, pages 85â€“98, 2013.

For the **Oxford 102 Flower dataset**, the citation is:
> M. E. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In ICVGIP, 2008.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, including its name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
