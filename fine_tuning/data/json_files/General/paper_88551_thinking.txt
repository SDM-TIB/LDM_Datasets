To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Searching for Stage-Wise Neural Graphs in the Limit" by Xin Zhou, Dejing Dou, and Boyang Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **abstract**, I will look for any mention of datasets or benchmarks. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors may discuss the datasets in the context of previous work or their own methodology, which can provide insights into the datasets' characteristics and relevance to the research.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets, where the authors may describe the datasets' sizes, types, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

If the authors refer to another dataset, such as **ImageNet**, I will find its citation as well:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing complete citations for each one.
