To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IS THE U-NET DIRECTIONAL-RELATIONSHIP AWARE?" by Mateus Riva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "pretext segmentation task" and a "synthetic dataset," which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the **Cloud of Structured Objects (CSO) dataset** in detail. This section outlines how the dataset is constructed, including the types of objects used, their arrangement, and the noise elements added to the images. The CSO dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper, as it is specifically designed to test the U-Net's ability to reason about directional relationships.

In addition to the CSO dataset, I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference **Fashion-MNIST** as a source for generating the CSO dataset. This is important to note as it provides context for the objects used in the CSO dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Cloud of Structured Objects (CSO) Dataset**: The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is a synthetic dataset created by the authors. However, I will document it as a dataset used in their experiments.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. Available at: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
