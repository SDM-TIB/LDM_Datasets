To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast and Regularized Reconstruction of Building Facades from Street-View Images Using Binary Integer Programming" by Han Hua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of street-view images for facade reconstruction, which suggests that there may be datasets related to street-view images.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using Google Street View images as a source for their experiments. This indicates that the Google Street View dataset is relevant to their work.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experimental evaluations** section. Here, the authors state that they used the **CMP facade database** for training, which contains 606 labeled building facade images. They also mention using a test dataset called **ICG Graz50** for evaluation, which is referenced in the context of comparing their method's performance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CMP Facade Database**:
   > Tylecek, R. (2012). *The CMP Facade Database*. Technical report, CTU–CMP–2012–24, Czech Technical University.

2. **ICG Graz50 Dataset**:
   > Riemenschneider, H., Krispel, U., Thaller, W., Donoser, M., Havemann, S., Fellner, D., & Bischof, H. (2012). *Irregular lattices for complex shape grammar facade parsing*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1640–1647.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
