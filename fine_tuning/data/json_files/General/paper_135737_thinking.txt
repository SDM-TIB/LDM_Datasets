To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Developmental Pretraining (DPT) for Image Classification Networks" by Niranjan Rajesh and Debayan Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their pre-training approach and the datasets used in different phases of their methodology. 

In **section 3 (Proposed DPT Regime)**, I will identify the datasets mentioned for each phase of the DPT approach:

1. **BIPEDv2 Dataset**: This dataset is used in Phase 1 for training the network on edge detection. The authors describe it as containing outdoor images with specific annotations. I will note the details provided, such as the number of training and testing images.

2. **Geometric 2D Shape Dataset**: This dataset is utilized in Phase 2 for shape recognition tasks. The authors specify that it consists of 9 classes of geometric shapes, with a substantial number of images per class.

3. **Imagenette Dataset**: This dataset is used for benchmarking the model after the pre-training phases. It is a subset of ImageNet and is mentioned in the context of evaluating the model's performance on real-world objects.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **BIPEDv2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xavier Soria, Angel Sappa, Patricio Humanante, and Arash Akbarinia. *Dense extreme inception network for edge detection*. Pattern Recognition, 139:109461, 2023.

- For the **Geometric 2D Shape Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A El Korchi. *2D geometric shapes dataset*. Mendeley Data, 1:2020, 2020.

- For the **Imagenette Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Howard. *Imagenette*.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
