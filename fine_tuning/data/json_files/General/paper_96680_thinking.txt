To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness Threats of Differential Privacy" by Nurislam Tursynbek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct experiments on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **MNIST** dataset, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

In the experimental study, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **MNIST Dataset**: Contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32 pixels, divided into 10 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
