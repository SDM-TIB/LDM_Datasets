To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correcting the Sub-Optimal Bit Allocation" by Tongda Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for empirical results or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations. For instance, if the authors mention using specific datasets to validate their proposed methods, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary details for anyone who may want to access the datasets for their own research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **UVG dataset**, I will look for the complete citation, which might look something like this:
> Alexandre Mercat, Marko Viitanen, and Jarno Vanne. *UVG Dataset: 50/120fps 4k sequences for video codec analysis and development*. In Proceedings of the 11th ACM Multimedia Systems Conference, pages 297â€“302, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately represented the datasets in a way that is easy to understand and useful for future reference, making sure to include all relevant citations for proper attribution.
