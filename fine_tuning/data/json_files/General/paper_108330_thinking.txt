To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Graph Collaborative Filtering with Neighborhood-enriched Contrastive Learning" by Zihan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted extensive experiments on five public datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section (4.1.1)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MovieLens-1M (ML-1M)**: This dataset is widely used in recommendation systems and contains user-item interaction data.
2. **Yelp**: A dataset that includes user reviews and ratings for businesses.
3. **Amazon Books**: This dataset consists of user interactions with books on Amazon.
4. **Gowalla**: A dataset that contains check-in data from the Gowalla location-based social network.
5. **Alibaba-iFashion**: A dataset related to fashion recommendations from Alibaba.

I will also check the **table (Table 1)** in the paper, which summarizes the statistics of these datasets, confirming their presence and providing additional details such as the number of users, items, and interaction density.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section or other relevant sections of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **MovieLens-1M**:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The movielens datasets: History and context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS), 5(4):1–19, 2015.

- **Yelp**:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- **Amazon Books**:
  > Julian McAuley and Jure Leskovec. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the 38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, pages 43–52, 2015.

- **Gowalla**:
  > Eunjoon Cho, Seth A. Myers, and Jure Leskovec. *Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks*. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pages 1082–1090, 2011.

- **Alibaba-iFashion**:
  > Wen Chen et al. *POG: personalized outfit generation for fashion recommendation at Alibaba iFashion*. In Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, pages 2662–2670, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
