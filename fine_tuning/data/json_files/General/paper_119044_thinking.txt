To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balanced Deep CCA for Bird Vocalization Detection" by Sumit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a dataset named **TwoRadioBirds** for bird vocalization detection, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 2)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **TwoRadioBirds** dataset. They mention that it contains accelerometer and microphone recordings of zebra finches, including specifics about the data collection process, the number of files, and the sampling rate. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details for citation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **TwoRadioBirds** dataset. The authors provide a DOI link for accessing the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, source, and DOI.

The citation for the **TwoRadioBirds** dataset is:
> Sumit Kumar, B. Anshuman, Linus RÃ¼ttimann, Richard H.R. Hahnloser, Vipul Arora. *TwoRadioBirds: A Dataset for Bird Vocalization Detection*. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7253729

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation. I will compile this into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Review the dataset section for detailed descriptions.
3. Locate the full citation in the references section.
4. Compile the dataset information and citation for output.

This methodical approach will ensure that I extract all necessary details about the dataset while maintaining proper citation practices.
