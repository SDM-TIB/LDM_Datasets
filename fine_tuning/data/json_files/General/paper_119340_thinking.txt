To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Bayesian Deep Learning on Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Tasks" by Neil Band et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors curated two publicly available datasets of high-resolution human retina images, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Data and Preprocessing** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **EyePACS Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing high-resolution labeled images of human retinas with varying degrees of diabetic retinopathy. It consists of 35,126 training images, 10,906 validation images, and 42,670 test images, with each image graded by a medical expert on a scale from 0 to 4.

2. **APTOS Dataset**: This dataset is used to assess model performance under distribution shift and contains labeled images of human retinas collected in India. It includes 3,662 images, with 80% used as a test set and 20% as a secondary validation set, also graded on the same scale as the EyePACS dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **EyePACS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > EyePACS. *Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset*, 2015.

- For the **APTOS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > APTOS. *APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Dataset*, 2019.

Now that I have the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
