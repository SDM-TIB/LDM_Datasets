To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Word length-aware text spotting: Enhancing detection and recognition in dense text image" by Hao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on public datasets and introduced a new dataset called **DSTD1500**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on several public datasets, including:

1. **SynthText 150k**: This dataset includes 94,723 multi-oriented straight text images and 54,327 curved text images, with word-level bounding boxes and annotations.
2. **ICDAR 2013**: A scene text dataset consisting of 229 training images and 233 test images.
3. **ICDAR 2015**: Contains 1,000 training images and 500 test images, annotated with multi-oriented text.
4. **Total-Text**: A benchmark for arbitrarily shaped scene text, using word-level polygonal boxes as annotations, with 1,255 images for training and 300 images for testing.
5. **CTW1500**: A scene text benchmark of any shape at the text line level, consisting of 1,000 training images and 500 test images.

The authors also introduce their own dataset, **DSTD1500**, which consists of 1,500 images captured from paper books, annotated with 75,471 instances of English text.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **SynthText 150k**, the citation is:

- For **ICDAR 2013**, the citation is:

- For **ICDAR 2015**, the citation is:

- For **CTW1500**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Jin, L., Zhang, S., Luo, C., & Zhang, S. (2019). *Curved Scene Text Detection via Transverse and Longitudinal Sequence Connection*. Pattern Recognition, 90, 337-345.

- For **DSTD1500**, since it is a new dataset introduced by the authors, the citation is:
  > Wang, H., Zhou, H., Zhang, Y., Lu, T., & Ma, J. (2023). *Word length-aware text spotting: Enhancing detection and recognition in dense text image*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
