To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sign-Perturbed Sums: A New System Identification Approach for Constructing Exact Non-Asymptotic Confidence Regions in Linear Regression Models" by Balázs Cs. Csáji, Marco C. Campi, and Erik Weyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new method for constructing confidence regions but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference various standard methods in system identification and mention the need for finite sample properties. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VII) where the authors describe their simulation examples. Here, they mention using a second-order FIR system and provide details about the data generation process. They describe the input signal and the noise characteristics but do not explicitly name any datasets.

I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or related works that might provide datasets. However, the references primarily consist of foundational texts and previous works in system identification, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper focuses on a methodological contribution rather than empirical results based on publicly available datasets, it appears that there are no specific datasets provided in this paper. The authors conduct simulations based on theoretical models rather than using external datasets.

In conclusion, I will note that while the paper discusses methods and simulations, it does not provide any named datasets for extraction. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are explicitly mentioned in the text.
