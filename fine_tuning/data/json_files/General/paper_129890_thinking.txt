To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Actor-agnostic Multi-label Action Recognition with Multi-modal Query" by Anindya Mondal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five publicly available benchmarks, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Thumos14**: A single-label dataset consisting of 13,000 videos across 20 classes, with specific splits for validation and testing.
2. **Hockey**: A multi-label dataset containing 12 activities across 36 videos.
3. **Charades**: A multi-label dataset with 66,500 annotations for 157 actions, divided into training and validation videos.
4. **Animal Kingdom**: A large multi-label dataset featuring over 50 hours of footage with 30,000 video sequences across various animal species.
5. **HMDB51**: A comprehensive dataset with 6,766 video clips spanning 51 action categories.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Thumos14**, the citation is:
  > Haroon Idrees, Amir R Zamir, Yu-Gang Jiang, Alex Gorban, Ivan Laptev, Rahul Sukthankar, and Mubarak Shah. *The thumos challenge on action recognition for videos “in the wild”*. CVIU, 2017.

- For **Hockey**, the citation is:
  > Konstantin Sozykin, Stanislav Protasov, Adil Khan, Rasheed Hussain, and Jooyoung Lee. *Multi-label class-imbalanced action recognition in hockey videos via 3d convolutional neural networks*. SNPD, 2018.

- For **Charades**, the citation is:
  > Gunnar A Sigurdsson, Gül Varol, Xiaolong Wang, Ali Farhadi, Ivan Laptev, and Abhinav Gupta. *Hollywood in homes: Crowdsourcing data collection for activity understanding*. ECCV, 2016.

- For **Animal Kingdom**, the citation is:
  > Xun Long Ng, Kian Eng Ong, Qichen Zheng, Yun Ni, Si Yong Yeo, and Jun Liu. *Animal kingdom: A large and diverse dataset for animal behavior understanding*. CVPR, 2022.

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Estíbaliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: a large video database for human motion recognition*. ICCV, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
