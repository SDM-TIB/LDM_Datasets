To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Depth-Supervised NeRF for Multi-View RGB-D Operating Room Videos" by Beerend G.A. Gerats et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, I will look for context regarding the datasets used, particularly any references to specific datasets that support the research claims. The introduction often sets the stage for the methodology and may mention datasets that are foundational to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 3.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **4D-OR dataset** from the Technical University of Munich, which contains RGB-D images and camera poses from simulated knee replacement surgeries. This section will provide detailed information about the dataset, including its purpose and structure.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the dataset's impact on their findings or any specific metrics related to the dataset's use. This can help confirm the dataset's relevance and application in their experiments.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the **4D-OR dataset**. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Özsoy, E., Örnek, E.P., Czempiel, T., Tombari, F., & Navab, N. (2022). *4D-OR: Semantic Scene Graphs for OR Domain Modeling*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the dataset, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: 4D-OR Dataset
   - **Description**: Contains RGB-D images and camera poses from ten simulated knee replacement surgeries, used to train the method in reconstructing five surgical phases.
   - **Citation**: Özsoy, E., Örnek, E.P., Czempiel, T., Tombari, F., & Navab, N. (2022). *4D-OR: Semantic Scene Graphs for OR Domain Modeling*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the dataset details and citations are accurately represented.
