To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lepton Flavour Violation Identification in Tau Decay (τ − → µ−µ−µ+) Using Artificial Intelligence" by Reymond Mesuga, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a combination of real data from the LHCb experiment and Monte Carlo simulated data, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection section** (II.A) where the author explicitly describes the dataset used in the study. The paper mentions that the dataset was provided by the "Flavours of Physics: Finding τ → µµµ competition on Kaggle." This is a clear indication of a specific dataset that I need to document.

In this section, the author describes the dataset as being suited for binary classification with target labels of "signal" and "background." It contains both Monte Carlo simulated data (signals) and real data from LHCb (background). The features are categorized into kinetic features and isolation variables, which provide context for the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for the dataset. The paper references the Kaggle competition, which is the source of the dataset. The citation for this dataset is:
> "Flavours of physics: Finding τ → µµµ," https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/flavours-of-physics/data, 2015.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
