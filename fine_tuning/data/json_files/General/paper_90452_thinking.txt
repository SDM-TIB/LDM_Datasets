To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Projection Pursuit Gaussian Process Regression" by Gecheng Chen and Rui Tuo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their simulations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or features.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Borehole function** as a test function in their experiments. I will note this down as it is a specific dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Borehole function. The citation is as follows:
> William V. Harper and Sumant K. Gupta. *Sensitivity/Uncertainty Analysis of A Borehole Scenario Comparing Latin Hypercube Sampling and Deterministic Sensitivity Approaches*. Office of Nuclear Waste Isolation, Battelle Memorial Institute, 1983.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the context of the simulation studies or comparisons with other methods. If the authors refer to any additional datasets, I will extract their names and descriptions in a similar manner.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me ensure that I do not miss any important details and that I provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
