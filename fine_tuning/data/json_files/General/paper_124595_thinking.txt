To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Autoencoders as Image Processors" by Huiyu Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses various image processing tasks and mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they evaluate their model on different tasks. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention several datasets used for different tasks:

1. **Urban100 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the model on image denoising tasks. It consists of 100 images with varying levels of noise.

2. **SIDD Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for real image denoising experiments. It contains high-quality images captured under various conditions, making it suitable for testing the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

3. **DND Dataset**: Similar to SIDD, this dataset is also used for real image denoising tasks and contains images taken in real-world conditions.

4. **GoPro Dataset**: This dataset is used for motion deblurring experiments. It consists of pairs of blurred and sharp images, allowing the model to learn how to recover sharp images from blurred inputs.

5. **DPDD Dataset**: This dataset is used for defocus deblurring tasks. It contains images with varying levels of defocus blur, providing a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance in this area.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Urban100 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **SIDD Dataset**, the citation is:

  > Abdullah Abuolaim and Michael S. Brown. *Defocus deblurring using dual-pixel data*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 111–126, 2020.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
