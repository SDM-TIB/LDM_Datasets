To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature-context driven Federated Meta-Learning for Rare Disease Prediction" by Bingyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of rare disease prediction and hints at the use of datasets from hospitals, which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Arrhythmia dataset** and a **medical image dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific metrics or features mentioned.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a description of the **Arrhythmia dataset**, stating that it contains 279 dimensional features and includes nine classes of diseases. They also mention the number of samples per class, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Arrhythmia dataset**, the citation is:
  > GB Moody, RG Mark. "The impact of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database." IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 45-50, 2001.

- For the **medical image dataset**, the citation is:
  > M Khoury, R Valdez. "Rare diseases, genomics and public health: an expanding intersection." Genomics and Health Impact Blog, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
