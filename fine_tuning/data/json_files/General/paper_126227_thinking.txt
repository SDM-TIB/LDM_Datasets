To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DBAT: Dynamic Backward Attention Transformer for Material Segmentation with Cross-Resolution Patches" by Yuwen Heng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the DBAT is evaluated on two datasets, which indicates that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment Setting)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they describe:

1. **Local Material Database (LMD)**: This dataset consists of 5,845 low-resolution images that have been manually labeled with 16 mutually exclusive material classes. It is crucial to note the challenges associated with this dataset, such as sparsely labeled segments.

2. **OpenSurfaces**: This dataset contains 25,352 high-resolution indoor images labeled with 45 material categories. The authors also mention the sparsity and coarseness of the labels in this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For the **Local Material Database (LMD)**, the citation is:
> Schwartz, G., & Nishino, K. (2020). Recognizing material properties from images. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 42(8), 1981-1995.

For **OpenSurfaces**, the citation is:
> Bell, S., Upchurch, P., Snavely, N., & Bala, K. (2013). OpenSurfaces: A richly annotated catalog of surface appearance. *ACM Transactions on Graphics (SIGGRAPH)*, 32(4).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the datasets referenced in the paper.
