To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-Trans2Cap: Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer using Transformer for 3D Dense Captioning" by Zhihao Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, **ScanRefer** and **Nr3D**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **ScanRefer Dataset**: This dataset annotates 800 3D indoor scenes in the ScanNet dataset with 51,583 language queries. It follows the official ScanNet splits and contains 36,665, 9,508, and 5,410 samples in the train, validation, and test sets, respectively.

2. **Nr3D Dataset**: The Natural Reference in 3D (Nr3D) dataset has the same train/val split as ScanRefer and contains 41,503 queries annotated by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. It is noted to be more challenging than ScanRefer due to the absence of fixed or redundant sentence patterns.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ScanRefer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dave Zhenyu Chen, Angel X Chang, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanRefer: 3D Object Localization in RGB-D Scans Using Natural Language*. In Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For the **Nr3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Panos Achlioptas, Ahmed Abdelreheem, Fei Xia, Mohamed Elhoseiny, and Leonidas Guibas. *ReferIt3D: Neural Listeners for Fine-Grained 3D Object Identification in Real-World Scenes*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 422–440. Springer, 2020.

Now that I have the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further processing or review.
