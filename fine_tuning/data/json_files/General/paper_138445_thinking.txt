To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TCI-Former: Thermal Conduction-Inspired Transformer for Infrared Small Target Detection" by Tianxiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and mentions experiments conducted on two datasets, which is a good starting point.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of infrared small target detection and reference previous works that may have used datasets. However, I need to focus on the specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they used **NUAA-SIRST** and **IRSTD-1k** for their experiments. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of images and their characteristics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For **NUAA-SIRST**, the citation is:
   > Dai, Y.; Wu, Y.; Zhou, F.; and Barnard, K. 2021a. Asymmetric contextual modulation for infrared small target detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 950–959.

2. For **IRSTD-1k**, the citation is:
   > Zhang, M.; Wu, Q.; Guo, J.; Li, Y.; and Gao, X. 2022d. ISNet: Shape Matters for Infrared Small Target Detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 877–886.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

- **NUAA-SIRST**: Contains 427 infrared images of various sizes.
- **IRSTD-1k**: Consists of 1,000 real infrared images, each sized 512 × 512.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
