To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Partially Reversible U-Net for Memory-Efficient Volumetric Image Segmentation" by Robin Brügger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions demonstrating results on the **BraTS challenge dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this case, the authors explicitly mention the **BraTS 2018 dataset** in the **training procedure** subsection of the methods section. This confirms that this dataset is used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather details about the **BraTS 2018 dataset**. The paper states that they implemented their method on this dataset and provides some context about its use in the experiments. However, I need to ensure I have the full citation for this dataset.

To find the full citation, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the BraTS dataset is as follows:
> Menze, B.H., et al. "The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)." IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 34(10), 1993–2024 (Oct 2015).

Since the paper primarily discusses the BraTS dataset, I will focus on this single dataset for extraction.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation in the appropriate format. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive representation of the dataset used in the research.
