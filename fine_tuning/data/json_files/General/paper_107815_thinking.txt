To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-Based Vandalism Detection in OpenStreetMap" by Nicolas Tempelmeier and Elena Demidova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a dataset of real-world vandalism incidents from OpenStreetMap (OSM) edit history, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. They mention two datasets:

1. **OSM-Reverts**: This dataset includes over 18,000 training examples of real-world vandalism incidents extracted from the OSM edit history from 2014 to 2019. It consists of both vandalism changesets and non-vandalism changesets, allowing for the training of supervised machine learning models.

2. **OSM-Manual**: This smaller dataset contains approximately 2,018 manually identified vandalism incidents by the OSM community in 2018, including spam and forbidden imports. It is used only as a test set due to its limited size.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are original contributions by the authors, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the OSM-Reverts dataset is available as open data for further research, as mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will summarize the findings for each dataset:

- For **OSM-Reverts**, the dataset is described as follows:
  > OSM-Reverts: A dataset containing over 18,276 training examples of real-world vandalism incidents extracted from the OSM edit history from 2014 to 2019. It includes both vandalism and non-vandalism changesets and is available as open data for reproducibility and further research.

- For **OSM-Manual**, the dataset is described as follows:
  > OSM-Manual: A dataset consisting of approximately 2,018 manually identified vandalism incidents from the OSM community in 2018, used solely as a test set.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for review or downstream processing, ensuring that I include the necessary details about each dataset as outlined in the paper.
