To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Nearest Neighbors for Visual Classification" by Menglin Jia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of k-NN classifiers and their integration with neural networks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In **Section 4.1 (Evaluation protocols and details)**, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments. I will note down the datasets mentioned:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image recognition tasks, containing 1,281,167 training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes.
2. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200-2011)**: A dataset for fine-grained bird species recognition, containing 11,788 images across 200 classes.
3. **Oxford Flowers**: A dataset for fine-grained flower species recognition, containing 8,189 images across 102 classes.
4. **Stanford Dogs**: A dataset for fine-grained dog species recognition, containing 20,580 images across 120 breeds.
5. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained car detection, containing 16,185 images across 196 classes.
6. **Natural World Tasks (NeWT)**: A collection of 196 binary classification tasks related to various aspects of natural world images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
