To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cross Attention-guided Dense Network for Images Fusion" by Zhengwen Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments have been carried out on publicly available datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list five publicly available datasets:

1. **TNO Dataset**: Used for visible and infrared image fusion tasks. The authors mention that this dataset is used for training and testing, with specific numbers of image pairs provided.

2. **RoadScene Dataset**: Another dataset used for testing in the visible and infrared image fusion tasks. The authors provide a link to the dataset.

3. **MFF Dataset**: Utilized for multi-exposure image fusion tasks. The authors also provide a link for this dataset.

4. **SICE Dataset**: Similar to the MFF dataset, this is used for multi-exposure image fusion tasks, with a link provided.

5. **MRI and PET Datasets**: These datasets are used for medical image fusion tasks. The authors provide a link to the datasets.

6. **Lytro Dataset**: Used for multi-focus image fusion tasks, with a link provided.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. For example, the TNO dataset citation might look like this:

- For the **TNO Dataset**:
  > "TNO Image Fusion Dataset." Available at: http://figshare.com/articles/TNOImageFusionDataset/1008029.

- For the **RoadScene Dataset**:
  > "RoadScene Dataset." Available at: https://github.com/hanna-xu/RoadScene.

- For the **MFF Dataset**:
  > "MFF Dataset." Available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders.

- For the **MRI and PET Datasets**:
  > "MRI and PET Datasets." Available at: http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/home.html.

- For the **Lytro Dataset**:
  > "Lytro Dataset." Available at: https://github.com/sametaymaz/Multi-focus-Image-Fusion-Dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
