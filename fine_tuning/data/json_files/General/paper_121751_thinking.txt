To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Self-Distillation in the Presence of Label Noise" by Rudrajit Das and Sujay Sanghavi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." 

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the dataset characteristics, such as size, type, and any specific attributes relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR-100 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

If the paper mentions other datasets, such as **Caltech-256** or **Food-101**, I will similarly locate their citations in the references section.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
