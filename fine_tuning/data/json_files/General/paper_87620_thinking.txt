To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Secret Revealer: Generative Model-Inversion Attacks Against Deep Neural Networks" by Yuheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is a well-known collection of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. It is commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **Chest X-ray Database (ChestX-ray8)**: This dataset contains chest X-ray images and is used for the classification and localization of common thoracic diseases. It is a large-scale dataset that includes images from various patients.

3. **CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)**: This dataset contains 202,599 face images of 10,177 identities, with annotations for various attributes. It is widely used in facial recognition and attribute prediction tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann Lecun, Leon Bottou, Y Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86:2278 – 2324, 12 1998.

- For **ChestX-ray8**, the citation is:
  > Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, and Ronald M. Summers. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 2097–2106, 2017.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision, pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
