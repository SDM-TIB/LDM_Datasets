To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Wise Attention (DWAtt): A Layer Fusion Method for Data-Efficient Classification" by Muhammad ElNokrashy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions comparing DWAtt to other methods on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Tasks, Datasets, and Raised Questions)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CoNLL-03**: This dataset is described as a mainstream Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmark in English, with specific details about the training and development set sizes.

2. **WikiAnn**: This is a multilingual NER benchmark used to test the effect of resource availability in the pretraining phase. The authors provide details about the training set sizes for different languages.

3. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and is described as a subset of the English Wikipedia, with specific details about its content.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CoNLL-03**, the citation is:

- For **WikiAnn**, the citation is:

- For **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2017). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. ArXiv, abs/1609.07843.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
