To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Complete Cross-triplet Loss in Label Space for Audio-visual Cross-modal Retrieval" by Donghuo Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly named or described. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **two audio-visual double-checked datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they specifically mention:

1. **VEGAS Dataset**: This dataset is described as a subset of the Google AudioSet, which has been cleaned using Amazon Mechanical Turk to ensure that the manually annotated events appear in both audio and visual tracks. The dataset contains 28,103 videos, with each video ranging from 2 to 10 seconds in length.

2. **AVE Dataset**: This dataset contains 15 events and includes 1,955 videos with audio-visual tracks. The authors specify that 1,564 videos are used for training and 391 for testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **VEGAS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Donghuo Zeng, Yi Yu, and Keizo Oyama. *Deep triplet neural networks with cluster-cca for audio-visual cross-modal retrieval*. ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications (TOMM), 16(3):pp.1–23, 2020.

- For the **AVE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yapeng Tian, Jing Shi, Bochen Li, Zhiyao Duan, and Chenliang Xu. *Audio-visual event localization in unconstrained videos*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages pp.252–268, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
