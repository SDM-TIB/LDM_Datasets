To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CPM R-CNN: Calibrating Point-guided Misalignment in Object Detection" by Bin Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluations on the **COCO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in **section 4 (Experiments)**. Here, they mention that their framework was evaluated on the **MS COCO dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the field of object detection.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, David Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014, pp. 740–755.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for its experiments, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured output ready for review or further processing.
