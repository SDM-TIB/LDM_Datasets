To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Early Sepsis Prediction with Multi Modal Learning" by Fred Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research. I will note this down as a key dataset.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In the **dataset and training pipeline** section, the authors provide a detailed description of the **MIMIC-III dataset**, including its contents and the context in which it is used. They mention that it consists of health data associated with roughly 60,000 ICU admissions, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and relevance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, H. Lehman Li-Wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the key details about the **MIMIC-III dataset**:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset includes de-identified health data associated with approximately 60,000 ICU admissions. It contains demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, nursing/clinician notes, and more. The data was compiled from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, MA, between 2001 and 2012.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
