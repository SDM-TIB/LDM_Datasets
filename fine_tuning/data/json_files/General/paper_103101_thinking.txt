To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Query Embedding Pruning for Dense Retrieval" by Nicola Tonellotto and Craig Macdonald, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on the **MSMARCO passage ranking corpus**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **MSMARCO passage ranking dataset** for their experiments. I will need to gather details about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics as described in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide context for the **MSMARCO passage ranking dataset**, noting that it consists of queries with relevance assessments. They mention using the official small version of the dataset, which contains 6,980 queries with an average of 1.1 judgements per query, as well as the TREC 2019 query set, which contains 43 queries with an average of 215.3 judgements per query. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MSMARCO dataset**. The citation for the MSMARCO dataset is typically attributed to the original authors who created it. I will look for the relevant reference that discusses the dataset in detail.

The citation for the **MSMARCO dataset** is:
> Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych. *Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 3982â€“3992, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **MSMARCO passage ranking dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify datasets.
2. Locating the datasets section or relevant mentions in the experiments section.
3. Collecting details about the **MSMARCO passage ranking dataset**.
4. Finding the full citation in the references section.

With this information, I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
