To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Leveraging In-the-Wild Data for Effective Self-Supervised Pretraining in Speaker Recognition" by Shuai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **WenetSpeech dataset** for self-supervised pretraining and the **CNCeleb dataset** for supervised finetuning, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **WenetSpeech**: This dataset is described as an open-source ASR corpus containing over 10,000 hours of Mandarin data collected from various sources, including YouTube and Podcasts. It serves as a large-scale in-the-wild dataset for DINO-based self-supervised pretraining.

2. **CNCeleb**: The authors mention that they merge the development sets of CNCeleb1 and CNCeleb2 to create the final training set (CNCeleb-Train) and use the standard CNCeleb test set for evaluation (CNCeleb-Eval). This dataset is crucial for the supervised finetuning process.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WenetSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Binbin Zhang, Hang Lv, Pengcheng Guo, Qijie Shao, Chao Yang, Lei Xie, Xin Xu, Hui Bu, Xiaoyu Chen, Chenchen Zeng, Di Wu, and Zhendong Peng. *WenetSpeech: A 10000+ hours multi-domain Mandarin corpus for speech recognition*. In ICASSP 2022. IEEE, 2022.

- For **CNCeleb**, the citation is:
  > Yue Fan, JW Kang, LT Li, KC Li, HL Chen, ST Cheng, PY Zhang, ZY Zhou, YQ Cai, and Dong Wang. *Cn-celeb: a challenging chinese speaker recognition dataset*. In ICASSP 2020. IEEE, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
