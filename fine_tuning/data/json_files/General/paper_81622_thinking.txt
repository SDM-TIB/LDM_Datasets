To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Stylish Image Description Generation via Domain Layer Norm" by Cheng-Kuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss their approach and the datasets they utilize. They mention using a paired unstylish image description corpus and a monolingual corpus of specific styles. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection on datasets or any mention of datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors specifically mention using the **VG-Para dataset** as the source domain dataset and various collections from **BookCorpus** for the target styles, including humor and romance novels, as well as fairy tales and country song lyrics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **VG-Para Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krause, J., Johnson, J., Krishna, R., & Fei-Fei, L. (2017). A hierarchical approach for generating descriptive image paragraphs. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **BookCorpus**: The citation is:
   > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention collecting country song lyrics from Kaggle, but they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references. Therefore, I will acknowledge it as a dataset used but without a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly and that the full citations are included for those that have them. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
