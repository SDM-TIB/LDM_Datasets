To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Practical Sharpness-Aware Minimization Cannot Converge All the Way to Optima" by Dongkuk Si and Chulhee Yun, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the dataset names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

If the paper includes a **table or figure** summarizing the datasets, I will pay close attention to that as it often contains concise information about each dataset.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted dataset information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
