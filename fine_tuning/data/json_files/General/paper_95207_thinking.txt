To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label-Aware Neural Tangent Kernel: Toward Better Generalization and Local Elasticity" by Shuxiao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of two label-aware kernels, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments that validate these kernels.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. They mention that they conducted comprehensive experiments to confirm that their proposed label-aware NTKs can better simulate the behaviors of neural networks compared to their label-agnostic counterparts. This indicates that CIFAR-10 is a key dataset used in their research.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **conclusion sections**. However, the primary focus seems to be on CIFAR-10, as it is referenced multiple times throughout the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation for CIFAR-10 is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

After confirming the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format. The only dataset extracted from this paper is:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant dataset information from the research paper.
