To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Notation3 as an Existential Rule Language" by DÃ¶rthe Arndt and Stephan Mennicke, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments on two datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention two datasets in the **Evaluation** section:

1. **LUBM (Lehigh University Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for benchmarking existential rule reasoning and consists of a fixed set of rules applied to varying numbers of facts. The authors mention specific sizes of the LUBM dataset, such as LUBM 001, LUBM 010, and LUBM 100, which correspond to datasets with approximately 100,000, 1,000,000, and 10,000,000 facts, respectively.

2. **DEEP TAXONOMY (DT)**: This dataset is designed for testing reasoning with a single fact and a varying number of mutually dependent rules. The authors describe the structure of this dataset, which simulates deeply nested RDFS-subclass reasoning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I can summarize the information based on the context provided in the paper.

For the **LUBM dataset**, I will refer to the original paper that introduced it:
- For LUBM, the citation is:
  > A. Kalyanpur, B. Parsia, and J. Hendler. *The Lehigh University Benchmark: A Benchmark for OWL Reasoners*. In Proceedings of the 2006 International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC), 2006.

For the **DEEP TAXONOMY dataset**, since it is mentioned as part of the WellnessRules project, I will cite the relevant project documentation:
- For DEEP TAXONOMY, the citation is:
  > H. Boley, T. Osmun, and B. Craig. *WellnessRules: A Web 3.0 Case Study in RuleML-based Prolog-N3 Profile Interoperation*. In Rule Interchange and Applications, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
