To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Communication Efficient Distributed Learning with Censored, Quantized, and Generalized Group ADMM" by Chaouki Ben Issaid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its applications, which may hint at the datasets used for validation.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical results section**, particularly where the authors discuss the experiments conducted. In this section, they mention using several datasets for their simulations. Specifically, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, their characteristics, and the tasks they are associated with.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned in **Table I** of the numerical results section:

1. **synth-linear**: This dataset is synthetic and used for linear regression tasks. It has a model size of 1200 and consists of 50 instances.
2. **Body Fat**: This is a real dataset used for linear regression tasks, with a model size of 252 and 14 instances.
3. **synth-logistic**: Another synthetic dataset, this one is used for logistic regression tasks, with a model size of 1200 and 50 instances.
4. **Derm**: This real dataset is also used for logistic regression tasks, with a model size of 358 and 34 instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The references may provide the necessary details to properly cite each dataset.

- For the **synth-linear** and **synth-logistic** datasets, the authors refer to datasets generated in a previous work, specifically [19]. The citation is:
  > T. Chen, G. Giannakis, T. Sun, and W. Yin. "LAG: Lazily aggregated gradient for communication-efficient distributed learning." In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 31, 2018, pp. 5050â€“5060.

- For the **Body Fat** dataset, the citation is:
  > D. Dua and C. Graff. "UCI machine learning repository," 2017. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

- For the **Derm** dataset, the citation is also:
  > D. Dua and C. Graff. "UCI machine learning repository," 2017. Available: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will include its name, task, data type, model size, number of instances, and the full citation.
