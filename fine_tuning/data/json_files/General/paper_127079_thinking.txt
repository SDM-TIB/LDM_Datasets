To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kanbun-LM: Reading and Translating Classical Chinese in Japanese Methods by Language Models" by Hao Wang, Hirofumi Shimizu, and Daisuke Kawahara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors constructed the **first Classical-Chinese-to-Kanbun dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Our Dataset and Tasks)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they constructed. They mention that the dataset consists of original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts. They specifically reference **Tangshixuan (Selection of Tang Poems)** as the largest resource used to create their dataset, which contains 465 poems.

In this section, the authors also describe the dataset's structure and how they processed the data, which is crucial for understanding its contents and potential applications.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tangshixuan dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is:
> Tangshixuan. *Selection of Tang Poems*. Available at: https://kanbun.info/syubu/toushisen000.html

Since this is a web resource, I will ensure to format it correctly as a citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Classical-Chinese-to-Kanbun Dataset**: This dataset is the first of its kind, constructed to address the lack of Kanbun language resources. It includes original ancient Chinese texts, Japanese reading orders, and Kanbun texts, derived from the Tangshixuan resource.

2. **Tangshixuan**: The dataset consists of 465 poems, and the authors used a group shuffle split to ensure that all sentences in one poem would not be split.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Tangshixuan dataset as part of the output.
