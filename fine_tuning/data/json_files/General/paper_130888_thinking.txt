To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Framework for Spleen Volume Estimation from 2D Cross-sectional Views" by Zhen Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "149 manual segmentations of computed tomography (CT) volumes," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of segmentations from two publicly available collections:

1. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes 60 spleen segmentations from 40 3D CT volumes, with manual segmentations performed by a radiologist. The authors specify that this dataset is sourced from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre.

2. **Gibson et al. Dataset**: This dataset comprises 90 CT volumes with manual segmentations of multiple abdominal organs, including the spleen. It is a combination of data from the Cancer Imaging Archive Pancreas-CT dataset and the 'Beyond the Cranial Vault' segmentation challenge.

In the **data description**, the authors clarify that they used only the corresponding spleen segmentations from these datasets, not the original CT volumes. This is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Antonelli, M., Reinke, A., Bakas, S., Farahani, K., Kopp-Schneider, B., Landman, B. A., Litjens, G., Menze, B., Ronneberger, O., Summers, R. M., et al. (2022). The medical segmentation decathlon. *Nature Communications*, 13(1), 4128.

- For the **Gibson et al. Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gibson, E., Giganti, F., Hu, Y., Bonmati, E., Bandula, S., Gurusamy, K., Davidson, B., Pereira, S. P., Clarkson, M. J., & Barratt, D. C. (2018). Automatic multi-organ segmentation on abdominal CT with dense V-networks. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 37(8), 1822-1834.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
