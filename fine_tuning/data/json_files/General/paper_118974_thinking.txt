To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ConvFormer: Combining CNN and Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation" by Pengfei Gu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Lymph Node Segmentation Ultrasound Dataset**: This is an in-house dataset for segmenting lymph nodes in 2D ultrasound images, containing 137 training and 100 test images.

2. **2017 MM-WHS CT Dataset**: This public dataset is used for segmenting seven cardiac structures and contains 20 unpaired 3D CT images, split into 16 for training and 4 for testing.

3. **2017 ISIC Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset**: This public dataset is for segmenting lesion boundaries in 2D dermoscopic images, containing 2000 training, 150 validation, and 600 test images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **2017 ISIC Skin Lesion Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, N. C., Gutman, D., Celebi, M. E., Helba, B., Marchetti, M. A., Dusza, S. W., Kalloo, A., Liopyris, N., Mishra, N., Kittler, H., & Halpern, A. (2018). Skin lesion analysis toward melanoma detection: A challenge at the 2017 international symposium on biomedical imaging (ISBI), hosted by the international skin imaging collaboration (ISIC). In IEEE, ISBI, 2018, pp. 168–172.

- For the **2017 MM-WHS CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhuang, X., & Shen, J. (2016). Multi-scale patch and multi-modality atlases for whole heart segmentation of MRI. Medical Image Analysis, 31, 77–87.

- The **Lymph Node Segmentation Ultrasound Dataset** is an in-house dataset, so it does not have a formal citation like the public datasets.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
