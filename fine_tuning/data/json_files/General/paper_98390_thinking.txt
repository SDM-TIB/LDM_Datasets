To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Learning with a Structural Recurrent Neural Network for Short-Term Traffic Prediction" by Youngjoo Kim, Peng Wang, and Lyudmila Mihaylova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use real traffic speed data from the city of Santander, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the importance of traffic data and mention that the traffic data is obtained from magnetic induction loop detectors. This reinforces the idea that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

In **section IV (Validation with Real Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they use traffic speed data gathered in the city of Santander during the year 2016. They mention that this data is part of the case studies of the SETA EU project, which provides a clear identification of the dataset.

I will also look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its structure or how it was collected. The authors mention that the traffic speed measurements are aggregated every 15 minutes and that missing measurements are masked with averages from other days. This gives me insight into the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- **SETA EU Project**: 
  > SETA EU Project, A ubiquitous data and service ecosystem for better metropolitan mobility, Horizon 2020 Programme, 2016. Available: http://setamobility.weebly.com/.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Traffic Speed Data from Santander**: This dataset consists of traffic speed measurements collected from magnetic loop detectors in the city of Santander, Spain, during the year 2016. The data is aggregated every 15 minutes, and any missing measurements are filled in with averages from the same time on other days. The dataset is part of the SETA EU project.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing.
