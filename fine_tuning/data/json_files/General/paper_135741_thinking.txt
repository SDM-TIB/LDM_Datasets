To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaffold-GS: Structured 3D Gaussians for View-Adaptive Rendering" by Tao Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's performance across multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention testing their method on **27 scenes from publicly available datasets**, specifically highlighting datasets such as **Mip-NeRF360**, **Tanks&Temples**, **Deep Blending**, **BungeeNeRF**, and **VR-NeRF**. 

I will then check the **supplementary material** for any additional details regarding the datasets, including how they were prepared and any specific characteristics that might be relevant for documentation.

After identifying the datasets, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution. For example, the Mip-NeRF360 dataset is cited as:
> Jonathan T. Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Dor Verbin, Pratul P. Srinivasan, and Peter Hedman. *Mip-nerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields*. CVPR, 2022.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring that I have the correct and complete references.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, detailing each dataset's name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
