To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Greenhouse Gases" by Shalin Shah, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions using monthly GHG data and predicting temperature anomalies, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3.1 (The Data and Packages)**, where the author lists the sources of the data used in the analysis. Here, I will find explicit mentions of datasets:

1. **Global Temperature Data**: The temperature anomaly data is sourced from NASA's climate website. This is a crucial dataset for the analysis.
   - Citation: NASA. *Global Temperature*. Available at: https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/.

2. **Greenhouse Gas Data**: The GHG data is taken from the Mauna Loa Observatory, which is essential for understanding CO2 and CH4 levels.
   - Citation: NOAA. *Greenhouse Gas Data*. Available at: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/.

3. **CO2 Emissions Data**: This dataset is sourced from a global fossil CO2 emissions database, which is important for the emissions analysis.
   - Citation: DataHub. *Global Fossil CO2 Emissions*. Available at: https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-global.

4. **CMIP5 Data**: The author mentions that other data is available from the ESGF node, which may include various climate models.
   - Citation: ESGF. *CMIP5 Data*. Available at: https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip5/.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their relevance to the research and how they contribute to the findings presented in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset, ensuring that they are formatted correctly and ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
