To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstructing Robot Operations via Radio-Frequency Side-Channel" by Ryan Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fingerprinting robot movements and operational workflows, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Attack Methodology)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention the creation of a **movement dataset** that is split into two subsets:

1. The first subset contains samples of robot movements along the X, Y, and Z axes with varying speeds and distances. This subset is crucial for understanding how individual movements are captured and classified.

2. The second subset includes samples of manufacturing workflows, such as pick-and-place and push/pull operations, which are replicated from existing industrial robot datasets. The authors specifically reference the **Forward Dynamics Dataset Using KUKA LWR and Baxter** and the **Inverse Dynamics Dataset Using KUKA** as sources for these workflows.

In **section 3.1.2 (Movement Dataset)**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of samples and the types of movements captured. They mention approximately **7.8K samples for individual movements** and **~400 samples for warehousing workflows**.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

- For the **Forward Dynamics Dataset Using KUKA LWR and Baxter**, the citation is:
  > Athanasios S Polydoros and Lazaros Nalpantidis. *A reservoir computing approach for learning forward dynamics of industrial manipulators*. In 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS). IEEE, 612–618, 2016.

- For the **Inverse Dynamics Dataset Using KUKA**, the citation is:
  > Elmar Rueckert, Moritz Nakatenus, Samuele Tosatto, and Jan Peters. *Learning inverse dynamics models in O(n) time with LSTM networks*. In 2017 IEEE-RAS 17th International Conference on Humanoid Robotics (Humanoids). IEEE, 811–816, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
