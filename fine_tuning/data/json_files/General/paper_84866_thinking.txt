To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Pretrained Embeddings, Attention Mechanism and NCRF" by Anton A. Emelyanov and Ekaterina Artemova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on a dataset from the BSNLP shared task, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Task Description)**, where the authors mention that the dataset consists of texts in Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, and Russian languages, specifically for the BSNLP 2019 Shared Task. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's multilingual nature.

In **section 4 (Training the System)**, the authors specify that they divided the input data into two parts: the training set named "brexit" and the development set named "asia bibi." This gives me the names of the specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the BSNLP shared task dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **BSNLP 2019 Shared Task dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jakub Piskorski, Laska Laskova, Micha Marciczuk, Lidia Pivovarova, Pavel Pib, Josef Steinberger, and Roman Yangarber. *The second cross-lingual challenge on recognition, classification, lemmatization, and linking of named entities across Slavic languages*. In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Dataset Name**: BSNLP 2019 Shared Task dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of texts in Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, and Russian languages, used for the multilingual named entity recognition task.
   - **Citation**: Jakub Piskorski, Laska Laskova, Micha Marciczuk, Lidia Pivovarova, Pavel Pib, Josef Steinberger, and Roman Yangarber. *The second cross-lingual challenge on recognition, classification, lemmatization, and linking of named entities across Slavic languages*. In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing, Florence, Italy. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

2. **Dataset Name**: Brexit (training set)
   - **Description**: A subset of the BSNLP dataset used for training, focused on the topic of Brexit.
   - **Citation**: Same as above, as it is part of the BSNLP dataset.

3. **Dataset Name**: Asia Bibi (development set)
   - **Description**: Another subset of the BSNLP dataset used for development, focused on the topic of Asia Bibi.
   - **Citation**: Same as above, as it is part of the BSNLP dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
