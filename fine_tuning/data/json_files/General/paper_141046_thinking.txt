To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FH-SSTNet: Forehead Creases based User Verification using Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network" by Geetanjali Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the importance of biometric traits and mention forehead creases as a unique biometric trait. However, the specific dataset details are likely to be found in the **experiments section**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the FH-V1 dataset. They state that it comprises **4,964 image samples from 247 subjects**, with each subject contributing images captured during two sessions. This section confirms that the FH-V1 dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FH-V1 dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Bharadwaj et al. that introduced the dataset. The citation is as follows:

- Bharadwaj, R., Jaswal, G., Nigam, A., & Tiwari, K. (2022). *Mobile based human identification using forehead creases: Application and assessment under covid-19 masked face scenarios*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, 2022, pp. 3693â€“3701.

Since the FH-V1 dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the FH-V1 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
