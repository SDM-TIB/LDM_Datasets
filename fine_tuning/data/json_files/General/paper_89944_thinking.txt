To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimally adaptive Bayesian spectral density estimation for stationary and nonstationary processes" by Nick James and Max Menzies, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically details the datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention using two canonical datasets: **sunspots** and **airline passenger data**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their significance in the context of the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For the **sunspots dataset**, the citation is:
> Choudhuri, N. (2004). Bayesian estimation of the spectral density of a time series. *Journal of the American Statistical Association*, 99(468), 1050â€“1059. DOI: 10.1198/016214504000000557.

For the **airline passenger data**, the citation is:
> Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., & Ljung, G.M. (2015). *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control*. Wiley.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
