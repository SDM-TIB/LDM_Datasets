To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Doctor Recommendation in Online Health Forums via Expertise Learning" by Xiaoxin Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that a large-scale dataset was collected from Chunyu Yisheng, a Chinese online health forum, which suggests that this is a primary dataset used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection and Analysis section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that they gathered a dataset with **119K patient-doctor dialogues involving 359 doctors from 14 departments**. This is a significant dataset that will be included in my extraction.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **experiments or results sections**. However, the paper primarily discusses the dataset collected from Chunyu Yisheng, and no other datasets are explicitly mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from Chunyu Yisheng, I will cite it as follows:

- **Chunyu Yisheng Dataset**: 
  > Xiaoxin Lu, Yubo Zhang, Jing Li, and Shi Zong. *Doctor Recommendation in Online Health Forums via Expertise Learning*. In Proceedings of the ACL 2022, pages XX-XX, 2022. Available at: https://github.com/polyusmart/Doctor-Recommendation

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for output, ensuring it is structured correctly for any downstream processing or review.
