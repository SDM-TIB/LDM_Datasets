To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Can the Neural Tangent Kernel Tell Us About Adversarial Robustness?" by Nikolaos Tsilivis and Julia Kempe, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses adversarial examples and the use of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the models. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets such as **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** for their experiments. 

In the **experiments section**, they describe the architecture and training procedures, indicating that they trained models on these datasets. They also mention specific tasks related to these datasets, such as binary classification tasks extracted from CIFAR-10 (car vs. airplane).

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
