To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sarcasm Detection in Twitter - Performance Impact while using Data Augmentation: Word Embeddings" by Alif Tri Handoyo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their technique on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using four datasets for sarcasm detection: **iSarcasm**, **Ghosh**, **Ptacek**, and **SemEval-18**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the statistics of the datasets, including the number of samples and the proportion of sarcastic texts. This table will help me understand the datasets' sizes and their balance regarding sarcastic versus non-sarcastic content.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The relevant citations from the paper are:

1. **iSarcasm Dataset**:
   > Oprea, S., & Magdy, W. (2021). *iSarcasm: A Dataset of Intended Sarcasm*. arXiv.org. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03123. [Accessed: 12-Aug-2021].

2. **Ghosh Dataset**:
   > Ghosh, A., & Veale, T. (2016). *Fracking sarcasm using neural network*. In Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis (pp. 161–169).

3. **Ptacek Dataset**:

4. **SemEval-18 Dataset**:
   > Van Hee, C., Lefever, E., & Hoste, V. (2018). *SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 39–50).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
