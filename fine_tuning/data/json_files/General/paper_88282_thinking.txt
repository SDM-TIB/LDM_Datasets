To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Arbitrary Quantities of Interest from Expensive Black-Box Functions through Bayesian Sequential Optimal Design" by Piyush Pandita et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their work. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include datasets that are foundational to the study.

I will then examine the **methodology section** closely, as it typically details the experimental setup and may explicitly list the datasets used for training, testing, or validation. If the authors describe any experiments, I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets. This section may provide additional context or confirm the datasets mentioned earlier.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will review it thoroughly, as it will likely contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Dataset A," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I will search for the original source of the dataset based on the information given in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, and include the full citation for each dataset as found in the references.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
