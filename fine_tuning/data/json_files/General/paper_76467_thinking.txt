To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstruction of Training Samples from Loss Functions" by Akiyoshi Sannai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Methodology," or "Datasets."** These sections usually detail the datasets used for experiments or analyses. If the paper includes a dedicated section for datasets, I will focus on that to find specific names and descriptions.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. If the paper discusses how these datasets were used in experiments, I will also document that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I may need to conduct a brief search for the datasets online to find their original sources and obtain the necessary citation information.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile it into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes all necessary citation details.
