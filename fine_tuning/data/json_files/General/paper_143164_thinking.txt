To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ASPIRE: Iterative Amortized Posterior Inference for Bayesian Inverse Problems" by Rafael Orozco et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the validation of the method on a "high-dimensional and nonlinear transcranial medical imaging problem with ultrasound," which suggests that there may be datasets related to this application.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Medical wave-based imaging)**, where the authors describe the transcranial ultrasound computed tomography (TUCT) problem. Here, they mention the use of a dataset created based on the multi-subject FASTMRI dataset, which is crucial for understanding the acoustic velocity parameters of human brains.

In **section 4.2.1 (Brain prior samples)**, the authors explicitly state that they created a custom dataset comprising 1,000 diverse acoustic velocity parameters collected from different human patients. This dataset is essential for the training of their model and is referred to as the "custom dataset based off the multi-subject FASTMRI dataset."

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **FASTMRI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zbontar, J., Knoll, F., Sriram, A., Murrell, T., Huang, Z., Muckley, M. J., Defazio, A., Stern, R., Johnson, P., Bruno, M., et al. (2018). *FastMRI: A Large Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.08839.

2. For the **MIDA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Iacono, M. I., Neufeld, E., Akinnagbe, E., Bower, K., Wolf, J., Vogiatzis Oikonomidis, I., Sharma, D., Lloyd, B., Wilm, B. J., Wyss, M., et al. (2015). *MIDA: A Dataset for Medical Imaging with Deep Learning*. PloS one, 10(12), e0124126.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
