To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Language Processing for Knowledge Discovery and Information Extraction from Energetics Corpora" by Francis G. VanGessel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on NLP methods applied to a curated dataset of energetics-related scientific articles, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically the **subsection 4.1 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the dataset curation process in detail. Here, they mention the creation of a primary dataset consisting of approximately 80,000 paragraphs and abstracts from various sources, including:

1. **Journal Articles**: About 5,000 abstracts from journals related to energetics, specifically from the Journal of Energetics and the journal Propellants, Explosives, and Pyrotechnics.
2. **Web Scraped Data**: Approximately 40,000 paragraphs extracted from roughly 1,000 journal articles using a custom web scraping tool.
3. **International Detonation Symposium**: Abstracts and paragraphs from the full text of this symposium.
4. **Wikipedia Articles**: Relevant articles scraped to include fundamental knowledge about energetics and explosives.

The authors also mention a **hand-labeled test dataset** composed of 258 energetic materials scientific abstracts, categorized into four classes: Characterization, Modeling, Processing, and Synthesis.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are primarily derived from journal articles and not standalone datasets, I will focus on citing the journals and symposiums from which the data was sourced.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Journal of Energetics** and **Propellants, Explosives, and Pyrotechnics**:
  > Various authors. *Journal of Energetics*. [Journal URL or DOI if available].
  > Various authors. *Propellants, Explosives, and Pyrotechnics*. [Journal URL or DOI if available].

- For the **International Detonation Symposium**:
  > Various authors. *Proceedings of the International Detonation Symposium*. [Symposium URL or DOI if available].

- For the **Wikipedia articles**:
  > Wikipedia contributors. "Energetics." *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [Wikipedia URL].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
