To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReasonChainQA: Text-based Complex Question Answering with Explainable Evidence Chains" by Minjun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the ReasonChainQA benchmark, which suggests that it is a dataset itself. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and characteristics, indicating that it is a complex question answering dataset with explicit reasoning chains.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and dataset collection sections**. The paper describes the ReasonChainQA dataset in detail, including its structure and the types of questions it addresses. It also references the KQA-Pro dataset as a source for generating complex questions and answers.

In the **dataset collection section**, the authors mention transforming knowledge base triples from **Wikidata** into natural language sentences, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's foundation. They also discuss the KQA-Pro dataset, which is used to obtain complex natural language questions and answers.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ReasonChainQA Dataset**: The paper itself serves as the primary source for this dataset. The citation is:
   > Zhu, M., Weng, Y., He, S., Liu, K., & Zhao, J. (2023). ReasonChainQA: Text-based Complex Question Answering with Explainable Evidence Chains. *Proceedings of the [Conference Name]*.

2. **KQA-Pro Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shi, J., Cao, S., Pan, L., Xiang, Y., Hou, L., Li, J., Zhang, H., & He, B. (2022). KQA Pro: A dataset with explicit compositional programs for complex question answering over knowledge base. *Proceedings of the [Conference Name]*.

3. **Wikidata**: The citation for Wikidata is:
   > Vrandecic, D., & Kr√∂tzsch, M. (2014). Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base. *Communications of The ACM*.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
