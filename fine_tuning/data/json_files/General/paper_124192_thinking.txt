To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching Neural Network Training Dataset to Improve Worst-Case Performance Guarantees" by Rahul Nellikkath and Spyros Chatzivasileiadis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of neural networks (NNs) in approximating non-linear relationships, particularly in the context of AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF). It hints at the use of datasets but does not specify any names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction emphasizes the importance of training data for NNs but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to **section IV (Results & Discussion)**, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention testing their algorithm on four test power systems: the 39-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 162-bus systems from the PGLib-OPF network library. This indicates that these systems serve as datasets for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the PGLib-OPF network library is:

- For the PGLib-OPF network library:
  > S. Babaeinejadsarookolaee et al., "The power grid library for benchmarking ac optimal power flow algorithms," arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.02788, 2019.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **PGLib-OPF Network Library**: This library includes various test power systems, specifically the 39-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 162-bus systems, which are used to evaluate the proposed NN dataset enrichment algorithm.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
