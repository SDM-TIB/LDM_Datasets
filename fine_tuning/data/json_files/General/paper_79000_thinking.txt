To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On architectural choices in deep learning: From network structure to gradient convergence and parameter estimation" by Vamsi K. Ithapu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract often provides a summary of the key contributions and may highlight the datasets used in the research.

2. **Identify Sections Related to Datasets**: Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss datasets. This could include sections titled "Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology." These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their characteristics (such as size, type, and any specific features), and how they were used in the experiments. I will also note any specific citations provided for these datasets.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

5. **Document the Findings**: I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The name of the dataset
   - A brief description of the dataset (size, type, features)
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that all relevant datasets have been documented accurately and completely.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I capture all necessary details about the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations.
