To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAR Image Despeckling Based on Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder" by Zhang Qianqian and Sun Ruizhi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setting sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for a large training dataset for deep learning applications in SAR image despeckling, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the challenges of obtaining high-quality SAR images and the limited availability of datasets for training deep learning models. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

In the **experimental setting section**, the authors state that they used SAR images from the **Sentinel-1 sensor** provided by the European Space Agency (ESA). This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset, as it is a publicly available dataset from ESA. Therefore, I will provide a general citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset based on its source.

The citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset is:
> European Space Agency. *Sentinel-1: A New Era for Radar Imaging*. Available: https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Sentinel-1 dataset as required.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
