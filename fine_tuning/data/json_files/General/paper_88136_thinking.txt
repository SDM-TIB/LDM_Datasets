To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Capsule-Based Persian/Arabic Robust Handwritten Digit Recognition Using EM Routing" by Ali Ghofrani and Rahil Mahdian Toroghi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Hoda dataset** for training their capsule network, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **experimental study section** (Section III) where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the **Hoda dataset** contains 60,000 training samples and 20,000 test samples of handwritten Persian/Arabic digits, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the paper. The introduction mentions **MNIST** as a widely used benchmark for handwritten digit recognition, but it is primarily for English digits. The authors emphasize the need for datasets tailored to Persian/Arabic digits, which leads me back to the **Hoda dataset** as the primary dataset used in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Hoda dataset**. The authors reference a paper by Khosravi and Kabir (2007) that introduces the dataset. The citation is as follows:

- **Hoda dataset**:
  > H. Khosravi and E. Kabir, “Introducing a very large dataset of handwritten farsi digits and a study on their varieties,” *Pattern Recognition Letters*, vol. 28, no. 10, pp. 1133–1141, 2007.

Since the authors also mention **MNIST**, I will include its citation as well, even though it is not the primary dataset used in their experiments:

- **MNIST dataset**:
  > Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio, and P. Haffner, “Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition,” *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
