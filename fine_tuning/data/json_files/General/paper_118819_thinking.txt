To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher degree sum-of-squares relaxations robust against oblivious outliers" by Tommaso dâ€™Orsi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. If such a section exists, I will extract the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets.

If the datasets are not clearly outlined in a specific section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. Authors often discuss the datasets in the context of their findings, which can provide additional context and details.

Once I identify the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will note the details such as the number of videos, types of annotations, and any specific splits used for training and testing. I will then find the full citation for this dataset in the references.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as part of the documentation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Check results and discussion sections for additional dataset references.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section.
5. Document the datasets with their descriptions and citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
