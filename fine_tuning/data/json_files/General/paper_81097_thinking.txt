To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tournament Based Ranking CNN for the Cataract grading" by Dohyeun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract discusses the challenges of classifying cataract grades due to imbalanced datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper. The introduction provides context about cataract grading and mentions the use of images from slit-lamp microscopes, indicating that a dataset related to these images may be involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors describe their approach to cataract grading and mention that the cataract grade dataset is provided by Korea University hospital. This is a crucial piece of information indicating the source of the dataset.

I will then check the **experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the number of images per cataract grade. They list the number of images for each grade, which is essential for understanding the dataset's composition. The table in this section shows the distribution of images across different cataract grades, which is important for evaluating the dataset's balance.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Cataract Grade Dataset**: This dataset is provided by Korea University hospital and consists of images categorized into six grades of cataract. The number of images per grade is as follows:
   - Grade 1: 8 images
   - Grade 2: 96 images
   - Grade 3: 105 images
   - Grade 4: 63 images
   - Grade 5: 14 images
   - Grade 6: 8 images

Finally, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is provided by Korea University hospital, I will note that it may not have a formal citation like published datasets, but I will acknowledge it as the source.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Cataract Grade Dataset, provided by Korea University Hospital.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information and prepare to format it according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as specified.
