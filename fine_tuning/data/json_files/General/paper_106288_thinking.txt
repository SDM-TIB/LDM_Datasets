To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Morphological feature visualization of Alzheimer’s disease via Multidirectional Perception GAN" by Wen Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was evaluated on the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the dataset used for evaluation, stating that it includes T1-weighted MR images from the ADNI public dataset. They mention that a total of **5316 MR images** were utilized, which includes various subject categories such as Normal Control (NC), Significant Memory Concern (SMC), early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).

I will also check the **demographic characteristics table** (Table I) for additional details about the dataset, such as the number of subjects in each category and their characteristics. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's composition.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The ADNI dataset is a well-known public dataset, and its citation is typically available in the references. The citation for the ADNI dataset is:

> Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. "ADNI: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative." [Online]. Available: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/about/

Since the ADNI dataset is a public dataset, I will ensure to include this citation in the dataset entry.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ADNI dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research paper.
