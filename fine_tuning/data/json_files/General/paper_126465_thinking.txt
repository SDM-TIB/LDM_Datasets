To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PVT-SSD: Single-Stage 3D Object Detector with Point-Voxel Transformer" by Honghui Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several autonomous driving benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Waymo Open Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale autonomous driving dataset consisting of 798 scenes for training and 202 scenes for validation. The evaluation metrics include average precision (AP) and average precision weighted by heading (APH).

2. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 7481 training samples and 7518 testing samples in autonomous driving scenes, with a common practice of dividing the training data into a train set and a validation set.

3. **nuScenes Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a challenging dataset for autonomous driving, containing 380K LiDAR sweeps from 1000 scenes. The evaluation metrics include mean average precision (mAP) and a novel nuScenes detection score (NDS).

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Waymo Open Dataset**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

- For the **nuScenes Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
