To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ImmFusion: Robust mmWave-RGB Fusion for 3D Human Body Reconstruction in All Weather Conditions" by Anjun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, mmBody," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction**. The authors refer to the "large-scale mmWave human body dataset" and mention that it consists of synchronized and calibrated mmWave radar point clouds and RGBD images in various conditions. This suggests that the dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide more context about the mmBody dataset, stating that it includes data captured in various environments and has mesh annotations for humans. They specify that they used 10 sequences for training and 2 sequences for testing across different scenes, including adverse conditions like rain and smoke.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the mmBody dataset. The relevant citation is:

- Chen, A., Wang, X., Zhu, S., Li, Y., Chen, J., & Ye, Q. (2022). *mmBody benchmark: 3D body reconstruction dataset and analysis for millimeter wave radar*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.05070.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset, including the authors, title, and where it can be found.

Finally, I will summarize the findings about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: mmBody
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset consisting of synchronized and calibrated mmWave radar point clouds and RGBD images in various environments, with mesh annotations for human bodies.
   - **Citation**: Chen, A., Wang, X., Zhu, S., Li, Y., Chen, J., & Ye, Q. (2022). *mmBody benchmark: 3D body reconstruction dataset and analysis for millimeter wave radar*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.05070.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further use.
