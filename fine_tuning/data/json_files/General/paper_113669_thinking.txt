To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large-scale Knowledge Distillation with Elastic Heterogeneous Computing Resources" by Ji Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental validation and mention using real datasets, specifically the **ImageNet dataset**. This is a crucial piece of information, as it indicates that this dataset is central to their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. For the ImageNet dataset, the citation is:

> Deng J, Dong W, Socher R, Li L, Li K, Li F. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In: IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR). ; 2009: 248-255.

Since the paper primarily mentions the ImageNet dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its significance in the context of the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and present the dataset information from the paper.
