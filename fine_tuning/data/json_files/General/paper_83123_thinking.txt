To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Neural Network Verification via Shadow Prices" by VicenÃ§ Rubies-Royo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)** benchmark for verification tasks, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they tested their approach on a set of ten properties related to the ACAS benchmark. They provide details about the properties, including input constraints and desired output properties, which further confirms that the ACAS benchmark is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide a detailed description of the ACAS benchmark properties, which includes input constraints and the expected outputs for various scenarios. This section is crucial as it provides context and specifics about how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) Benchmark**: This dataset is used for verifying properties of feedforward ReLU networks. It consists of various properties that define the behavior of the neural networks in safety-critical scenarios involving aircraft.

Next, I will check the **References section** for the full citation of the ACAS benchmark. However, the paper does not provide a separate citation for the ACAS benchmark itself, as it is a well-known dataset in the field of neural network verification.

Since the ACAS benchmark is widely recognized, I will use the following citation for it:

- **ACAS Benchmark**:

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry for the ACAS benchmark, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
