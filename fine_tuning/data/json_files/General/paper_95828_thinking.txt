To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IIT kgp at FinCausal 2020, Shared Task 1: Causality Detection using Sentence Embeddings in Financial Reports" by Arka Mitra et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, data, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of financial data and the need for causality detection, but they do not mention specific datasets here. I will move on to the **data section**.

In the **data section**, the authors state that the data was provided as part of the Financial Narrative Workshop by the organizers (Mariko et al., 2020). They mention that the training data consisted of about 4200 sentences, divided into causal and non-causal classes. However, they refer to the datasets as "Trial1, Practice1, and Evaluation1" without providing detailed descriptions or citations.

Next, I will check the **results section**, where the authors mention that they ran initial experiments on the "Trial1 dataset." This confirms that "Trial1" is one of the datasets used, but again, there are no detailed descriptions or citations provided.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the citation for the source of the datasets. The relevant reference is:

- Mariko, D., Abi Akl, H., Labidurie, E., Durfort, S., de Mazancourt, H., & El-Haj, M. (2020). The financial document causality detection shared task (finCausal 2020). In The 1st Joint Workshop on Financial Narrative Processing and MultiLing Financial Summarisation (FNP-FNS 2020, Barcelona, Spain).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **Trial1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 4200 sentences, classified into causal and non-causal sentences. It is used for training models in the causality detection task.

2. **Practice1 Dataset**: Although not described in detail, this dataset is likely used for practice or preliminary testing in the shared task.

3. **Evaluation1 Dataset**: Similar to Practice1, this dataset is used for evaluation purposes in the shared task.

Since the paper does not provide specific details for Practice1 and Evaluation1, I will note that they are part of the FinCausal 2020 shared task datasets.

Finally, I will ensure to include the full citation for the source of these datasets in my output.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
