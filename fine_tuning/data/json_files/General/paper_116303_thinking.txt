To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Algorithms that Approximate Data Removal: New Results and Limitations" by Vinith M. Suriyakumar and Ashia C. Wilson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors empirically evaluate their algorithm across a variety of benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for digit classification and contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits. The authors specifically focus on predicting between the digits 3 and 8.

2. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of street signs containing digits from 1 to 9. Similar to the MNIST dataset, the authors simplify the task to binary classification between the digits 3 and 8.

3. **Warfarin Dosing Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict appropriate dosages of Warfarin based on demographic and physiological factors. It contains 5,528 examples, each with 62 features.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **SVHN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. 2011.

- For the **Warfarin Dosing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium. Estimation of the warfarin dose with clinical and pharmacogenetic data. New England Journal of Medicine, 360(8):753â€“764, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation.
