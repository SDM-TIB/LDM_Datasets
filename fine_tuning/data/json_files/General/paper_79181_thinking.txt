To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Random Weights for Texture Generation in One Layer CNNs" by Mihir Mongia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of one-layer CNNs with random filters for texture generation, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in previous works. The authors cite several studies, but I need to determine if they mention any datasets directly. The introduction references works by Gatys et al., Champandard, He et al., and Ustyuzhaninov et al., but again, no specific datasets are named.

Moving on to the **experiments and results sections**, I will look for any mention of datasets used for testing or validation. If the authors conducted experiments, they might have used standard datasets for texture generation or comparison.

In the **references section**, I will check if any of the cited works include datasets that could be relevant. For instance, the works by Gatys et al. and Ustyuzhaninov et al. might have associated datasets that are commonly used in texture synthesis research.

After reviewing the paper thoroughly, I will compile any identified datasets along with their full citations. If no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will note that as well.

Finally, I will ensure that I format the dataset information clearly, including the title, description, and full citation for each dataset, if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, adhering to the importance of proper citation.
