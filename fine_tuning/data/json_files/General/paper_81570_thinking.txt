To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SHOMA at Parseme Shared Task on Automatic Identification of VMWEs: Neural Multiword Expression Tagging with High Generalisation" by Shiva Taslimipoor and Omid Rohanian, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the Parseme shared task, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Parseme shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) and mention that the task covers data for **20 languages**. This implies that there is a dataset associated with this task, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for the shared task. They mention that native speakers annotated data for various categories of VMWEs, including Light verb constructions (LVCs), verbal idioms (VID), inherently reflexive verbs (IRV), verb-particle constructions (VPC), multi-verb constructions (MVC), and inherently adpositional verbs (IAV). This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

The authors also refer to the **PARSEME annotation**, which includes the VMWE’s consecutive number in the sentence and its category. This annotation scheme is crucial for understanding how the dataset is organized.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but it references the shared task and its guidelines. Therefore, I will cite the shared task paper as the authoritative source for the dataset:

- For the **Parseme shared task**, the citation is:
  > Carlos Ramisch, Silvio Ricardo Cordeiro, Agata Savary, Veronika Vincze, Verginica Barbu Mititelu, Archna Bhatia, Maja Buljan, Marie Candito, Polona Gantar, Voula Giouli, Tunga Güngör, Abdelati Hawwari, Uxoa Iñurrieta, Jolanta Kovalevskaitė, Simon Krek, Timm Lichte, Chaya Liebeskind, Johanna Monti, Carla Parra Escartín, Behrang QasemiZadeh, Renata Ramisch, Nathan Schneider, Ivelina Stoyanova, Ashwini Vaidya, and Abigail Walsh. *Edition 1.1 of the Parseme shared task on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Linguistic Annotation, Multiword Expressions and Constructions (LAW-MWE-CxG-2018), pages 222–240. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset's purpose, structure, and citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or analysis.
