To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Low-Latency Energy-Efficient Deep SNNs via Attention-Guided Compression" by Souvik Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including the data augmentation techniques used and the specific configurations for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were applied in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or use of the datasets in related research.
