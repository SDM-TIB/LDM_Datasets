To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "BiLD: Bi-directional Logits Difference Loss for Large Language Model Distillation" by Xiaohui Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **13 datasets** using two types of LLMs. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that they evaluated their BiLD loss on **8 datasets from the SuperGLUE benchmark** and **5 extra datasets** used in previous works about model compression. I will need to extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in section 4.1 are:

1. **SuperGLUE benchmark datasets**:
   - **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no questions.
   - **CB**: A dataset for natural language inference.
   - **COPA**: A dataset for commonsense causal reasoning.
   - **MultiRC**: A dataset for reading comprehension.
   - **ReCoRD**: A dataset for reading comprehension with commonsense reasoning.
   - **RTE**: A dataset for recognizing textual entailment.
   - **WiC**: A dataset for word-in-context evaluation.
   - **WSC**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.

2. **Extra datasets**:
   - **Arc-C**: A dataset for reasoning challenges.
   - **Arc-E**: Another dataset for reasoning challenges.
   - **HellaSwag**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.
   - **PIQA**: A dataset for physical commonsense reasoning.
   - **WinoGrande**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
