To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoupled Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss" by Jiequan Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their proposed method on **CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe their experimental settings and explicitly state that they conduct experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** for adversarial training and knowledge distillation tasks. They provide details about the datasets, such as the number of images and classes, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **CIFAR-10 dataset** as consisting of 60,000 32Ã—32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The **CIFAR-100 dataset** is described as having 100 classes, each containing 600 images, with 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. This detailed information is essential for accurately documenting the datasets.

Additionally, the authors mention the **ImageNet dataset** in section 4.2, stating that it consists of 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 images for validation across 1,000 classes. This information is also critical for the dataset extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, and Michael Bernstein. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. IJCV, 2015.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
