To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DistillCSE: Distilled Contrastive Learning for Sentence Embeddings" by Jiahao Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a dataset of **one million randomly sampled sentences from English Wikipedia** for unsupervised training. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. Since the dataset is derived from Wikipedia, I will cite it as follows:

- For the Wikipedia dataset, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org

Additionally, the authors evaluate their model on **seven sentence semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks**, which include STS tasks from 2012 to 2016, STS Benchmark, and SICK-Relatedness. I will also look for citations for these tasks.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations for the STS tasks:

- For STS tasks 2012-2016, the citation is:
  > Eneko Agirre, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, and Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre. *SemEval-2012 task 6: A pilot on semantic textual similarity*. In *SEM 2012: The First Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics – Volume 1: Proceedings of the main conference and the shared task, and Volume 2: Proceedings of the Sixth International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2012)*, pages 385–393, Montréal, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2012.

- For the STS Benchmark, the citation is:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In *Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017)*, pages 1–14, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2017.

- For SICK-Relatedness, the citation is:
  > Marco Marelli, Stefano Menini, Marco Baroni, Luisa Bentivogli, Raffaella Bernardi, and Roberto Zamparelli. *A SICK cure for the evaluation of compositional distributional semantic models*. In *Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’14)*, pages 216–223, Reykjavik, Iceland. European Language Resources Association (ELRA), 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
