To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Best of Both Worlds: Hybrid SNN-ANN Architecture for Event-based Optical Flow Estimation" by Shubham Negi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the hybrid architecture on **DSEC-flow** and **MVSEC** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **DSEC-flow dataset**, which consists of optical flow ground truths for 24 driving sequences, totaling 7800 training samples and 2100 test samples. They also mention that the ground truths for the test sequences are not public, and they created their own test sequence by splitting the training set.

In the same section, the **MVSEC dataset** is described as comprising four indoor flying sequences, two outdoor day driving sequences, and three outdoor night driving sequences. The authors state that the networks are trained in a self-supervised manner on the outdoor day driving sequence and evaluated on the indoor flying sequences and the outdoor day driving sequence.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **DSEC-flow dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mathias Gehrig et al. "DSEC: A stereo event camera dataset for driving scenarios." IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 6(3):4947–4954, 2021.

2. For the **MVSEC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Zihao Zhu et al. "The multivehicle stereo event camera dataset: An event camera dataset for 3D perception." IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 3(3):2032–2039, 2018.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
