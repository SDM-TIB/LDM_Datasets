To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SVADHYAYA SYSTEM FOR THE SECOND DIAGNOSING COVID-19 USING ACOUSTICS CHALLENGE 2021" by Deepak Mittal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the system detects COVID-19 using three different acoustic modalities: speech, breathing, and cough. This suggests that there may be datasets associated with these modalities.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Results)**, where the authors mention that they developed their models based on "The Second DiCOVA Challenge development data set." This is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, stating that it comprises three sound modalities (breathing, cough, and speech) with a total of 965 sound samples, of which 17.2% belong to the COVID-19 positive class. They also mention the total durations for each modality, which adds context to the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the study. The relevant reference is:

- For **The Second DiCOVA Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Neeraj Kumar Sharma, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Debarpan Bhattacharya, Debottam Dutta, Pravin Mote, and Sriram Ganapathy. *The second dicova challenge: Dataset, task, and baseline system for covid-19 diagnosis using acoustics*. In IEEE Intl. Conference on Acoustics Speech Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
