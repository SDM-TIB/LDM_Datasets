To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Zero-Inﬂated Quality Estimation Model For Automatic Speech Recognition System" by Kai Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and mentions the use of a large Mandarin speech recognition corpus, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.2, the authors mention a "large Mandarin speech recognition corpus containing 20,000 hours of training data with about 20 million sentences." This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper. In section 4.1, the authors refer to using data from the "3rd CHIME challenge," which indicates another dataset relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **large Mandarin speech recognition corpus**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is implied that this dataset is part of the authors' in-house resources. Therefore, I will note it as an internal dataset without a formal citation.

2. For the **3rd CHIME challenge dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. "The third chime speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines." In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU), pp. 504–511, 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- **Large Mandarin speech recognition corpus**: Internal dataset, no formal citation available.
- **3rd CHIME challenge dataset**: Citation provided above.

This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
