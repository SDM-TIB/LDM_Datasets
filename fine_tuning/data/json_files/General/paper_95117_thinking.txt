To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and Community Challenges" by Lowik Chanussot et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the OC20 dataset, which consists of over 1.2 million Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations. This indicates that the dataset is significant and likely contains detailed information about its structure and usage.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **methodology**. In this paper, the dataset is described in detail in the **"The OC20 Dataset"** section. Here, the authors provide specifics about the dataset, including its size, the types of calculations performed, and the tasks it is designed to support.

The OC20 dataset is primarily focused on DFT relaxations of molecular adsorptions onto surfaces, and it includes:
1. **640,081 relaxations** across various surfaces and adsorbates.
2. Additional data from **molecular dynamics (MD)** simulations and **rattled structures** to enhance the dataset's diversity.

In the **"Dataset Generation"** section, the authors describe the process of creating the dataset, which includes adsorbate selection, surface selection, initial structure generation, and structure relaxation. This section provides insights into the dataset's composition and the methodologies used to generate it.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The OC20 dataset is referenced as follows:
- Chanussot, L., Das, A., Goyal, S., Lavril, T., Shuaibi, M., Riviere, M., Tran, K., Heras-Domingo, J., Ho, C., Hu, W., Palizhati, A., Sriram, A., Wood, B., Yoon, J., Parikh, D., Zitnick, C. L., & Ulissi, Z. (2020). *The Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset and Community Challenges*. Available at: http://opencatalystproject.org.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the OC20 dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key aspects of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and the types of data it contains, along with the citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured and formatted according to the requirements.
