To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "LlamBERT: Large-scale low-cost data annotation in NLP" by Bálint Csanády et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets: the **IMDb review dataset** and the **UMLS Meta-Thesaurus**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The IMDb dataset)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive description of the IMDb dataset. They mention that it is a binary sentiment dataset consisting of 25,000 labeled movie reviews for training, 25,000 for testing, and an additional 50,000 unlabeled reviews. This section confirms the dataset's significance in NLP for classification tasks.

I will then look for the full citation of the IMDb dataset in the **References section**. The citation provided is:
> Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150. Association for Computational Linguistics, Portland, Oregon, USA. URL: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (The UMLS dataset)**, where the authors describe the UMLS Meta-Thesaurus. They explain that it is a comprehensive collection of nearly 200 biomedical vocabularies, which includes over 3 million concepts. The authors specifically focus on a subset related to anatomical entities within the human nervous system, which they annotated for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for the full citation of the UMLS dataset. The citation is:
> Bodenreider, O. (2004). The unified medical language system (UMLS): integrating biomedical terminology. Nucleic acids research, 32(suppl_1):D267–D270.

Now that I have identified both datasets and their respective citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **IMDb Review Dataset**: A binary sentiment dataset with 25,000 labeled reviews for training and testing, plus 50,000 unlabeled reviews.
   - Citation: Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., and Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150. Association for Computational Linguistics, Portland, Oregon, USA. URL: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1015.

2. **UMLS Meta-Thesaurus**: A comprehensive collection of biomedical vocabularies, focusing on anatomical entities related to the human nervous system.
   - Citation: Bodenreider, O. (2004). The unified medical language system (UMLS): integrating biomedical terminology. Nucleic acids research, 32(suppl_1):D267–D270.

With this information, I am now ready to compile the dataset entries into the required format for further processing or review.
