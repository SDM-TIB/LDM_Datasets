To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Binary Stochastic Filtering: a Method for Neural Network Size Minimization and Supervised Feature Selection" by A. Trelina and A. Procházka, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method was tested on various datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. They specifically mention three datasets:

1. **Wine Dataset**: This dataset consists of 178 instances and 13 features, used for chemical analysis of wine from three different cultivars.

2. **KDD99 Dataset**: This dataset contains 918,455 instances and 41 features, representing a wide variety of intrusion data simulated in a military network environment.

3. **Musk2 Dataset**: This dataset has 6,598 instances and 168 features, used for the classification of molecules judged to be musk or non-musk.

In the **table summarizing the classification datasets**, I will confirm the details about the instances, classes, and features for each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Wine Dataset**:
  > Forina, M., Aeberhard, S., & Leardi, R. (2012). *Wine dataset*. PARVUS, Via Brigata Salerno. Retrieved from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine.

- For the **KDD99 Dataset**:
  > Chaudhuri, S., Madigan, D., & Fayyad, U. (2000). *KDD-99: The fifth ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining*. SIGKDD Explor. Newsl., 1, 49–51.

- For the **Musk2 Dataset**:
  > Dietterich, T. G., Lathrop, R. H., & Lozano-Pérez, T. (1997). *Solving the multiple instance problem with axis-parallel rectangles*. Artificial Intelligence, 89(1-2), 31–71.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
