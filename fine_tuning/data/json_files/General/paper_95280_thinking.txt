To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Checkerboard-Artifact-Free Image-Enhancement Network Considering Local and Global Features" by Yuma Kinoshita and Hitoshi Kiya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed network and its performance but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction mentions various image enhancement methods and references prior works, but it does not specify any datasets used for experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the **simulation section**, the authors state that they evaluated their method using a dataset from a previous work by Cai et al. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find the exact name and details.

In the **references section**, I will locate the citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant reference is:
- **Cai et al. (2018)**: 
  > J. Cai, S. Gu, and L. Zhang. "Learning a Deep Single Image Contrast Enhancer from Multi-Exposure Images." IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 27, no. 4, pp. 2049â€“2062, Apr. 2018.

This reference indicates that the dataset used for training the proposed network is derived from the work of Cai et al., which involves multi-exposure images.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:
1. **Multi-Exposure Image Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training the proposed image enhancement network. It is based on the work of Cai et al. and is designed for learning deep single image contrast enhancement.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset information along with its proper citation.
