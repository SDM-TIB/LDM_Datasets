To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MobileLLM: Optimizing Sub-billion Parameter Language Models for On-Device Use Cases" by Zechun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and while it may not list specific datasets, it can indicate the types of tasks and benchmarks the authors are focusing on.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks and datasets in the context of their experiments, including:

1. **Zero-shot Common Sense Reasoning Tasks**: The authors refer to multiple datasets such as BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC, and OBQA. I will need to extract details about each of these datasets, including their purpose and characteristics.

2. **Question Answering Tasks**: The paper mentions the TriviaQA dataset, which is used for closed-book question answering. I will gather information about this dataset as well.

3. **Reading Comprehension Tasks**: The RACE dataset is referenced, and I will look for its details as well.

4. **Chat Benchmarks**: The authors evaluate their models on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, which are used for chat-based tasks. I will extract relevant information about these benchmarks.

5. **API Calling Dataset**: The authors created a synthetic dataset for API calling tasks, which I will also describe.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Here are the datasets I will extract and their citations:

12. **API Calling Dataset**: This dataset is synthetic and created by the authors, so it may not have a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is accurately described with its citation.
