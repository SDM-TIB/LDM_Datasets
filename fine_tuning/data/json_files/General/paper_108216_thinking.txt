To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Particle Transformer for Jet Tagging" by Huilin Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **JETCLASS** dataset, which is a significant focus of the paper, indicating that it is a new comprehensive dataset for jet tagging.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (The JETCLASS Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the JETCLASS dataset, including its size (100 million jets) and the types of jets it includes (10 types). This section will also provide insights into how the dataset was generated and its intended use in deep learning for jet tagging.

In addition to JETCLASS, I will check for any references to other datasets in the **related work** section (section 3). The authors mention several existing datasets used for jet tagging, including:

1. **Top quark tagging dataset**: Proposed in Butter et al. (2019), consisting of 2 million jets in 2 types (bqq′ and q/g).
2. **Quark-gluon tagging dataset**: Proposed in Komiske et al. (2019), consisting of 2 million jets in 2 types (quark and gluon).
3. **Higgs boson tagging dataset**: Containing 3.9 million b¯b jets and 1.9 million q/g jets, referenced in Duarte (2019) and Chen et al. (2022).
4. **JetNet dataset**: Proposed in Kansal et al. (2021), containing 500,000 jets in 3 types (gluon, light quark, and top quark).
5. **Multiclass dataset**: Proposed in Moreno et al. (2020), with 880,000 jets in 5 classes (light quark, gluon, W boson, Z boson, and top quark).

I will compile the details of each dataset, including their characteristics and the citations provided in the references section.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
