To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Two-stage Design Scheme of Equalizers for Uplink FBMC/OQAM-based Massive MIMO Systems" by Yuhao Qi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. If the paper does not have a specific section for datasets, I will look for mentions of datasets in the methodology or results sections.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "3GPP-EVA" channel model, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is part of a larger study or paper, I will ensure to cite the original source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
