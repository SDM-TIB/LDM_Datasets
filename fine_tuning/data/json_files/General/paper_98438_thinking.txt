To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpecTr: Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Pathology Image Segmentation" by Boxiang Yun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of hyperspectral imaging for pathology image segmentation, which suggests that specific datasets may be involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the transition from traditional methods to deep learning for hyperspectral pathology image segmentation. However, they do not mention specific datasets here, so I will continue to the methodology section.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention the **multi-dimensional choledoch dataset** used for cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of scenes (514), the quality of labels, and the specifics of the hyperspectral imaging system used to capture the images. This section confirms that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the multi-dimensional choledoch dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Zhang, Q., Li, Q., Yu, G., Sun, L., Zhou, M., Chu, J. *A multidimensional choledoch database and benchmarks for cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis*. IEEE Access 7, 149414â€“149421, 2019.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Multi-dimensional choledoch dataset**: This dataset consists of 514 scenes with high-quality labels for training and testing, specifically for cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis. The dataset captures images using a microscopy hyperspectral imaging system, covering wavelengths from 550 nm to 1000 nm, resulting in 60 spectral bands for each scene.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research.
