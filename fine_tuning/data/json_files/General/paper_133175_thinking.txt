To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Step-Back Prompting Enables Reasoning Via Abstraction in Large Language Models" by Huaixiu Steven Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the tasks and datasets used in their experiments. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In **subsection 3.1 (Tasks)**, the authors list several datasets:
1. **MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020)**: This dataset is used for evaluating language understanding across various domains, specifically in high school physics and chemistry.
2. **GSM8K**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning tasks.
3. **TimeQA (Chen et al., 2021)**: A dataset for answering time-sensitive questions.
4. **SituatedQA (Zhang & Choi, 2021)**: A dataset that requires answering questions with temporal or geographical context.
5. **MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022)**: A multi-hop reasoning dataset.
6. **StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021)**: A dataset for open-domain questions requiring strategic reasoning.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **MMLU**:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding*. arXiv:2009.03300, 2020.
  
- For **GSM8K**:
  > The GSM8K dataset is referenced in the paper by Khot et al. (2022). The citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
