To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Shape and Gait Representations Learning for Video-based Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification" by Vuong D. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two large-scale VCCRe-ID datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they validated their framework on two public VCCRe-ID datasets: **VCCR** and **CCVID**. 

1. **VCCR Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 4,384 tracklets with 392 identities, where each identity has between 2 to 10 different suits. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method under clothing changes.

2. **CCVID Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,856 tracklets with 226 identities, each having 2 to 5 different suits. The authors note that this dataset mimics simpler Re-ID scenarios, which is important for understanding the robustness of their method.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **VCCR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han, K., Huang, Y., Gong, S., Huang, Y., Wang, L., and Tan, T. (2023). *3D shape temporal aggregation for video-based clothing-change person re-identification*. In ACCV, pages 71–88.

- For the **CCVID dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gu, X., Chang, H., Ma, B., Bai, S., Shan, S., and Chen, X. (2022). *Clothes-changing person re-identification with RGB modality only*. In CVPR, pages 1050–1059.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
