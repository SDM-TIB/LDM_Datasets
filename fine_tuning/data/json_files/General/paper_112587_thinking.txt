To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secure Wireless Transmission for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Full Duplex Systems" by Pengxin Guan, Yiru Wang, and Yuping Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses related work, which may include datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for any specific sections that might detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, there may not be a dedicated section explicitly labeled "Datasets," so I will need to be attentive to any mentions of datasets throughout the text, especially in the **experiments or results sections**.

If the authors refer to any datasets, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were used in the experiments. I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or publication details.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information into a structured output that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
