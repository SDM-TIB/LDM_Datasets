To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting and Advancing Fast Adversarial Training Through the Lens of Bi-Level Optimization" by Yihua Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the introduction discusses the effectiveness of adversarial training and mentions that the authors conducted experiments across multiple datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the provided text, the authors specifically mention evaluating their method on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Tiny-ImageNet**, and **ImageNet**. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned:
1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is part of the same dataset collection:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pp. 248–255, 2009.

4. **ImageNet**: The citation is the same as Tiny-ImageNet:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pp. 248–255, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
