To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multivariate Realized Volatility Forecasting with Graph Neural Network" by Qinkai Chen and Christian-Yann Robert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments based on about **500 stocks from the S&P 500 index**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their use of **NYSE daily TAQ data** as the limit order book data, which is essential for their model. This data includes all quotes and trades, and it is explicitly stated that they focus on stocks included in the S&P 500 index.

In the **data sampling section**, the authors detail their sampling strategy, indicating that they sampled data with a fixed frequency of one second. This further confirms the use of the NYSE daily TAQ data for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key datasets identified are:

1. **NYSE Daily TAQ Data**: This dataset is used for limit order book data and is crucial for the experiments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > NYSE. *NYSE Daily TAQ Data*. Available at: https://www.nyse.com/market-data/historical/daily-taq.

2. **S&P 500 Index**: The authors mention using about 500 stocks from the S&P 500 index. The citation for this index is:
   > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
