To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Car Damage Detection and Patch-to-Patch Self-supervised Image Alignment" by Hanxiao Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses car damage detection and image alignment but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the use of custom images for car damage detection but does not specify any publicly available datasets. This suggests that the research relies on a proprietary dataset created by the author.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically sections II and III) to see if there are any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The author describes the process of collecting custom car images and annotating them, indicating that the dataset is not publicly available but rather a custom dataset created for this research.

Since the paper does not reference any established datasets or provide citations for them, I will note that the dataset is a custom collection of car images. The author does not provide a formal name for this dataset, nor does it appear in the references section.

Finally, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not utilize any publicly available datasets; instead, it relies on a custom dataset of car images collected and annotated by the author.

Since there are no formal citations for datasets in this paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to list with citations. 

In summary, the extraction process reveals that the research is based on a custom dataset, and I will document this finding accordingly.
