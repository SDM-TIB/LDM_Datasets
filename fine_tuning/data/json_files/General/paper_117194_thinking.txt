To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shapley Head Pruning: Identifying and Removing Interference in Multilingual Transformers" by William Held and Diyi Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of multilingual models and refer to specific tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. However, I need to locate the exact names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **Cross-Lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI)**: This dataset is used for the task of classifying whether a hypothesis is entailed by, contradicted by, or neither related to a premise. The authors note that it is aligned, which helps control for confounding variations.

2. **Universal Dependencies Part-of-Speech (UDPOS)**: This dataset is used for structured prediction tasks, specifically for predicting part-of-speech tags. The authors mention that it is part of the Universal Dependencies v2 corpus.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2475–2485, Brussels, Belgium, 2018. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **UDPOS**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Nivre, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Filip Ginter, Jan Hajič, Christopher D. Manning, Sampo Pyysalo, Sebastian Schuster, Francis Tyers, and Daniel Zeman. *Universal Dependencies v2: An evergrowing multilingual treebank collection*. In Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 4034–4043, Marseille, France, 2020. European Language Resources Association.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
