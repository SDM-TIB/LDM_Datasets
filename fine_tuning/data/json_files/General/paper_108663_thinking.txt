To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Partitioned Variational Inference: A Framework for Probabilistic Federated Learning" by Matthew Ashman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention datasets used for empirical validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the experiments:

1. **UCI Classification Datasets**: The authors refer to three binary classification tasks from the UCI machine learning repository: 
   - **Adult Dataset**: Used to predict whether income exceeds $50,000/year based on census data.
   - **Bank Dataset**: Used to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit.
   - **Credit Dataset**: Used to predict whether individuals default on payments.

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is used for the mortality prediction task, consisting of clinical variables recorded during ICU stays.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors also mention using the MNIST dataset for multi-class classification tasks, which consists of handwritten digits.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the UCI datasets, the citation is:
- Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

For the MIMIC-III dataset, the citation is:
- Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W. M., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3, 160035.

For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
- LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278-2324.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
