To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Novel Nonlinear Neural-Network Layers for High Performance and Generalization in Modulation-Recognition Applications" by John A. Snoap and Dimitrie C. Popescu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the classification performance is tested using two distinct datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets Used for NN Training and Testing)**, where the authors explicitly mention the two datasets: **CSPB.ML.2018** and **CSPB.ML.2022**. The section provides a brief description of these datasets, noting that they contain signals corresponding to eight digital modulation schemes and that they were generated independently with distinct signal distribution parameters.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference a paper by Chad M. Spooner et al. that discusses the datasets. The citation is as follows:

- For **CSPB.ML.2018** and **CSPB.ML.2022**, the citation is:
  > C. Spooner, J. Snoap, J. Latshaw, and D. Popescu. *Synthetic Digitally Modulated Signal Datasets for Automatic Modulation Classification*. 2022. [Online]. Available: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/pcj5-zr38

Now, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **CSPB.ML.2018**: This dataset contains signals corresponding to various digital modulation schemes and is used for training and testing the proposed neural network model.

2. **CSPB.ML.2022**: Similar to CSPB.ML.2018, this dataset also contains signals for the same modulation schemes but generated independently, allowing for evaluation of the model's generalization ability.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
