To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Convergence of Online Identification for Mixed Linear Regression" by Yujing Liu, Zhixin Liu, and Lei Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, so I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including any tables or figures that summarize their properties.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets in the context of the findings. Authors often discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all datasets are clearly identified and properly cited.
