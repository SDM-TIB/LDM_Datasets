To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TextGAIL: Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Text Generation" by Qingyang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a diverse set of unconditional and conditional text generation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention:

1. **COCO Image Captions**: This dataset is used for unconditional text generation tasks. It contains 10,000 training samples with an average length of 11.36 words and a vocabulary size of 4,681.

2. **EMNLP2017 News**: Another dataset for unconditional generation tasks, consisting of 12,972 training samples with an average length of 27.03 words.

3. **CommonGEN**: This dataset is used for conditional generation tasks, where the model generates sentences based on three given words. It has 12,941 training samples with an average length of 10.97 words.

4. **ROCStories**: This dataset is also for conditional generation tasks, specifically for generating story endings. It contains 20,937 training samples with an average length of 10.59 words.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COCO Image Captions**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & DollÃ¡r, P. (2015). Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context. In *Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, 2014.

- For **EMNLP2017 News**, the citation is:
  > C. D. Manning, et al. (2017). *EMNLP 2017: Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **CommonGEN**, the citation is:
  > Lin, B. Y., Shen, M., Xing, Y., Zhou, P., & Ren, X. (2019). CommonGen: A Constrained Text Generation Dataset Towards Generative Commonsense Reasoning. *CoRR*, abs/1911.03705.

- For **ROCStories**, the citation is:
  > Mostafazadeh, N., Chambers, N., He, X., Parikh, D., Batra, D., Vanderwende, L., Kohli, P., & Allen, J. F. (2016). A Corpus and Evaluation Framework for Deeper Understanding of Commonsense Stories. *CoRR*, abs/1604.01696.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
