To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Switchable Online Knowledge Distillation" by Biao Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the motivation and background, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, classes, etc.).

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images. This dataset is also widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 64x64 color images across 200 classes, with 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images per class.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes, commonly used for training deep learning models in image classification tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Le, Y., Yang, X. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N (2015).

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211â€“252 (2015).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
