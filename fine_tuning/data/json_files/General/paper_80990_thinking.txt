To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Channel Correlation Networks for Action Classification" by Ali Diba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **HMDB51**: This dataset consists of 6,766 clips from 3,312 videos, covering 51 action classes. It is a well-known benchmark for action recognition tasks.

2. **UCF101**: This dataset contains 13,320 clips from 2,500 videos, representing 101 action classes. It is another widely used dataset in the field of action recognition.

3. **Kinetics**: The authors refer to the Kinetics dataset, which includes 400 action classes and has a substantial number of clips (306,245). They specify that they used the trimmed version of the dataset for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for the full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **HMDB51**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Jhuang, H., Stiefelhagen, R., & Serre, T. (2013). *HMDB51: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In High Performance Computing in Science and Engineering.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv:1212.0402.

- For **Kinetics**, the citation is:
  > Carreira, J., & Zisserman, A. (2017). *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In CVPR.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
