To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Broad Study of Pre-training for Domain Generalization and Adaptation" by Donghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of pre-training datasets for domain adaptation and generalization, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Analysis Setup)** and **section 4 (Experiments)**. In section 3, the authors mention several datasets used for pre-training and downstream tasks. I will take note of these datasets and their characteristics.

In **section 3**, the authors specifically mention the following pre-training datasets:
1. **ImageNet-1K**: A widely used dataset containing 1.2 million images across 1000 classes.
2. **ImageNet-22K**: A larger dataset that includes 14.1 million images across 22,000 classes.
3. **JFT-300M**: A dataset with 300 million images, primarily used for training large models.
4. **Conceptual Captions**: A dataset consisting of image-text pairs for training vision-language models.

In **section 4**, the authors discuss the downstream datasets used for evaluation:
1. **Office-Home (OH)**: Contains 15,000 images from 4 domains (Real, Painting, Clipart, Art) across 65 classes.
2. **DomainNet (DN)**: Comprises 586,000 images from 6 domains (Clipart, Infograph, Painting, Quickdraw, Real, Sketch) across 345 classes.
3. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011)**: Contains 15,000 images of 200 fine-grained bird species.
4. **iWildCAM2020 (WILD)**: A dataset with images from 182 different animal species captured by camera traps.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
