To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimal Sample Subspace Learning: Theory and Algorithms" by Yuqing Xia and Zhenyue Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their methods on specific datasets, which can provide additional context and confirmation of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Extended YaleB" dataset, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Georghiades, A. S., Belhumeur, P. N., & Kriegman, D. J. (2001). From few to many: Illumination cone models for face recognition under variable lighting and pose. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 23(6), 643-660.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, making sure to highlight the importance of each dataset in the context of the research presented in the paper.
