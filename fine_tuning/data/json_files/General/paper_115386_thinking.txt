To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Similarity Identifies Important Functional Connections for Phenotype Prediction" by Anton Orlichenko et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used the **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)** dataset for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In the paper, the authors describe the PNC dataset in detail in **section III.B (Brain development study)**. Here, they specify that the PNC dataset contains multi-paradigm fMRI data, neurocognitive assessments, and psychiatric evaluations for 1,445 healthy adolescents aged 8-23, and they used a subset of 620 subjects for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PNC dataset. The authors reference the original paper describing the PNC dataset, which is:

- **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)**:
  > Satterthwaite, T. D., et al. (2014). "Neuroimaging of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort." *NeuroImage*, 86, 544-553. DOI: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.09.025.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)**: This dataset includes multi-paradigm fMRI data, neurocognitive assessments, and psychiatric evaluations for 1,445 healthy adolescents aged 8-23. The authors specifically used a subset of 620 subjects who had both working memory and emotion identification fMRI scans, along with results from the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) to measure general intelligence.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
