To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Variational Inference for Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic Support" by Tim Reichelt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 6) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

Upon reviewing Section 6, I find that the authors conducted experiments using synthetic data and real-world datasets. They mention using a dataset of monthly counts of international airline passengers, which is a specific dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The dataset of monthly counts of international airline passengers is cited as follows:

- For the dataset of monthly counts of international airline passengers:
  > Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., Reinsel, G.C., & Ljung, G.M. (2015). *Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control*. Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics. Wiley. ISBN 9781118674925. URL: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rNt5CgAAQBAJ.

Next, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in a structured manner. I will ensure that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
