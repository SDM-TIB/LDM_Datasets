To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empowering Long-tail Item Recommendation through Cross Decoupling Network (CDN)" by Yin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimental results on public benchmark datasets and a production dataset at Google. This indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **MovieLens 1M**: This is a well-known dataset for movie recommendation tasks, containing 1 million ratings from users on various movies.
2. **BookCrossing**: Another public dataset used for book recommendation, which includes user ratings for books.
3. **Production dataset from Google**: This dataset is derived from user logs in Google app ads for predicting user engagement, specifically for app installs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **MovieLens 1M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):19, 2015. https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

- For **BookCrossing**, the citation is:
  > Paolo Massa and Paolo Avesani. *Trust-aware recommender systems*. In Proceedings of the 2007 ACM Conference on Recommender Systems, pages 17â€“24, 2007. http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/

- The production dataset from Google does not have a specific citation in the paper, but it is referenced as being derived from user logs in Google app ads.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details accurately for further processing or review.
