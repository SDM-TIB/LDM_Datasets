To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Vision Transformers for Incremental Learning" by Pei Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on both **CIFAR** and **ImageNet** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1000**: A large-scale dataset with 1000 classes, which is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.
2. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet-1000, consisting of 100 classes, used for evaluating incremental learning methods.
3. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset with small image resolution (32x32) containing 100 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.

In this section, the authors provide details about how they utilize these datasets in their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248â€“255.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
