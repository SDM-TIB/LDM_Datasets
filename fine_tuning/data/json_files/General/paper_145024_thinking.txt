To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Large Language Models for Knowledge-free Weak Supervision in Clinical Natural Language Processing" by Enshuo Hsu and Kirk Roberts, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their approach using **three different n2c2 datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methods section**. The authors mention using datasets from the **2012, 2014, and 2018 Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) Natural Language Processing Challenges**. I will need to gather more information about these datasets, including their specific focus and characteristics.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset:

1. **2012 i2b2 Challenge**: This dataset focuses on temporal relation extraction and includes **310 annotated clinical notes**. The entities include clinically significant events and temporal expressions.

2. **2014 i2b2 Challenge**: This dataset is centered on de-identification and consists of **1,304 annotated clinical notes**. It includes various types of protected health information (PHI).

3. **2018 i2b2 Challenge**: This dataset is used for extracting adverse drug events (ADEs) and medication properties from **505 discharge notes**. It defines multiple entity types related to medications.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the i2b2 challenges are as follows:

- For the **2012 i2b2 Challenge**:
  > Sun, W., Rumshisky, A., & Uzuner, O. (2013). Evaluating temporal relations in clinical text: 2012 i2b2 Challenge. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 20(6), 806-813.

- For the **2014 i2b2 Challenge**:
  > Stubbs, A., Kotfila, C., & Uzuner, O. (2015). Automated systems for the de-identification of longitudinal clinical narratives: Overview of 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task Track 1. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, 58, S11-S19.

- For the **2018 i2b2 Challenge**:
  > Henry, S., Buchan, K., Filannino, M., Stubbs, A., & Uzuner, O. (2019). 2018 n2c2 shared task on adverse drug events and medication extraction in electronic health records. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 27(3), 3-12.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
