To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reinforcement Learning for Optimizing RAG for Domain Chatbots" by Mandar Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions a "domain FAQ dataset consisting of 72 FAQs regarding the credit card application process," which indicates that there is a specific dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **section titled 'RAG for FAQ chatbots'** where the authors provide details about the dataset. Here, they describe the FAQ dataset in more detail, confirming that it consists of 72 FAQs related to the credit card application process. They also mention that the dataset was prepared based on a user survey to address common pain points regarding the application process.

I will also check the **'Training in-house embedding model'** section, where they discuss the creation of a dataset for training the embedding model. They mention generating multiple English and Hinglish paraphrase queries for the FAQs, which indicates that they have created a substantial amount of data for training purposes. They specify that they used approximately 3.5k queries for training, 1k for validation, and 1014 for testing.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the paper primarily discusses an in-house dataset created by the authors, there may not be external citations for the FAQ dataset itself. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created by the authors.

The relevant dataset information I will extract is as follows:

1. **Domain FAQ Dataset**: This dataset consists of 72 FAQs regarding the credit card application process, designed to answer user queries about general card information, pre-application issues, and post-application services.

2. **Embedding Training Dataset**: This dataset includes approximately 3.5k queries for training, 1k for validation, and 1014 for testing, generated using ChatGPT and manual tagging.

Since the FAQ dataset is original and created by the authors, I will note that in the citation. The citation for the paper itself will serve as the reference for the datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the necessary details and citations in the appropriate format.
