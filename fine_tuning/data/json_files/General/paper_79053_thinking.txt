To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Decomposition Framework for Discriminative Segmentation with Supermodular Losses" by Jiaqian Yu and Matthew B. Blaschko, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data used in experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any statements regarding the datasets used for training or evaluation. This section often contains background information that may reference existing datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly any subsections that discuss the experimental setup or datasets. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experimental results section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors may provide additional context or results related to the datasets, which can help confirm their relevance.

From my reading, I have identified two datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Microsoft Research Grabcut Database**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It is a well-known dataset for image segmentation tasks.

2. **Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR)**: This dataset consists of T1-weighted MR images and is used for brain structure segmentation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I found are:

- For the **Microsoft Research Grabcut Database**:
  > Rother, C., Kolmogorov, V., & Lempitsky, V. S. (2007). Optimizing binary MRFs via extended roof duality. In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2007.

- For the **Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR)**:
  > Rohlfing, T. (2012). Image similarity and tissue overlaps as surrogates for image registration accuracy: widely used but unreliable. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 31(2), 153-163.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
