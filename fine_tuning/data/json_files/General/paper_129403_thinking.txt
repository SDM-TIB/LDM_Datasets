To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization" by Yang Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **BookCorpus**: This dataset contains 800 million words and is used for training language models.
2. **English Wikipedia**: This dataset consists of 2.5 billion words and is also utilized for training.

Additionally, the authors refer to specific benchmarks in **section 4.1**: 
- **GLUE benchmark**: A collection of nine natural language understanding tasks.
- **SQuAD v1.1**: A dataset for reading comprehension with 100,000+ questions.
- **SQuAD v2.0**: An extension of SQuAD v1.1 that includes unanswerable questions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BookCorpus**, the citation is:
  > Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever. *Language models are unsupervised multitask learners*. 2018.

- For **English Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever. *Language models are unsupervised multitask learners*. 2018.

- For **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Matthew E. Peters, Mark Neumann, Mohit Iyyer, Matt Gardner, Christopher Clark, Kenton Lee, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Deep contextualized word representations*. 2018.

- For **SQuAD v1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016.

- For **SQuAD v2.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the specified format. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented for future reference or analysis.
