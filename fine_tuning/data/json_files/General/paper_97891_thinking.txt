To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strength of Minibatch Noise in SGD" by Liu Ziyin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or results. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MNIST" or "CIFAR-10," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to ensure I have the correct citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are clear and accessible for future use or analysis.
