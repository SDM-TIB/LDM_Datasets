To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-based Automated Species Identification: Can Virtual Data Augmentation Overcome Problems of Insufficient Sampling?" by Morris Klasen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study assesses two empirical image datasets of scarab beetles, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **Material and Methods section**, specifically the **Datasets subsection**. Here, the authors describe two datasets in detail:

1. **Pleophylla Dataset**: This dataset consists of 112 specimens from 7 species, featuring images of female genitalia of the South African genus Pleophylla. The images are standardized in size (250x250 pixels) and are used for species identification.

2. **Schizonycha Dataset**: This dataset includes 76 specimens from 33 species, focusing on male copulation organs of the African genus Schizonycha. The images are larger (600x400 pixels) and are also standardized in orientation and background.

Both datasets are characterized by their challenging conditions for differentiation and identification due to low sample sizes and imbalanced distributions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the original studies that provided these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Pleophylla Dataset**:
  > Özgül-Siemund A., Ahrens D. 2015. Taxonomic utility of female copulation organs in Sericini chafers (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae), with special reference to asymmetry. *Contributions to Zoology* 84: 167–178.

- For the **Schizonycha Dataset**:
  > Eberle J., Walbaum W., Warnock R., Fabrizi S., Ahrens D. 2015. Asymmetry in genitalia does not increase the rate of their evolution. *Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution* 93: 180–187.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
