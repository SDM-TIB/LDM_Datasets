To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMEval: A Preliminary Study on How to Evaluate Large Language Models" by Yue Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **LLMEval** and provides some context about its purpose. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In this case, I will focus on the **Experiments** section, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they mention two datasets: **LLMEval-1** and **LLMEval-2**.

1. **LLMEval-1**: This dataset is designed to evaluate five criteria (accuracy, fluency, informativeness, logical coherence, and harmlessness) across 17 different types of questions, including factual questions, conversation, and math solving. The authors indicate that they collected a total of 453 questions for this dataset.

2. **LLMEval-2**: This dataset focuses on specialized domains and includes questions from 12 academic subjects, such as biological science, chemistry, and computer science. The authors created around 480 questions for this dataset, which includes both objective and subjective questions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are newly introduced in this paper, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the datasets are publicly available at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/llmeval.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and the relevant citation information:

- **LLMEval-1**: A dataset designed to evaluate LLMs across various criteria using 453 questions from 17 different types of tasks.
- **LLMEval-2**: A dataset focused on specialized domains, containing 480 questions from 12 academic subjects.

The citation for the datasets will be:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
