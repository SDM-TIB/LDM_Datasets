To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural network with optimal neuron activation functions based on additive Gaussian process regression" by Sergei Manzhos and Manabu Ihara, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate their approach by fitting potential energy surfaces (PES) of the water molecule and formaldehyde, which suggests that datasets related to these molecules are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for fitting the PES. They mention that they have a total of **10,000 data points in three dimensions** for H2O and **120,000 data points in six dimensions** for formaldehyde. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

In the **results section**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets, including the nature of the data points and their significance in the context of the study. They also mention that the data for H2O is available in the supplementary material of a referenced paper (Ref. 40), which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant references for the datasets are:

- For the **H2O dataset**, the citation is:
  > O. Ren, M.A. Boussaidi, D. Voytsekhovsky, M. Ihara, and S. Manzhos. *Computer Physics Communications*, 108220 (2021).

- For the **H2CO dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Manzhos and T. Carrington. *J. Chem. Phys.*, 145, 224110 (2016).

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **H2O Dataset**: Contains 10,000 data points in three dimensions representing Radau coordinates, with potential energy values ranging from 0-20,000 cm-1. The data is sourced from the analytic PES of the referenced paper.

2. **H2CO Dataset**: Comprises 120,000 data points in six dimensions, with potential energy values ranging from 0-17,000 cm-1, also sourced from the analytic PES of the referenced paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or processing.
