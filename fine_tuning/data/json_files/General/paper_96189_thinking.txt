To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence and Sample Complexity of SGD in GANs" by Vasilis Kontonis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field, as this may provide additional context or lead to the identification of datasets that are not explicitly mentioned in the experiments section.

Once I identify any datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the authors mention a custom dataset, I will note the details provided in the paper, such as the number of samples, features, and any specific methodologies used to collect or preprocess the data.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will format this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
