To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Adversarial Vulnerability through Causal Parameter Estimation by Adversarial Double Machine Learning" by Byung-Kwan Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various CNN and Transformer architectures using "four publicly available datasets." This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **Tiny-ImageNet**, and **ImageNet**. Each of these datasets is commonly used in the field of computer vision, particularly for tasks involving image classification.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will also check the **references section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7, 2015.

- **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 200 classes, each containing 500 training images.
   - Citation: Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7, 2015.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across more than 20,000 categories.
   - Citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
