To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leaving Reality to Imagination: Robust Classification via Generated Datasets" by Hritik Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors explore the impact of generated datasets on the robustness of image classifiers, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the performance of classifiers on various datasets. They mention the **ImageNet-1K** dataset as a benchmark for building robust classifiers, which is a key dataset for their experiments.

In the **setup section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. They specifically mention:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset contains 1.3 million labeled training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories. It is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet-1K, containing 100 classes randomly sampled from the larger dataset. This is used for analysis and ablation studies.

3. **Natural Distribution Shift Datasets**: The authors refer to several datasets that are used to evaluate the robustness of classifiers under natural distribution shifts, including:
   - **ImageNet-Sketch**: A dataset containing sketches of objects from ImageNet-1K.
   - **ImageNet-R**: A dataset containing renditions (paintings, sculptures) of objects from ImageNet-1K.
   - **ImageNet-V2**: A reproduction of the ImageNet-1K validation dataset.
   - **ObjectNet**: A dataset containing objects in novel backgrounds and rotations.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluate their classifiers on these datasets, which reinforces their relevance to the study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-Sketch**, the citation is:
  > Dongxu Li, et al. *ImageNet-Sketch: A Large-Scale Dataset for Sketch-Based Image Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019.

- For **ImageNet-R**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, Dan, et al. *ImageNet-R: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Natural Distribution Shifts*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2021.

- For **ImageNet-V2**, the citation is:
  > Recht, Benjamin, et al. *Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?* In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2019.

- For **ObjectNet**, the citation is:
  > Barbu, Andrei, et al. *ObjectNet: A Large-Scale Bias-Controlled Dataset for Pushing the Limits of Object Recognition Models*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
