To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NovGrid: A Flexible Grid World for Evaluating Agent Response to Novelty" by Jonathan Balloch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets that are provided.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of "MiniGrid" and "NOVGRID," as these terms suggest that the authors may have developed or utilized specific datasets or environments related to these frameworks. I will also check for any references to external datasets that may have been used in conjunction with NOVGRID.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MiniGrid environment**, I will look for the citation:
- Chevalier-Boisvert, M., Willems, L., & Pal, S. (2018). Minimalistic Gridworld Environment for OpenAI Gym. Retrieved from https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will follow the same process to ensure I capture their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
