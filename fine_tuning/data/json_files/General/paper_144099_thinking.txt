To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FINERCUT: Finer-grained Interpretable Layer Pruning for Large Language Models" by Yang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method across **9 benchmarks**, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In **Section 4.1 (Experiment setup)**, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments, which include:

1. **WikiText2**: A dataset for evaluating text generation performance by measuring perplexity.
2. **BoolQ**: A dataset containing yes/no questions for natural language understanding.
3. **ARC (AI2 Reasoning Challenge)**: A dataset with science exam questions.
4. **WinoGrande**: A commonsense reasoning dataset with fill-in-the-blank problems.
5. **HellaSwag**: A dataset for evaluating commonsense natural language inference.
6. **PIQA (Physical Interaction: Question Answering)**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.
7. **OpenbookQA**: A question-answering dataset based on open-book exams.
8. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: A dataset covering various academic disciplines.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, the citation for **WikiText2** is:
> Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

For **BoolQ**, the citation is:
> Clark, C., Lee, K., Chang, M.-W., Kwiatkowski, T., Collins, M., & Toutanova, K. (2019). BoolQ: Exploring the surprising difficulty of natural yes/no questions. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies.

I will continue this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This structured output will include all necessary details to ensure clarity and accessibility for future research or applications.
