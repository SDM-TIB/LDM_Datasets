To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Stochastic Transformer-based Approach for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Detection using Audio Recording of Clinical Interviews" by Mamadou Dia et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art performances on the **eDAIC dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specify that the model is trained and tested on the **Extended DAIC database (eDAIC)**. The authors describe this dataset as consisting of semi-clinical interviews aimed at identifying mental health disorders, including PTSD. They mention that the dataset includes 219 participant directories, each containing raw audio data, features, and labels based on the PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the eDAIC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **eDAIC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gratch, J., Artstein, R., et al. *The distress analysis interview corpus of human and computer interviews*. Tech. rep., UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES, 2014.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examining the experiments section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information.
