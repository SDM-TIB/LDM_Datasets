To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Contrastive BERT Fine-tuning for Fusion-based Reviewed-Item Retrieval" by Mohammad Mahdi Abdollah Pour et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a method for Reviewed-Item Retrieval (RIR) and hints at the need for labeled datasets, which suggests that datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they introduce the **Reviewed-Item Retrieval Dataset (RIRD)**, which they curated specifically for their analysis. This section provides details about the dataset, including its origin, the number of reviews, and the criteria for selecting the restaurants included in the dataset.

The authors state that the RIRD dataset consists of reviews related to 50 popular restaurants in Toronto, Canada, obtained from the Yelp dataset. They mention that the dataset contains a total of 29,000 reviews and that it was annotated by a group of annotators to assess the relevance of queries to the restaurants.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Yelp dataset, as it is the source of the reviews used in the RIRD dataset. The citation for the Yelp dataset is:

> Yelp Dataset. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned.

1. **Reviewed-Item Retrieval Dataset (RIRD)**: A dataset curated for the study, consisting of reviews from 50 restaurants in Toronto, Canada, with a total of 29,000 reviews.
   - Citation: Abdollah Pour, M. M., Farinneya, P., Toroghi, A., Korikov, A., Pesaranghader, A., Sajed, T., Bharadwaj, M., Mavrin, B., & Sanner, S. (2023). Self-Supervised Contrastive BERT Fine-tuning for Fusion-based Reviewed-Item Retrieval. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Page Numbers].

2. **Yelp Dataset**: The source of the reviews used in the RIRD dataset.
   - Citation: Yelp Dataset. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
