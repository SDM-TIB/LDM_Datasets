To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Lightweight Transformer via Group-wise Transformation for Vision-and-Language Tasks" by Gen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors applied their method to "a set of Transformer-based networks" and "quantitatively measure them on three vision-and-language tasks and six benchmark datasets." This indicates that datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section IV) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **VQA2.0 Dataset**: This dataset contains about 1.1 million image-question pairs, with 440K examples for training, 210K for validation, and 450K for testing.

2. **GQA Dataset**: This dataset includes 22 million questions over 140K images, designed to test visual reasoning ability in real scenes.

3. **CLEVR Dataset**: A synthetic dataset aimed at testing visual reasoning, containing 700K training examples and 150K test examples.

4. **RefCOCO Dataset**: Contains nearly 140K referring expressions for 50K bounding boxes across 20K images.

5. **RefCOCO+ Dataset**: Similar to RefCOCO but excludes spatial-related expressions and adds more appearance-related ones.

6. **COCO Captioning Dataset**: Contains over 120K images from MS-COCO, each annotated with 5 different captions.

7. **ImageNet-1K Dataset**: A widely-used benchmark for image classification, containing 1.28 million training images and 50K validation images.

8. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: Contains 60,000 low-resolution images from 100 classes, with 50,000 for training and 10,000 for validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
