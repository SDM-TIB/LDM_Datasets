To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are standard Object Segmentation models sufficient for Learning Affordance Segmentation?" by Hugo Caselles-Dupré et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between object segmentation and affordance segmentation, which may hint at the datasets used for these tasks. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **IIT-AFF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 8,835 real-world images, with around 60% sourced from the ImageNet dataset. It includes 10 object categories, 9 affordance classes, 14,642 object bounding boxes, and 24,677 affordance regions at the pixel level. The authors use a standard split of 70% for training and 30% for testing.

2. **UMD Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 30,000 RGB-D images of various objects in daily environments such as kitchens and gardens. It has 7 affordance classes and 17 object categories. The authors utilize only the RGB images and follow a specific split for training and testing.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **IIT-AFF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anh Nguyen, Dimitrios Kanoulas, Darwin G Caldwell, and Nikos G Tsagarakis. *Object-based affordances detection with convolutional neural networks and dense conditional random fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), pages 5908–5915, 2017.

- For the **UMD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Austin Myers, Ching L Teo, Cornelia Fermüller, and Yiannis Aloimonos. *Affordance detection of tool parts from geometric features*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 1374–1381, IEEE, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
