To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Learn More? Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Ali Jamali et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three newly created HSI benchmark datasets: **QUH-Pingan**, **QUH-Tangdaowan**, and **QUH-Qingyun**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (Section III) of the paper, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. Here’s what I will find:

1. **QUH-Tangdaowan Dataset**: This dataset was surveyed on May 18, 2021, in Tangdao Bay National Wetland Park, Qingdao, China. It consists of 176 bands with a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm and an image pixel size of 1740 × 860. The dataset includes training, validation, and test data for various land cover classes.

2. **QUH-Qingyun Dataset**: This dataset was surveyed on the same day in the vicinity of Qingyun Road primary school and residential area in Qingdao, China. It comprises 270 bands ranging from 400 to 1000 nm with an image pixel size of 880 x 1360. Similar to the Tangdaowan dataset, it includes training, validation, and test data for different classes.

3. **QUH-Pingan Dataset**: Collected on May 19, 2021, at Huangdao Pingan Passenger Ship Terminal in Qingdao, this dataset consists of 176 bands with a wavelength range of 400–1000 nm and an image pixel size of 1230 × 1000. It also includes training, validation, and test data for various classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are newly created and specific to this research, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the datasets are part of the authors' contributions and may not have been published elsewhere.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its relevant details, including the context of its creation and the classes it contains.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the paper itself, which will serve as the primary reference for the datasets:
- Ali Jamali, Swalpa Kumar Roy, Danfeng Hong, Bing Lu, and Pedram Ghamisi. *How to Learn More? Exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Hyperspectral Image Classification*. IEEE, 2024.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
