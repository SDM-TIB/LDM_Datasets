To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reasoning in Conversation: Solving Subjective Tasks through Dialogue Simulation for Large Language Models" by Xiaolong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method across twelve tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. They categorize the datasets into five types, which is a clear indication that I should list each dataset along with its description.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Metaphor Dataset**: This dataset is used to determine the accurate interpretation of metaphoric sentences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mohler, M., Brunson, M., Rink, B., & Tomlinson, M. (2016). Introducing the LCC metaphor datasets. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), pages 4221–4227, Portorož, Slovenia. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

2. **SNARKS Dataset**: This dataset focuses on distinguishing between sarcastic and non-sarcastic statements. The citation is:
   > Khodak, M., Saunshi, N., & Vodrahalli, K. (2018). A large self-annotated corpus for sarcasm. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), Miyazaki, Japan. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

3. **Dark Humor Detection Dataset**: This dataset aims to identify whether a given text is a dark humor joke. The citation is:
   > Hoffmann, J., Borgeaud, S., Mensch, A., et al. (2022). Training compute-optimal large language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.15556.

4. **Pronoun Resolution Dataset**: This dataset is used for disambiguating sentences by determining the referent of ambiguous pronouns. The citation is:
   > Rudinger, R., Naradowsky, J., Leonard, B., & Van Durme, B. (2018). Gender bias in coreference resolution. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 2 (Short Papers), pages 8–14, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

5. **Anachronism Recognition Dataset**: This dataset evaluates the capability of LLMs to detect anachronisms in sentences. The citation is:
   > Geva, M., Khashabi, D., Segal, E., et al. (2021). Did Aristotle use a laptop? A question answering benchmark with implicit reasoning strategies. TACL.

6. **SEQ Dataset**: This dataset assesses the capability of LLMs to match simple ethical questions with human judgment. The citation is:
   > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., et al. (2020). Aligning AI with shared human values. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.02275.

7. **SemEval Dataset**: This dataset introduces a series of opinion analysis tasks. The citation is:
   > Mohammad, S. M., Kiritchenko, S., & Zhu, X. (2016). SemEval-2016 task 6: Detecting stance in tweets. In Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), pages 31–41, San Diego, California. Association for Computational Linguistics.

8. **SocNorm Dataset**: This dataset reflects social norms in American and Chinese culture. The citation is:
   > CH-Wang, S., Saakyan, A., Li, O., et al. (2023). Sociocultural norm similarities and differences via situational alignment and explainable textual entailment. In Proc. of EMNLP.

9. **e-SocNorm Dataset**: This dataset extends the SocNorm dataset with free-text explanations. The citation is:
   > CH-Wang, S., Saakyan, A., Li, O., et al. (2023). Sociocultural norm similarities and differences via situational alignment and explainable textual entailment. In Proc. of EMNLP.

10. **CALI Dataset**: This dataset contains culturally aware premise-hypothesis pairs. The citation is:
    > Huang, J., & Yang, D. (2023). Culturally aware natural language inference. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, pages 7591–7609, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

11. **Analytic Entailment Dataset**: This dataset seeks to determine the truth of the second sentence based on the first. The citation is:
    > Srivastava, A., Rastogi, A., Rao, A., et al. (2022). Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04615.

12. **IPA Dataset**: This dataset is a natural language inference task presented in the international phonetic alphabet. The citation is:
    > Williams, A. B., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proc. of NAACL.

After identifying and documenting each dataset along with its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
