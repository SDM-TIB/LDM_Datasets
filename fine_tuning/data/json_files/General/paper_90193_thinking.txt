To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaze-Sensing LEDs for Head Mounted Displays" by Kaan Aksit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction discusses gaze tracking and its applications but does not specify any datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted subjective tests and evaluations using their gaze tracking prototypes, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they describe the data collection process involving human subjects during their experiments. They mention that they collected calibration data from users during gaze estimation tasks, but this data does not correspond to a named dataset that can be cited.

Since there are no specific datasets referenced in the paper, I will note that while the authors conducted experiments with human subjects, they did not utilize any established datasets from the literature. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none were explicitly mentioned.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings, noting that the paper does not reference any external datasets but instead relies on data collected from experimental subjects during the study. This will be important for anyone looking to understand the data context of the research.
