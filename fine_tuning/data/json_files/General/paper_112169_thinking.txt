To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linear Precoder Design in Massive MIMO under Realistic Power Amplifier Consumption Constraint" by Emanuele Peschiera and Fran√ßois Rottenberg, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the energy consumption of wireless networks and the design of precoders, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and numerical results sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for their simulations or analyses. In this case, the paper does not seem to describe any specific datasets used for training or testing, as it primarily focuses on theoretical models and numerical simulations.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the text, I will check the **References section** to see if any external datasets are cited that could be relevant to the work. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing theoretical aspects of MIMO systems and power consumption, rather than specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not provide any datasets or references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in the paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide. If I were to find datasets, I would ensure to extract their names, descriptions, and full citations as per the required format. However, in this case, it appears that the focus is on theoretical contributions rather than empirical data.
