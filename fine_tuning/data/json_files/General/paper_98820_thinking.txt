To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Reweighted Gradient Descent" by Ayoub El Hanchi and David A. Stephens, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for empirical validation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. In this paper, I will specifically look for any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention four datasets from LIBSVM used for their experiments: **ijcnn1**, **w8a**, **mushrooms**, and **phishing**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their purpose and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors typically cite the original sources of the datasets, which is crucial for proper attribution. 

For the datasets mentioned, I will gather the following citations:

1. **ijcnn1 Dataset**: 
   > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(3).

2. **w8a Dataset**: 
   > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(3).

3. **mushrooms Dataset**: 
   > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(3).

4. **phishing Dataset**: 
   > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). *LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 2(3).

Since all four datasets are sourced from the same library, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation. This structured approach will ensure that I have comprehensively extracted and cited the datasets used in the research paper.
