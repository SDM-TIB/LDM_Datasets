To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Provably Effective Method for Pruning Experts in Fine-tuned Sparse Mixture-of-Experts" by Mohammed Nowaz Rabbani Chowdhury et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors verified their expert pruning method on large vision MoE models fine-tuned on benchmark datasets such as **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for more detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In this section, the authors confirm that they evaluated their method on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** datasets, providing additional context about their application in the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Canadian Institute For Advanced Research, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Canadian Institute For Advanced Research, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.
