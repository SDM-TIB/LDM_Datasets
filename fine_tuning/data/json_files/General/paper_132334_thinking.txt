To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A CHAT ABOUT BORING PROBLEMS: STUDYING GPT-BASED TEXT NORMALIZATION" by Yang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "Google TN dataset," which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, specifically **section 2.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they describe the Google TN dataset as comprising around 1.1 billion words from Wikipedia, which is significant for text normalization tasks. They also mention that the dataset includes domain tags and target normalizations generated with Googleâ€™s Kestrel TN system.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google TN dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Google TN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Sproat and Navdeep Jaitly. *An RNN model of text normalization*. In Interspeech, 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset's details:

1. **Google TN Dataset**: This dataset is comprised of approximately 1.1 billion words sourced from Wikipedia. It is one of the few publicly available English text normalization datasets and provides extensive coverage of common text normalization domains. The dataset pairs individual tokens with domain tags and includes target normalizations generated by Google's Kestrel TN system.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
