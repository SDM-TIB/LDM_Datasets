To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning under Privileged Information Using Heteroscedastic Dropout" by John Lambert et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses datasets. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments: **ImageNet** and **Multi-30K**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **ImageNet**: The authors describe it as a dataset of 1.3 million labeled images spanning 1000 categories, but they specifically use a subset of 600,000 images that include localization information. This detail is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

2. **Multi-30K**: This dataset consists of 30,000 Flickr images that are captioned in both English and German. The authors highlight its relevance for multi-modal machine translation experiments, emphasizing that the English captions are directly annotated for images while the German captions are translations of the English captions. This distinction is important for understanding the dataset's role in the context of privileged information.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

- For **Multi-30K**, the citation is:
  > D. Elliott, S. Frank, K. Sima’an, and L. Specia. *Multi30K: Multilingual English-German Image Descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation, pages 70–74, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included. This will facilitate further processing or review of the extracted dataset information.
