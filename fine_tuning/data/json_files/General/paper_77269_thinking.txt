To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Katyusha X: Practical Momentum Method for Stochastic Sum-of-Nonconvex Optimization" by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly listed. I will look for any subsections that discuss the datasets used for evaluation, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In this paper, the authors mention using synthetic datasets for their experiments, but they do not provide specific names for these datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are synthetic and describe their general characteristics based on the context provided in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. Since the paper primarily discusses synthetic datasets, there may not be formal citations, but I will ensure to document any relevant references that may provide context or background for the datasets used.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as well as any relevant citations for the datasets if applicable.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the steps I will take:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify specific datasets used.
3. Note that the datasets are synthetic and describe their characteristics.
4. Check the References section for any relevant citations.
5. Compile the information, including full citations for the paper and any datasets mentioned.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
