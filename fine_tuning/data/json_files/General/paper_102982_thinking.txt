To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Passage Re-ranking with Contextualized Exact Term Matching and Efficient Passage Expansion" by Shengyao Zhuang and Guido Zuccon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the TILDEv2 model and its efficiency improvements, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Moving to the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

In the **experimental settings section (Section 4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments: 

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is described as providing approximately 1 million queries, with relevance judgments associated with each query. It is a large-scale passage ranking dataset.

2. **TREC Deep Learning 2019**: This dataset is noted for having a small query set with deep judgments on a four-point scale, which allows for a more nuanced evaluation of ranking effectiveness.

3. **TREC Deep Learning 2020**: Similar to the 2019 dataset, this dataset also provides a small query set with deep judgments, facilitating comparisons with past and future work.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@ NIPS, 2016.

- For **TREC Deep Learning 2019**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, and Daniel Campos. *Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07662, 2021.

- For **TREC Deep Learning 2020**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Campos, and Ellen M Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MS MARCO**: A large-scale passage ranking dataset with approximately 1 million queries.
   - Citation: Tri Nguyen et al. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. In CoCo@ NIPS, 2016.

2. **TREC Deep Learning 2019**: A dataset with a small query set and deep judgments.
   - Citation: Nick Craswell et al. *Overview of the TREC 2020 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.07662, 2021.

3. **TREC Deep Learning 2020**: Similar to the 2019 dataset, providing a small query set with deep judgments.
   - Citation: Nick Craswell et al. *Overview of the TREC 2019 deep learning track*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.07820, 2020.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
