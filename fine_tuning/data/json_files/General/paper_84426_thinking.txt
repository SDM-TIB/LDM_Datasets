To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse KL-Divergence Training of Prior Networks: Improved Uncertainty and Adversarial Robustness" by Andrey Malinin and Mark Gales, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Prior Networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Image Classification Experiments)**, where the authors present results on various datasets. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains over 600,000 digit images.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset with 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
5. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 200 classes and 500 training images per class.

In **section 6 (Adversarial Attack Detection)**, the authors again reference CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford CS231N. *Tiny ImageNet*. 2017. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
