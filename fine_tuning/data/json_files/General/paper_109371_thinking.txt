To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UNIMO-2: End-to-End Unified Vision-Language Grounded Learning" by Wei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings** section, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention three types of datasets: text corpus, image corpus, and image-text pairs. I will look for specific names and details about these datasets.

In the **experimental settings** section, the authors list the following datasets:

1. **BookWiki**: A large-scale text corpus used for pre-training.
2. **OpenWebText**: Another large-scale text corpus utilized in the study.
3. **OpenImages**: A dataset containing images without textual descriptions, which is part of the image corpus.
4. **ImageNet-21k**: A large-scale image dataset that includes images with textual labels.
5. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: A widely used dataset for image captioning and object detection, consisting of images and their corresponding captions.
6. **Visual Genome (VG)**: A dataset that connects language and vision through dense image annotations.
7. **Conceptual Captions (CC)**: A dataset for image captioning that provides a cleaned and hypernymed image alt-text dataset.
8. **SBU Captions**: A dataset that contains image captions for automatic image captioning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
