To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Applicability of Synthetic Data for Face Recognition" by Haoyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper investigates synthetic face images generated with StyleGAN and StyleGAN2, which suggests that datasets related to these methods may be discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Dataset"** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset is used for training the StyleGAN and StyleGAN2 models. The authors note that it contains high-quality human face images webcrawled from a social media platform (Flickr) and covers a wide variation of soft biometrics such as ethnicity and gender.

2. **FRGC (Face Recognition Grand Challenge) Dataset**: The authors utilize a subset of this dataset, specifically the FRGC-V2, which contains 24,025 images. This dataset is chosen for its high-quality images that resemble the conditions of border control scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 4401–4410.

- For **FRGC**, the citation is:
  > Phillips, P. J., Flynn, P. J., Scruggs, T., Bowyer, K. W., Chang, J., Hoffman, K., Marques, J., Min, J., & Worek, W. (2005). *Overview of the face recognition grand challenge*. In 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 947–954 vol. 1.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their relevant details for future reference or analysis.
