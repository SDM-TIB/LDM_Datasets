To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressing Large-Scale Transformer-Based Models: A Case Study on BERT" by Prakhar Ganesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of large pre-trained models and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from the **General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark** and the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)**. I will note these datasets as they are critical for understanding the context of the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify the tasks associated with these datasets:
1. **GLUE benchmark**: This includes tasks like MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference), QQP (Quora Question Pairs), and SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).
2. **SQuAD**: Specifically, they mention SQuAD v1.1 for machine reading comprehension.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, J., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. (2018). GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. In Proceedings of the 2018 EMNLP Workshop BlackboxNLP: Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP, pages 353–355.

- For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
