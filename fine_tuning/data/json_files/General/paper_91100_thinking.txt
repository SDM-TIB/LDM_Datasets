To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pedestrian Path, Pose and Intention Prediction through Gaussian Process Dynamical Models and Pedestrian Activity Recognition" by RaÃºl Quintero et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals, but I need to look for specific dataset names and descriptions in the main body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (System Description)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using a dataset published by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) for training their models. They provide details about the dataset, including the frequency of data collection (120 Hz) and the number of joints tracked (41 joints). They also specify that a subset of 11 joints was selected for their analysis.

The authors then introduce the **CMU-UAH dataset**, which is derived from the original CMU dataset. They explain that this dataset consists of 490 sequences of pedestrian activities, including walking, starting, stopping, and standing, with a total of 302,470 poses from 31 different subjects. This is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the original CMU dataset is as follows:
- **CMU Motion Capture Database**: 
  > Carnegie Mellon University. *CMU Motion Capture Database*. Available: http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/.

For the CMU-UAH dataset, since it is a derived dataset from the original CMU dataset, I will cite it as follows:
- **CMU-UAH Dataset**: 
  > Quintero, R., Parra, I., Llorca, D. F., & Sotelo, M. A. (2023). *Pedestrian Path, Pose and Intention Prediction through Gaussian Process Dynamical Models and Pedestrian Activity Recognition*. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation for proper attribution in any future work or analysis.
