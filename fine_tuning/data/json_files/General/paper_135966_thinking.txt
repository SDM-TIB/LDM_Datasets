To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of AI-Generated (GPT-4) and Human-crafted MCQs in Programming Education" by Jacob Doughty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves analyzing multiple-choice questions (MCQs) generated by GPT-4 and human authors, which suggests that there are datasets related to these MCQs.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Set)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention assembling a dataset of **246 module-level learning objectives (LOs)** from four Python programming courses and two introductory data science courses. They also state that they collected **449 human-crafted MCQs** for comparison.

In this section, I will note the details of the datasets:

1. **Module-level Learning Objectives Dataset**: This dataset consists of 246 LOs derived from four Python programming courses and two introductory data science courses. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be original work.

2. **Human-crafted MCQs Dataset**: This dataset includes 449 manually created MCQs, which were collected to compare against the LLM-generated MCQs. Similar to the LOs, the authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is also original work.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are original and created by the authors, there may not be external citations for them.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant citations. Since the datasets are original, I will note that in the citation section.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
