To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Beam-Space Active Sensing Scheme for Integrated Communication and Sensing Applications" by Saeid K. Dehkordi and Giuseppe Caire, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly described. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that detail the datasets used for simulations or evaluations. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to the performance evaluation of the proposed sensing schemes. If the authors mention using any publicly available datasets or if they have created their own datasets for the experiments, I will document these accordingly.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to use the datasets in their own research.
