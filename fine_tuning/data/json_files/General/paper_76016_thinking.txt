To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Nets with Interpolating Function as Output Activation" by Bao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the advantages of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. In this section, I will look for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
4. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains over 600,000 digit images obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **CIFAR100**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- **MNIST**: 
  > Yann LeCun. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- **SVHN**: 
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
