To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards More Effective PRM-based Crowd Counting via A Multi-resolution Fusion and Attention Network" by Usman Sajid and Guanghui Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on **four benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section (Section 5)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **UCF-QNRF Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,535 images with a total of 1,251,642 people annotations. It is noted for its wide range of crowd density and varying image resolutions.

2. **ShanghaiTech Dataset**: This dataset is divided into two parts: Part-A with 482 images and Part-B with 716 images. Part-A has a total of 241,677 human annotations, while Part-B has 88,488 annotations.

3. **AHU-Crowd Dataset**: This dataset consists of 107 images with a total of 45,807 people annotations, presenting a significant challenge due to its varying statistics.

4. **WorldExpo’10 Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,980 annotated frames collected from 1,132 video sequences across 108 different scenes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
