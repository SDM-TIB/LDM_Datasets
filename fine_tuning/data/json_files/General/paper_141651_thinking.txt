To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge" by Giovanni Ciatto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in the context of the nutritional domain, as the authors state that they report experiments rooted in this area. I will pay attention to any references to datasets that were used to populate the ontology or to validate the KGFiller method.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Food-101" or "Recipe1M", I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the details provided in the paper and search for the original sources online to ensure accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
