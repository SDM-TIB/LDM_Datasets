        "dcterms:description": "The solder joint defect dataset contained 3154 defective solder joint images obtained using a Couple-Charged Device (CCD) industrial camera. There are two types of defects, namely ineffective and foot shifting. Among them, 1680 are ineffective defects and 1474 are foot shifting defects. The dataset is randomly divided into training sets, validation sets, and test sets, with a division ratio of 80%, 10%, and 10%, for model training, validation, and testing.",
