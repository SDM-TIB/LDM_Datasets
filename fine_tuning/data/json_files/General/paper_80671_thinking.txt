To extract datasets from the research paper titled "R-CNNs for Pose Estimation and Action Detection" by Georgia Gkioxari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to their research. The introduction further elaborates on the tasks of pose estimation and action classification, hinting at the datasets used for these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets & Evaluation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Detection Dataset**: This dataset is used for the pose estimation task, specifically the subset that includes people with keypoint annotations. The authors describe how they split the dataset into training and validation sets for their experiments.

2. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Action Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for the action classification task. The authors mention that it consists of images with bounding boxes and action labels, and they also describe how they augmented the dataset for action detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose in the research, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation.
