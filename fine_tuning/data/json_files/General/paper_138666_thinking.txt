To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pedagogical Alignment of Large Language Models" by Shashank Sonkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly section 4, where the authors discuss their experimental design and dataset construction. Here, they mention the need for a conversational dataset to train and test their models. They specifically refer to the **CLASS conversational dataset** and describe its structure and purpose.

In section 4.1, the authors detail the dataset used for training and testing, which includes:

1. **CLASS Conversational Dataset (Dc)**: This dataset comprises 610 conversations generated using the CLASS framework, which includes student-tutor interactions. Each conversation consists of student utterances and corresponding tutor responses.

2. **Preference Dataset (Dp)**: This dataset is constructed from the CLASS dataset and includes interactions where the pedagogically preferred tutor responses are distinguished from less effective ones. It is designed to be compatible with reinforcement learning algorithms.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or frameworks mentioned. The CLASS framework is cited in the references, which will provide the necessary citation for the dataset.

The citation for the CLASS framework is:
> Shashank Sonkar, Naiming Liu, Debshila Mallick, and Richard Baraniuk. *CLASS: A Design Framework for Building Intelligent Tutoring Systems Based on Learning Science principles*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, pages 1941â€“1961, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
