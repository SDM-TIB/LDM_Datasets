To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Free Diversity-Based Ensemble Selection For One-Shot Federated Learning in Machine Learning Model Market" by Naibo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method was evaluated on **5 datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **5 image datasets** and provide details about the datasets and their configurations in **Table I**. I will carefully extract the names and descriptions of these datasets from this table.

The datasets listed in Table I are:

1. **EMNIST Digits**: A dataset containing handwritten digits, with a total size of 280,000 samples.
2. **EMNIST Letters**: A dataset containing handwritten letters, with a total size of 145,600 samples.
3. **EMNIST Balanced**: A balanced version of the EMNIST dataset, containing 131,600 samples.
4. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 color images in 10 classes.
5. **CIFAR100**: A dataset containing 60,000 color images in 100 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are well-known, I can provide standard citations based on common knowledge:

- For **EMNIST Digits**:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Cowan, W. (2017). *EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

- For **EMNIST Letters**:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Cowan, W. (2017). *EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

- For **EMNIST Balanced**:
  > Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & Cowan, W. (2017). *EMNIST: An extension of MNIST to handwritten letters*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1702.05373.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
