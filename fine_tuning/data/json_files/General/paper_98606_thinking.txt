To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Code Summarization with Block-wise Abstract Syntax Tree Splitting" by Chen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "comprehensive experiments on benchmarks have demonstrated that BASTS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section VI) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they used two public benchmarks: the **Java dataset** and the **Python dataset**. 

1. **Java Dataset**: The authors describe it as being collected from GitHub’s Java repositories. They provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **Python Dataset**: This dataset is provided by the CodeSearchNet challenge, and they also include a link for reference.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and reproducibility.

- For the **Java dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hu, X., Li, G., Xia, X., Lo, D., & Jin, Z. (2018). Deep code comment generation. In ICPC (pp. 200–210). 

- For the **Python dataset**, the citation is:
  > Husain, H., Wu, H., Gazit, T., Allamanis, M., & Brockschmidt, M. (2019). Codesearchnet challenge: Evaluating the state of semantic code search. arXiv Preprint, 2019. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
