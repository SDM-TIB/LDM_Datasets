To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parameter Convex Neural Networks" by Jingcheng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a graph classification dataset, which indicates that datasets are involved. However, it does not specify the names of the datasets, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists three datasets: **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, and **PubMed**. Each dataset is described with specific details such as the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and the number of training, validation, and test nodes.

I will extract the following details for each dataset:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2708
   - Number of Edges: 5429
   - Number of Features: 1433
   - Number of Classes: 7
   - Training Nodes: 140
   - Validation Nodes: 500
   - Test Nodes: 1000

2. **CiteSeer**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 3327
   - Number of Edges: 4732
   - Number of Features: 3703
   - Number of Classes: 6
   - Training Nodes: 120
   - Validation Nodes: 500
   - Test Nodes: 1000

3. **PubMed**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19717
   - Number of Edges: 44338
   - Number of Features: 500
   - Number of Classes: 3
   - Training Nodes: 60
   - Validation Nodes: 500
   - Test Nodes: 1000

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:

- For **Cora**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **CiteSeer**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For **PubMed**:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Since all three datasets are referenced from the same source, I will ensure to note that in the dataset descriptions.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, details, and the full citation. This will allow for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
