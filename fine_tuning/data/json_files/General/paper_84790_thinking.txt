To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding" by Zhilin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that XLNet outperforms BERT on various tasks, which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of their model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **BooksCorpus**: A dataset consisting of 11,038 books, used for pretraining the model.
2. **English Wikipedia**: A well-known dataset used for pretraining.
3. **Giga5**: A dataset containing 16GB of text data, also used for pretraining.
4. **ClueWeb 2012-B**: A dataset used for document ranking tasks.
5. **Common Crawl**: A large-scale web corpus used for pretraining.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional datasets mentioned, particularly in the context of specific tasks like reading comprehension or text classification.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **BooksCorpus**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 19â€“27.

- For **Giga5**, the citation is:
  > Parker, R., Graff, D., Kong, J., Chen, K., & Maeda, K. (2011). English Gigaword Fifth Edition. Linguistic Data Consortium.

- For **ClueWeb 2012-B**, the citation is:
  > Callan, J., Hoy, M., Yoo, C., & Zhao, L. (2009). ClueWeb09 Data Set.

- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. (2019). Common Crawl. URL: http://commoncrawl.org.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
