To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "A Transformer-Based Siamese Network for Change Detection" by Wele Gedara Chaminda Bandara and Vishal M. Patel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on two change detection datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used two publicly available change detection datasets:

1. **LEVIR-CD**: This dataset is described as a building change detection dataset containing remote sensing image pairs of resolution 1024 × 1024. The authors mention that they crop non-overlapping patches of size 256 × 256 and split them into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **DSIFN-CD**: This dataset is described as a general change detection dataset that includes changes in various land-cover objects. The authors explain that they create non-overlapping patches of size 256 × 256 from the images and utilize the authors' default train/val/test splits.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **LEVIR-CD**, the citation is:
  > Chen, H., & Shi, Z. (2020). A spatial-temporal attention-based method and a new dataset for remote sensing image change detection. *Remote Sensing*, 12(10), 1662.

- For **DSIFN-CD**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, C., Yue, P., Tapete, D., Jiang, L., Shangguan, B., Huang, L., & Liu, G. (2020). A deeply supervised image fusion network for change detection in high resolution bi-temporal remote sensing images. *ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing*, 166, 183–200.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.
