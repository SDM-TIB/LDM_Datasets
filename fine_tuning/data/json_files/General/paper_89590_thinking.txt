To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of Pre-training Models in Named Entity Recognition" by Yu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **MSRA-2006 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The introduction discusses the importance of NER and mentions various pre-training models but does not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** for more details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **MSRA-2006 dataset** for their experiments. This confirms that this dataset is central to their research findings.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MSRA-2006 dataset**. The dataset is referenced in the context of previous works, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation. The citation for the MSRA-2006 dataset is:

> G. Wu, G. Tang, Z. Wang, Z. Zhang, and Z. Wang. *An Attention-Based BiLSTM-CRF Model for Chinese Clinic Named Entity Recognition*. IEEE ACCESS, 2019.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the application of pre-training models and only mentions the MSRA-2006 dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry, ensuring that the citation is included accurately and completely. This will provide a clear reference for anyone reviewing the datasets used in this research.
