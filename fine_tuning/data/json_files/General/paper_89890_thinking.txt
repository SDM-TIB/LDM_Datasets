To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Time-Delay Transformer for Real-Time Punctuation Prediction and Disfluency Detection" by Qian Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on the **IWSLT2011 benchmark dataset** and an **in-house Chinese annotated dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **IWSLT2011 Dataset**: This dataset is used for punctuation prediction and contains three types of punctuation marks (comma, period, and question mark). The authors note that it consists of 2 million words in the training set, 296,000 words in the development set, and 13,000 words in the test set.

2. **In-house Chinese Annotated Dataset**: This dataset is used for both punctuation prediction and disfluency detection. The authors indicate that it contains approximately 240,000 spoken utterances, which have been annotated for punctuation and disfluency. The training set has 5 million words, while the development and test sets contain 132,000 and 93,000 words, respectively.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used both the **IWSLT2011 benchmark dataset** and the **in-house Chinese annotated dataset** for their evaluations, reinforcing their importance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The IWSLT2011 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I can find its citation easily. However, since the in-house Chinese dataset is not publicly available, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created by the authors.

The full citation for the **IWSLT2011 dataset** is:
> Xiaoyin Che, Cheng Wang, Haojin Yang, and Christoph Meinel. "Punctuation prediction for unsegmented transcript based on word vector." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2016.

For the **in-house Chinese annotated dataset**, I will note that it does not have a formal citation since it is not publicly available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable, and prepare them for structured output.
