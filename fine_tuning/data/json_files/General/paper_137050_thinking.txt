To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SecFormer: Towards Fast and Accurate Privacy-Preserving Inference for Large Language Models" by Jinglong Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of SecFormer on the GLUE benchmark datasets, which suggests that these datasets are relevant for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 5.1), where the authors describe the models and datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that they selected a subset of tasks from the GLUE benchmark, which includes:

1. **Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)**: A dataset used for natural language inference tasks.
2. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
3. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: A dataset for assessing the grammatical acceptability of sentences.
4. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**: A dataset for measuring the semantic similarity between sentence pairs.
5. **Question Natural Language Inference (QNLI)**: A dataset for question-answering tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the GLUE benchmark datasets. The GLUE benchmark is a well-known collection of datasets, and the citation for it is:

- For the GLUE benchmark:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, OpenReview.net, 2019.

Since the datasets used in the GLUE benchmark are widely recognized, I will use the GLUE benchmark citation as the authoritative reference for the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the GLUE benchmark, and prepare them for structured output.
