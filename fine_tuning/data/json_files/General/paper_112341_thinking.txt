To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancement of Rural Connectivity by Recycling TV Towers with Massive MIMO Techniques" by Ammar El Falou and Mohamed-Slim Alouini, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of TV towers for connectivity, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **system model and results sections** to see if any specific datasets are used for simulations or case studies. The authors mention using population density maps and locations of existing cellular sites and TV towers in Ethiopia, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **mapping to a real case section**, the authors refer to population density data obtained from Facebook/Meta and the locations of cellular sites and TV towers from other sources. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract:

1. **Population Density Data**: This dataset is sourced from Facebook/Meta, which provides high-resolution population density maps. The authors mention that this data is crucial for their analysis of rural connectivity in Ethiopia.

2. **Cellular Sites and TV Towers Data**: The authors state that the locations of legacy cellular sites and TV towers are obtained from a specific source, which is referenced as [14] and [15] in the paper. This indicates that there are datasets related to the geographical locations of these infrastructures.

Now, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **population density data**, the citation is:
  > Meta Engineering. High-resolution population density maps. [Online], Accessed June 2022. Available at: https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/high-resolution-population-density-maps.

- For the **cellular sites and TV towers data**, the citation is:
  > Unwired Labs. “cell towers.csv.gz”. [Online], Accessed February 2022. Available at: https://opencellid.org/downloads.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
