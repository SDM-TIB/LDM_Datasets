To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient-Free Structured Pruning with Unlabeled Data" by Azade Nova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **GLUE** and **SQuAD** benchmarks, which indicates that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section, which provides more detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors describe the GLUE benchmark, which includes several tasks such as QQP, MRPC, SST-2, MNLI, and QNLI, along with their respective training example counts. They also mention the SQuAD datasets, specifically SQuAD 1.1 and SQuAD 2.0, detailing the number of training examples for each.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This benchmark consists of multiple tasks:
   - **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: 364,000 training examples.
   - **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: 4,000 training examples.
   - **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: 67,000 training examples.
   - **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: 392,000 training examples.
   - **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: 105,000 training examples.

2. **SQuAD Datasets**:
   - **SQuAD 1.1**: 88,000 training examples.
   - **SQuAD 2.0**: 130,000 training examples, which includes unanswerable questions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GLUE**:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Glue: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461.

- For **SQuAD 1.1**:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). Squad: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250.

  > Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2018). Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for squad. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03822.

With this information gathered, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
