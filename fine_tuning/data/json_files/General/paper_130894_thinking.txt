To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness of Compressed Deep Learning Models" by Brijesh Vora et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on "two standard datasets â€“ CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100." This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **methodology section**. In section 3.2, the authors explicitly state that they trained their models on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. They provide a brief overview of these datasets, noting that CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while CIFAR-100 contains 60,000 images in 100 classes.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Since both datasets are from the same source, I will ensure to note that they share the same citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
