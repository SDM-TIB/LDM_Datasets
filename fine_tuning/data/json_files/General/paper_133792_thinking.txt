To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Ranking Contrastive Learning: A Extremely Simple yet Efficient Method" by Sheng Ouyang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for node classification, link prediction, and graph classification tasks. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **Cora**: A citation network dataset with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, and 7 classes.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset with 3,312 nodes, 4,732 edges, and 6 classes.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, and 3 classes.
4. **Photo**: A product co-purchasing network with 7,650 nodes and 119,081 edges.
5. **Computer**: Another product co-purchasing dataset with 13,752 nodes and 245,861 edges.
6. **CS**: A co-authorship network with 1,433 nodes and 3,703 edges.
7. **Physics**: Another co-authorship network with 8,415 nodes and 7,000 edges.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were split for training, validation, and testing. This information is crucial for understanding the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets, which is essential for proper attribution. For example:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In International conference on machine learning, 2016.

- For **CiteSeer**, the citation is:
  > Pinar Yanardag and SVN Vishwanathan. *Deep graph kernels*. In Proceedings of the 21st ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining, 2015.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting semi-supervised learning with graph embeddings*. In International conference on machine learning, 2016.

- For **Photo** and **Computer**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl. *Snap Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. 2014.

- For **CS** and **Physics**, the citation is:
  > Jure Leskovec, Kevin J. Lang, and Michael W. Mahoney. *Empirical comparison of algorithms for network community detection*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2010.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
