To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fair Abstractive Summarization of Diverse Perspectives" by Yusen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods on **six datasets collected from social media, online reviews, and recorded transcripts**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (PERSPECTIVESUMM)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention that they curated a benchmark called **PERSPECTIVESUMM** by unifying and cleaning six existing datasets. The paper provides a table (Table 1) that summarizes the characteristics of these datasets, including their domains, sources, attributes, and sample sizes.

The six datasets mentioned are:

1. **Claritin Dataset**: This dataset contains tweets about the effects of the drug Claritin, annotated with gender. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Shandilya, A., Ghosh, K., & Chakraborty, A. (2018). Fairness of extractive text summarization. In Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference 2018, pages 97–98.

2. **US Election Dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets from the 2016 US Presidential election, annotated with political stance. The citation is the same as for the Claritin dataset:
   > Shandilya, A., Ghosh, K., & Chakraborty, A. (2018). Fairness of extractive text summarization. In Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference 2018, pages 97–98.

3. **Amazon Dataset**: This dataset includes product reviews from Amazon, annotated with ratings. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bražinskas, A., Lapata, M., & Titov, I. (2020). Few-shot learning for opinion summarization. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

4. **Yelp Dataset**: Similar to the Amazon dataset, this contains business reviews from Yelp, annotated with sentiment. The citation is also:
   > Bražinskas, A., Lapata, M., & Titov, I. (2020). Few-shot learning for opinion summarization. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

5. **SupremeCourt Dataset**: This dataset consists of transcripts from U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments, annotated with speaker information. The citation is:
   > Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, C., Lee, L., Pang, B., & Kleinberg, J. (2012). Echoes of power: Language effects and power differences in social interaction. In Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on World Wide Web, pages 699–708.

6. **Intelligence Squared Debate Dataset (IQ2)**: This dataset collects public debates recorded live, annotated with speaker information. The citation is:
   > Zhang, Y., Liu, Y., Zeng, R., & Radev, D. (2016). Conversational flow in Oxford-style debates. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 136–141.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
