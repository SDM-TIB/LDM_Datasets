To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "On the Calibration of Massively Multilingual Language Models" by Kabir Ahuja et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on calibration issues in multilingual models, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction, however, discusses various multilingual language models and hints at the evaluation of these models on specific tasks, which may lead to dataset mentions.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The paper mentions four datasets:

1. **XNLI**: A Natural Language Inference task dataset that includes translations of English sentences into 14 other languages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alexis Conneau, Ruty Rinott, Guillaume Lample, Adina Williams, Samuel Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2018, pages 2475–2485.

2. **XCOPA**: A multilingual benchmark for causal commonsense reasoning, which extends the COPA dataset to multiple languages. The citation is:
   > Edoardo Maria Ponti, Ivan Vulić, Ryan Cotterell, Marinela Parovic, Roi Reichart, and Anna Korhonen. *XCOPA: A multilingual dataset for causal commonsense reasoning*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2362–2376.

3. **MARC**: The Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus, which contains product reviews in multiple languages. The citation is:
   > Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, György Szarvas, and Noah A. Smith. *The multilingual amazon reviews corpus*. CoRR, abs/2010.02573.

4. **PAWS-X**: An adversarial dataset for multilingual paraphrase detection, adapted from the original PAWS dataset. The citation is:
   > Yinhan Liu, Jiatao Gu, Naman Goyal, Xian Li, Sergey Edunov, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Mike Lewis, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *PAWS-X: A cross-lingual adversarial dataset for paraphrase identification*. In Proceedings of EMNLP 2019, pages 3685–3690.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct details for each dataset, including their purpose and the languages they cover, as described in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
