To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker embeddings by modeling channel-wise correlations" by Themos Stafylakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on **VoxCeleb**, which suggests that this dataset is relevant to the study.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation on the **VoxCeleb 1 and 2 datasets**. This section provides specific details about the datasets used, including the number of speakers and utterances, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors describe the **VoxCeleb 1 dataset** as containing a test set composed of only 40 speakers, while the **VoxCeleb 2 dataset** is mentioned as a larger and more representative dataset used for training, containing 5750 speakers and approximately 4.9 million utterances. This information is essential for accurately documenting the datasets.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **VoxCeleb dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Nagrani, J. S. Chung, and A. Zisserman. "Voxceleb: a large-scale speaker identification dataset." In INTERSPEECH, 2017, pp. 2616â€“2620.

- The **Kaldi Speech Recognition Toolkit**, which is also referenced in the paper, is cited as:
  > D. Povey, A. Ghoshal, G. Boulianne, L. Burget, O. Glembek, N. Goel, M. Hannemann, P. Motlicek, Y. Qian, P. Schwarz et al. "The kaldi speech recognition toolkit." In IEEE 2011 workshop on automatic speech recognition and understanding, no. EPFL-CONF-192584. IEEE Signal Processing Society, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details about the datasets are captured accurately, including their full citations.
