To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BitPruning: Learning Bitlengths for Aggressive and Accurate Quantization" by Miloš Nikolić et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method on **ImageNet** and **CIFAR10**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to gather more details about how these datasets were utilized. In the **Evaluation and Results** section, the authors provide specific information about the performance of their method on **CIFAR10** and **ImageNet**. They mention that they report experimental results for AlexNet and ResNet18 on CIFAR10, and also provide results for the same networks on ImageNet.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. arXiv:1409.0575, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CIFAR10**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on AlexNet and ResNet18.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

2. **ImageNet**: Another dataset used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method on AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNet V2.
   - Citation: Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. arXiv:1409.0575, 2014.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations for further use or analysis.
