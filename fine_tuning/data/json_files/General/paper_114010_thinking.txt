To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalized & Robust Framework For Timestamp Supervision in Temporal Action Segmentation" by Rahul Rahaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method produces state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they show results on standard cross-validation splits of three datasets: **Breakfast**, **50Salads**, and **GTEA**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather more details about each dataset. The paper provides some information about the datasets in the experiments section:

1. **Breakfast Dataset**: Contains 1,700 video clips with an average duration of 3.6 minutes per video and includes 48 action classes.

2. **50Salads Dataset**: Comprises 50 video clips with an average duration of 6.4 minutes per video and includes 19 action classes.

3. **GTEA Dataset**: Contains 28 video clips with an average duration of 1.5 minutes per video and includes 11 action classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Breakfast Dataset**:

- For the **50Salads Dataset**:
  > Stein, S., & McKenna, S.J. (2013). *Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities*. In Proceedings of the 2013 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, pp. 729–738.

  > Fathi, A., Ren, X., & Rehg, J.M. (2011). *Learning to recognize objects in egocentric activities*. In CVPR 2011, pp. 3281–3288.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
