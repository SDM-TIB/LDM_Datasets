To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Efficient Market Hypothesis for Bitcoin in the Context of Neural Networks" by Mike Kraehenbuehl and Joerg Osterrieder, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses various asset-related input features, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Summary Statistics)**, where the authors describe the features used in their experiments. They mention that the daily prices of selected features are imported from Yahoo Finance, starting from September 17, 2014, to April 30, 2022. This section is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets used for the analysis.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the selected input features along with their sources:

1. **BTC/USD**: Source - CoinMarketCap
2. **S&P 500**: Source - Standard & Poors
3. **Russell 2000**: Source - FTSE Russell
4. **EUR/USD**: Source - ICE Data Services
5. **10Y Treasury Note Yield**: Source - CBOE
6. **PHLX Gold&Silver Index**: Source - NASDAQ

I will note down these datasets and their sources, as they are essential for proper citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are sourced from well-known financial indices and platforms, I will provide the citations based on the information given in the paper:

- For **BTC/USD**, the citation is:
  > CoinMarketCap. Market Open and Close Times. [Online]. Available: https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016193231-Market-Open-and-Close-Times. Accessed: 2022-05-24.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
