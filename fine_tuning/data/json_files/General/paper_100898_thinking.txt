To extract datasets from the research paper titled "You made me feel this way: Investigating Partners’ Influence in Predicting Emotions in Couples’ Conflict Interactions using Speech Data" by George Boateng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions that data was collected from **368 German-speaking Swiss couples** during conflict interactions. This indicates that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Collection and Preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of **368 couples (N=736 participants)** who were videotaped during an **8-minute conflict interaction**. This section also outlines the inclusion criteria and the nature of the data collected, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, the authors also describe how self-reported emotional responses were collected after the interactions, which adds another layer of detail about the dataset. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference their own work regarding the data collection, which is important for proper citation. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset used in this study, the citation is:
  > Boateng, G., Hilpert, P., Bodenmann, G., Neysari, M., & Kowatsch, T. (2020). Speech Emotion Recognition among Couples using the Peak-End Rule and Transfer Learning. In Companion Publication of the 2020 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI ’20 Companion), October 25–29, 2020, Virtual event, Netherlands.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **Couples Conflict Interaction Dataset**: This dataset includes recordings from **368 German-speaking Swiss couples** during an **8-minute conflict interaction**. Each participant provided self-reported emotional responses post-interaction, focusing on emotional valence.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary details about the dataset while adhering to citation standards.
