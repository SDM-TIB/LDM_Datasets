To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing Activation Recomputation in Large Transformer Models" by Vijay Korthikanti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may also provide insights into the datasets' relevance to their research.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** for any additional context about the datasets. Sometimes, authors will discuss the implications of their findings in relation to specific datasets, which can provide further details.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "GPT-3" or "MT-NLG," I will look for the original papers that introduced these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
