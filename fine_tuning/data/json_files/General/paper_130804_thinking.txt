To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Analysis for Resource Constrained Decentralized Federated Learning Over Wireless Networks" by Zhigang Yan and Dong Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted numerical simulations using **fashion-MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are relevant for the analysis presented in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) on the **fashion-MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. This confirms that these datasets were used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The fashion-MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically attributed to the original authors. The CIFAR-10 dataset is also widely recognized, and I will look for its citation as well.

The full citations I found are:

- For **fashion-MNIST**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, divided into 10 categories. Each image is 28x28 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. Each image is 32x32 pixels.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented.
