To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-tune the Entire RAG Architecture (including DPR retriever) for Question-Answering" by Shamane Siriwardhana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but it does refer to the RAG architecture and its application to question answering, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the use of a "set of support documents from an external knowledge base." However, they do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **results section** to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of their experiments.

In the **results section**, the authors specifically mention using the **SQuAD dataset** to create a knowledge base for their experiments. They describe how they chunked the context passages into smaller segments, creating around 20,000 passages from the SQuAD dataset. This is a clear indication that the SQuAD dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, et al. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:453â€“466, 2019.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the SQuAD dataset.

Finally, I will prepare an entry for the SQuAD dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
