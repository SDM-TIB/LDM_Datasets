To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing putative bias in prediction of anti-microbial resistance from real-world genotyping data under explicit causal assumptions" by Mattia Prosperi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses genotype-phenotype AMR data from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC), which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **2.3 Data and experimental settings**. Here, the authors explicitly mention extracting genotype-phenotype AMR data and metadata from the PATRIC repository. They specify that they are using data related to the tetracycline class of antibiotics, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide detailed sampling characteristics of the PATRIC genotypes with known tetracycline antibiogram results, which includes the number of instances, countries, years, and species involved. This table confirms the dataset's composition and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the PATRIC dataset. The authors reference the PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center in their paper, which is essential for proper citation. The citation is as follows:
> James J. Davis, Alice R. Wattam, Ramy K. Aziz, Thomas Brettin, Ralph Butler, Rory M. Butler, Philippe Chlenski, Neal Conrad, Allan Dickerman, Emily M. Dietrich, Joseph L. Gabbard, Svetlana Gerdes, Andrew Guard, Ronald W. Kenyon, Dustin Machi, Chunhong Mao, Dan Murphy-Olson, Marcus Nguyen, Eric K. Nordberg, Gary J. Olsen, Robert D. Olson, Jamie C. Overbeek, Ross Overbeek, Bruce Parrello, Gordon D. Pusch, Maulik Shukla, Chris Thomas, Margo VanOeffelen, Veronika Vonstein, Andrew S. Warren, Fangfang Xia, Dawen Xie, Hyunseung Yoo, and Rick Stevens. 2019. The PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center: expanding data and analysis capabilities. *Nucleic Acids Research* 48, D1 (10 2019), D606â€“D612.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the PATRIC dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.
