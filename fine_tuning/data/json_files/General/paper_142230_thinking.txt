To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pretraining Billion-scale Geospatial Foundational Models on Frontier" by Aristeidis Tsaris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of publicly available data for pretraining, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **section titled "Downstream Evaluation as Model Scales"** where the authors summarize the datasets used for pretraining and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **MillionAID Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the largest publicly available geospatial databases, containing over 1 million non-overlapping remote sensing images spanning across 51 classes. The authors used 990,848 images for pretraining and selected 10,000 images for downstream evaluation.

2. **UC Merced Land Use (UCM)**: This dataset is referenced for image classification tasks, containing 21 classes. The authors used 1,000 training samples and 9,000 testing samples.

3. **Aerial Image Dataset (AID)**: This dataset is also used for image classification, consisting of 30 classes. The authors utilized 2,000 training samples and 8,000 testing samples.

4. **NWPU-RESISC45**: This dataset, collected by the Northwestern Polytechnical University, contains 45 classes. The authors used 3,150 training samples and 28,350 testing samples.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
