To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KnowSR: Knowledge Sharing among Homogeneous Agents in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning" by Zijian Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the other sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the need for knowledge sharing, but they do not mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically described. The authors mention conducting experiments in a **multi-agent particle environment (MPE)**, which is a simulation environment for testing MARL algorithms. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name; instead, they describe the environment used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily include foundational papers and algorithms related to reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems, but they do not specifically cite any datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will note that the primary experimental setup relies on the **multi-agent particle environment (MPE)**, which is a well-known simulation framework in the field of MARL. However, it is important to clarify that MPE itself is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a simulation environment used for testing algorithms.

To summarize, I will document the following:

1. **Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)**: This is the primary environment used for experiments in the paper. While it is not a dataset in the conventional sense, it serves as the basis for the empirical validation of the proposed method.

Since there are no formal datasets cited in the paper, I will ensure to mention that the authors utilized the MPE for their experiments, and I will provide a reference to the original paper describing the MPE for completeness.

The citation for the MPE is:
> Lowe, R., Wu, Y., Tamar, A., Harb, J., Abbeel, P., & Mordatch, I. (2017). Multi-agent actor-critic for mixed cooperative-competitive environments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1706.02275.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
