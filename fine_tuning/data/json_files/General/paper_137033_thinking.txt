To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SVFAP: Self-supervised Video Facial Affect Perceiver" by Licai Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **nine datasets spanning three downstream tasks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention six datasets for dynamic facial expression recognition:

1. **DFEW**: This dataset consists of 16,372 video clips extracted from over 1,500 high-definition movies, annotated with seven basic emotions. The citation for DFEW is:
   > Y. Wang et al., "DFEW: A large-scale database for recognizing dynamic facial expressions in the wild," in Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2020, pp. 2881–2889.

2. **MAFW**: A multimodal compound affective dataset containing 10,045 video clips annotated with 11 compound emotions. The citation for MAFW is:
   > Y. Liu et al., "MAFW: A large-scale, multi-modal, compound affective database for dynamic facial expression recognition in the wild," in Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2022, pp. 24–32.

3. **FERV39k**: The largest real-world dynamic facial expression recognition dataset with 38,935 video clips. The citation for FERV39k is:
   > Y. Wang et al., "FERV39k: A large-scale multi-scene dataset for facial expression recognition in videos," in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022, pp. 20 922–20 931.

4. **CREMA-D**: A high-quality audio-visual dataset consisting of 7,442 video clips from 91 actors, each labeled with six emotions. The citation for CREMA-D is:
   > M. Mansoorizadeh et al., "CREMA-D: Crowd-sourced emotional multimodal actors dataset," IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 5, no. 4, pp. 377–390, 2014.

5. **RAVDESS**: An audio-visual dataset of emotional speech and song with 2,880 video clips from 24 actors, labeled with eight emotions. The citation for RAVDESS is:
   > S. R. Livingstone and F. A. Russo, "The Ryerson audio-visual database of emotional speech and song (RAVDESS): A dynamic, multimodal set of facial and vocal expressions in North American English," PloS One, vol. 13, no. 5, p. e0196391, 2018.

6. **eNTERFACE05**: An audio-visual emotion dataset containing about 1,200 video clips from over 40 subjects, each simulating six emotions. The citation for eNTERFACE05 is:
   > O. Martin et al., "The eNTERFACE'05 audio-visual emotion database," in 22nd International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops (ICDEW'06), IEEE, 2006, pp. 8–8.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** of the paper to confirm the full citations for each dataset, as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use or analysis.
