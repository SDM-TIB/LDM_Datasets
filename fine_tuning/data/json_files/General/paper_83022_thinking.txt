To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Semantic Segmentation of Anatomical Structure and Pathologies in Colour Fundus Images Associated with Diabetic Retinopathy" by Oindrila Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the study but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of automated segmentation for diabetic retinopathy but do not mention specific datasets. Moving to the **methodology**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training and evaluation.

In **section 2.2 (Training)**, the authors mention using the **Drishti-GS dataset** for data augmentation. They describe how images from this dataset were resized and used to create segmentation masks for the optic disk. This indicates that the Drishti-GS dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Additionally, in **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they used the **IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset)** for their segmentation and grading challenge. They clarify that this dataset provides optic disk segmentation masks for images with apparent retinopathy.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Drishti-GS dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Sivaswamy, S. R. Krishnadas, G. Datt Joshi, M. Jain, and A. U. Syed Tabish. "Drishti-GS: Retinal image dataset for optic nerve head (ONH) segmentation." In Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE 11th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), pages 53–56, April 2014.

2. For the **IDRiD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Gulshan V, Peng L, Coram M, et al. "Development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs." JAMA, vol. 316, no. 22, pp. 2402–2410, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, which is essential for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
