To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Survey on Visual Signal Coding and Processing with Generative Models: Technologies, Standards and Optimization" by Zhibo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain dataset information, such as the **experiments, results, and references**.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section often details the datasets used for training or evaluation. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific applications.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. This is crucial because datasets often have associated papers that provide comprehensive details about their creation and usage. I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

If the paper discusses any **standardization activities** or **quality assessment datasets**, I will pay particular attention to those as they may be significant in the context of the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section. This will provide a complete and accurate account of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, purpose, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
