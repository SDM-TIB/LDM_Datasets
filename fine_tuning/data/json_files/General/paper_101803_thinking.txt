To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Mediated Teleoperation with a Hand-Arm Exoskeleton in Long Time Delays Using Reinforcement Learning" by Hadi Beik-Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors describe any experiments involving specific datasets, I will note those down.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **simulated environment** for their experiments, which suggests that they may not reference traditional datasets but rather a custom simulation setup. I will look for any references to the simulation environment or any datasets that might have been used to train the models or validate the results.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation format as presented in the references.

If the paper does not provide explicit datasets but rather describes a simulation framework, I will note that down as well, indicating that the data was generated through simulation rather than sourced from a traditional dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset or simulation framework is clearly described, along with its full citation, if applicable. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
