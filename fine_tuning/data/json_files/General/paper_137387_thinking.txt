To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A new computationally efficient algorithm to solve Feature Selection for Functional Data Classification in high-dimensional spaces" by Tobia Boschi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and mentions a real data application analyzing relationships between chronic diseases and health factors, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or studies. They mention the use of the SHARE dataset in the context of their real data application, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

In **section 4 (SHARE application)**, the authors provide detailed information about the SHARE dataset. They specify that they analyze a subset of 36 variables from the EasySHARE dataset, which is a preprocessed version of the SHARE data. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SHARE dataset. The authors cite the SHARE project as follows:
> Alcser, K. H., et al. The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe: Methodology. Mannheim Research Institute for the Economics of Aging (MEA), 2005.

Additionally, they reference the EasySHARE dataset:
> Gruber, S., Hunkler, C., and Stuck, S. Generating easyshare: guidelines, structure, content and programming. Technical report, SHARE Working Paper Series 17-2014. Munich, 2014.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **SHARE Dataset**: This dataset is a longitudinal study that investigates the effects of health, social, economic, and environmental policies on the life course of European citizens. The authors specifically analyze a subset of 36 variables from the EasySHARE dataset.

2. **EasySHARE Dataset**: A preprocessed version of the SHARE data, which includes various health and socio-demographic factors relevant to the study.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have the full citations for both datasets ready for inclusion in the final output. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
