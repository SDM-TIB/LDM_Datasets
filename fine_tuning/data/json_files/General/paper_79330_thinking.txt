To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Switching Networks" by Chuan-Yung Tsai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used for comparison or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using **three datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN2** for their experiments. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, such as for training and validation purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for a **dedicated section** that discusses the datasets in detail, which may include descriptions of their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken. In this case, the authors mention that they reserve the last 5,000 training images for validation and zero-pad MNIST images to ensure uniform spatial resolution across datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **SVHN Dataset**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011. Available: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/

With the datasets identified and their citations retrieved, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations for future use or verification.
