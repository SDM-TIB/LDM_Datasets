To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Neural Networks as Point Estimates for Deep Gaussian Processes" by Vincent Dutordoir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "experimental results on regression and classification datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but does not specify their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that they conducted experiments on various regression problems and large-scale image classification tasks. 

I will look for specific dataset names and details in the subsections of Section 5. For instance, in **subsection 5.2 (Regression on UCI benchmarks)**, the authors list several datasets used for regression tasks, including:

1. **Yacht Dataset**: A dataset with 308 instances and 6 features.
2. **Energy Dataset**: A dataset with 768 instances and 8 features.
3. **Concrete Dataset**: A dataset with 1030 instances and 8 features.
4. **Wine Red Dataset**: A dataset with 1599 instances and 11 features.
5. **Wine White Dataset**: A dataset with 4898 instances and 11 features.
6. **Kin8mn Dataset**: A dataset with 8192 instances and 8 features.
7. **Power Dataset**: A dataset with 9568 instances and 4 features.

In **subsection 5.3 (Large scale image classification)**, the authors mention using the **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their image classification experiments. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may not always provide specific dataset citations, but I can look for foundational papers or sources that describe these datasets:

- For the **UCI datasets**, I can refer to:
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). UCI Machine Learning Repository. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. (1998). MNIST handwritten digit database. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

- For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., and Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
