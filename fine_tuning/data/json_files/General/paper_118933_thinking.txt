To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Generative Models for Bankruptcy Prediction Using Textual Data" by Rogelio A. Mancisidor and Kjersti Aas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves using textual data from financial filings, specifically the Management’s Discussion & Analysis (MDA) section in Form 10-K, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of traditional bankruptcy prediction models that rely on complete data, hinting at the need for datasets that include both accounting and textual data. The introduction also references previous works that have utilized MDA data, which may lead to identifying specific datasets.

In the **data section**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their research. They mention that the data includes accounting, market, and MDA data for publicly traded firms on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX stock exchanges from 1994 to 2020. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the datasets.

The paper states that the accounting and market data are extracted from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), specifically from Compustat Fundamentals and CRSP. The MDA section is extracted from the Form 10-K available through the SEC's EDGAR system. This information is essential for citing the datasets accurately.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Accounting and Market Data**: 
   - Source: Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), Compustat Fundamentals and CRSP.
   - Citation:
     > Wharton Research Data Services. *Compustat Fundamentals*. Available at: [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/).
     > Wharton Research Data Services. *Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)*. Available at: [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/).

2. **MDA Data**:
   - Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), EDGAR system.
   - Citation:
     > U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. *EDGAR Database*. Available at: [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html).

3. **Bankruptcy Data**:
   - The authors mention that their bankruptcy data is an updated version of the data used in Chava (2014).
   - Citation:
     > Chava, S. (2014). *Environmental externalities and cost of capital*. Management Science, 60(9):2223–2247.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help in systematically identifying and documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
