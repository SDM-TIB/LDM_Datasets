To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Semantic Segmentation Masks with Embeddings for Fine-Grained Form Classification" by Taylor Archibald and Tony Martinez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors contribute two novel datasets, which is a strong indication that I will find specific details about them.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they created for their research. They mention two datasets:

1. **U.S. 1950 Census Dataset**: This dataset consists of completed census forms from the U.S. 1950 census, comprising 441 labeled images distributed across 5 form types. The authors also mention that for self-supervised training, they used 9,191 U.S. 1950 Census forms.

2. **19th-Century French Census Dataset**: This dataset contains completed census forms from 19th century France, with 591 labeled images distributed across 14 form types. For self-supervised training, they used 2,600 instances of similar form types.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are novel contributions by the authors, they may not have formal citations in the traditional sense. Instead, I will note that the datasets are available for use as indicated in the paper.

The authors mention that the census datasets are available at a specific GitHub repository: https://github.com/tahlor/census_forms. This is important information to include when describing the datasets.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and the link to access them.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
