To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection" by Sihao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of BERT4ETH on two crucial fraud detection tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors provide statistics for the datasets used in their experiments, specifically for phishing account detection and de-anonymization tasks. 

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Phishing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,057 accounts labeled by Etherscan, with 97% being Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). The dataset statistics include:
   - Number of EOAs: 3,220
   - Total addresses: 151,415
   - Total transactions: 328,261
   - In transactions: 182,356
   - Out transactions: 145,905

2. **ENS Dataset**: This dataset is used for the de-anonymization task and consists of ground-truth pairs collected from the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The statistics for this dataset are:
   - Number of pairs: 288

3. **Tornado Dataset**: This dataset is also used for the de-anonymization task and consists of ground-truth pairs collected from Tornado Cash. The statistics for this dataset are:
   - Number of pairs: 182

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are primarily derived from the authors' own collection and do not have separate citations in the references.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Sihao Hu, Zhen Zhang, Bingqiao Luo, Shengliang Lu, Bingsheng He, and Ling Liu. 2023. BERT4ETH: A Pre-trained Transformer for Ethereum Fraud Detection. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2023 (WWW â€™23), April 30-May 4, 2023, Austin, TX, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3543507.3583345

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
