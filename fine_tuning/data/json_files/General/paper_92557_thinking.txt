To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamically Mitigating Data Discrepancy with Balanced Focal Loss for Replay Attack Detection" by Yongqiang Dou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ASVspoof2019 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial to their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention using the **ASVspoof2019 simulated PA dataset**, which is divided into three subsets: the training set (PA train set), the development set (PA dev set), and the evaluation set (PA eval set). They also mention the **Real-PA dataset**, which was created with real replay operations.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **ASVspoof2019 Simulated PA Dataset**: This dataset is an improved version with controlled environments and acoustic configurations. It consists of three subsets:
   - **PA train set**: Contains 5,400 bona fide utterances and 48,600 spoofed utterances.
   - **PA dev set**: Contains 5,400 bona fide utterances and 24,300 spoofed utterances.
   - **PA eval set**: Contains 18,090 bona fide utterances and 116,640 spoofed utterances.

2. **Real-PA Dataset**: This dataset was made with real replay operations from three different labs and contains 540 bona fide utterances and 2,160 spoofed utterances.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the ASVspoof2019 Challenge, which provides the necessary citation for the dataset:

- For the **ASVspoof2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Yamagishi, M. Todisco, M. Sahidullah, H. Delgado, X. Wang, N. Evans, T. Kinnunen, K. A. Lee, V. Vestman, and A. Nautsch. *Asvspoof 2019: The 3rd automatic speaker verification spooofing and countermeasures challenge database*. Asvspoof2019 evaluation plan.pdf. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.7488/ds/2555

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
