To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Pre-training and Local Re-training: Transferable Representation Learning on Multi-source Knowledge Graphs" by Zequn Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention key datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context and motivation for their work. This section often contains references to datasets that are foundational to the research.

I will then examine the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the experimental setup and results. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific configurations or splits.

In the paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **FB15K-237**: A widely used benchmark dataset for link prediction in knowledge graphs.
2. **WN18RR**: Another benchmark dataset for knowledge graph completion tasks.
3. **YAGO3-10**: A large-scale knowledge graph used for various tasks, including link prediction.
4. **DBP15K**: A dataset for cross-lingual entity alignment, which includes multiple language versions of DBpedia.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
