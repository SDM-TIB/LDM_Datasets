To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Machine Learning Algorithms for Credit Scoring" by Przemysław Biecek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the research utilizes a "large dataset obtained from the Polish Credit Bureau," which suggests that this dataset is central to the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology and experimental results sections**. In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset: it consists of over 5 million observations for lending companies’ clients, with 1,729 variables, covering the time span from October 1, 2017, to May 30, 2019. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and context.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure that I have captured all relevant citations. The dataset is attributed to the Polish Credit Bureau, which is a significant source for credit data in Poland. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it is a proprietary dataset used in the study.

Since the dataset is derived from the Polish Credit Bureau, I will note that the citation for the dataset can be referenced as follows:

- **Polish Credit Bureau Dataset**: The dataset is derived from the Polish Credit Bureau, which collects credit information from banks and lending companies in Poland. The specific citation for the dataset is not provided in the paper, but it can be referenced as:
  > Polish Credit Bureau S.A. (Biuro Informacji Kredytowej S.A.). *Credit data for lending companies in Poland*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as described above. This will ensure that the information is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
