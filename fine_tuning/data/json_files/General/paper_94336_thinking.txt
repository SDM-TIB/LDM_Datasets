To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-LXMERT: Paint, Caption and Answer Questions with Multi-Modal Transformers" by Jaemin Cho et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors introduce X-LXMERT and discuss its capabilities, which may hint at the datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Related Works and Background sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field of vision-and-language tasks. This could provide context for the datasets they might have used.

In **section 3 (Background)**, the authors mention that LXMERT is pretrained on several vision-and-language datasets, specifically noting that they use datasets whose images come from **MS COCO** and **Visual Genome**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Moving to **section 6 (Experimental Setup)**, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, the authors state that they use the **MS COCO** dataset for image generation tasks and also aggregate three large image question answering datasets: **VQA v2.0**, **GQA**, and **VG-QA**. This section confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MS COCO**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

2. **Visual Genome**:
   > Krishna, R., Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Johnson, J., Hata, K., Kravitz, J., Chen, S., Kalantidis, Y., Li, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2016). *Visual Genome: Connecting Language and Vision Using Crowdsourced Dense Image Annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision.

3. **VQA v2.0**:
   > Goyal, Y., Khot, T., Agrawal, A., Summers-Stay, D., Batra, D., & Parikh, D. (2019). *Making the V in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in Visual Question Answering*. International Journal of Computer Vision.

4. **GQA**:
   > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). *GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering*. In CVPR.

5. **VG-QA**:
   > Zhu, Y., Groth, O., Bernstein, M., & Fei-Fei, L. (2016). *Visual7W: Grounded Question Answering in Images*. In CVPR.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented for any further processing or review.
