To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic-aligned Fusion Transformer for One-shot Object Detection" by Yizhou Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to look for any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed information about the datasets. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation, including any specific splits or configurations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, such as "PASCAL-VOC" or "MS-COCO," which are common in object detection research.

In section 4.1, the authors mention that they follow previous work to train and evaluate their model on **PASCAL-VOC** and **MS-COCO** datasets. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of classes or specific splits used for training and testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets. 

For the **PASCAL-VOC dataset**, I will find the citation:
> Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

For the **MS-COCO dataset**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future use or analysis.
