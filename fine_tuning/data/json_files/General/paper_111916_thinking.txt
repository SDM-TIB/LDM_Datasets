To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of loss function in Deep Learning methods for accurate retinal vessel segmentation" by Daniela Herrera et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **DRIVE dataset** for evaluating different deep learning architectures and loss functions. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present and relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Data and methods)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used in their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE)** dataset, which contains 40 images, including 7 abnormal pathology cases. They also note that they used a version with data augmentation, increasing the number of training images from 20 to 256.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the DRIVE dataset is as follows:
> Staal, J., Abramoff, M., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M., & van Ginneken, B. (2004). Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina. *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 23(4), 501â€“509. https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2004.825627

Since the paper primarily discusses the DRIVE dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction. I will summarize the key details about the dataset, including its purpose, the number of images, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for downstream processing, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any required format or structure.
