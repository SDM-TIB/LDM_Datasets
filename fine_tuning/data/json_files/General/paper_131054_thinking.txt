To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced Visual Instruction Tuning with Synthesized Image-Dialogue Data" by Yanda Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract mentions a novel data collection methodology that synthesizes images and dialogues for visual instruction tuning, indicating that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and the need for paired vision-text data, which suggests that they may have created or utilized specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where they describe their data generation pipeline. Here, they mention generating a dataset with approximately **126K image-dialogue pairs** and an additional dataset of **3K multi-image instances**. This indicates that they synthesized their own datasets rather than relying solely on existing ones.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail the training datasets used, confirming that they generated a diverse dataset covering various single-image abilities and multi-image instances. They also mention the use of the **LLaVA dataset** as a foundational dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper references the **LLaVA model** and other datasets like **COCO**, **VisWiz**, **MM-Vet**, **GQA**, and **MMBench**. I will extract the relevant citations for these datasets:

1. **LLaVA Dataset**:
   > Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Qingyang Wu, and Yong Jae Lee. *Visual instruction tuning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.08485, 2023.

2. **COCO Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized and synthesized in the research paper.
