To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Precision in Tactile Internet-Enabled Remote Robotic Surgery: Kalman Filter Approach" by Muhammad Hanif Lashari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **JIGSAWS dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset and Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **JIGSAWS dataset**. They describe it as a comprehensive surgical skill dataset developed by the Computational Interaction and Robotics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. The dataset includes kinematic, video, and gesture data from three surgical tasks performed using the da Vinci surgical robot: suturing, knot tying, and needle passing. This section provides a thorough description of the dataset's composition and its significance in the study.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the JIGSAWS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Lefor, A. K., Harada, K., Dosis, A., & Mitsuishi, M. (2020). Motion analysis of the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set using robotics video and motion assessment software. *International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery*, 15, 2017â€“2025.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the JIGSAWS dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its purpose and the context in which it was used.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required.
