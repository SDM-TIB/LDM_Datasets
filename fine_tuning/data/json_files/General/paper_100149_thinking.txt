To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SS-CADA: A Semi-Supervised Cross-Anatomy Domain Adaptation for Coronary Artery Segmentation" by Jingyang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the segmentation of coronary arteries and the use of publicly available labeled fundus images (FIs), which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several publicly available annotated FI datasets, specifically naming **DRIVE**, **STARE**, and **RITE**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. They mention using the **DRIVE dataset** as the source domain for retinal vessels, which contains 40 fundus images. Additionally, they describe the collection of **191 X-ray angiograms (XAs)** from 30 patients, with 20 of these being annotated by an expert radiologist. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will gather full citations for these datasets from the **references section**:

1. For the **DRIVE dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Staal, M. D. Abramoff, M. Niemeijer, M. A. Viergever, and B. V. Ginneken. "Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, vol. 23, no. 4, pp. 501–509, 2004.

2. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the **STARE** and **RITE** datasets, so I will note that they are mentioned but not cited in detail. However, I can include general references for these datasets based on common knowledge in the field:
   - **STARE dataset**: A. Hoover and M. Goldbaum. "Locating the optic nerve in a retinal image using the fuzzy convergence of the blood vessels." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, vol. 22, no. 8, pp. 951–958, 2003.
   - **RITE dataset**: Q. Hu, M. D. Abramoff, and M. K. Garvin. "Automated separation of binary overlapping trees in low-contrast color retinal images." In *MICCAI*, 2013, pp. 436–443.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
