To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Human pose estimation via Convolutional Part Heatmap Regression" by Adrian Bulat and Georgios Tzimiropoulos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieve top performance on the **MPII** and **LSP** datasets, which suggests these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of these datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. In the results section, the authors provide a comparison of their method's performance on both the **MPII** and **LSP** datasets, confirming their usage.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding of the datasets' origins.

1. For the **MPII dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andriluka, M., Pishchulin, L., Gehler, P., & Schiele, B. (2014). *2D human pose estimation: New benchmark and state of the art analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

2. For the **LSP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Johnson, S., & Everingham, M. (2010). *Clustered pose and nonlinear appearance models for human pose estimation*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MPII Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for 2D human pose estimation, widely used for evaluating pose estimation algorithms.
- **LSP Dataset**: A dataset that provides annotated images for human pose estimation, also commonly used in the field.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
