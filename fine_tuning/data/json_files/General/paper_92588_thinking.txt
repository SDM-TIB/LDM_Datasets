To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Class-Similarity Based Label Smoothing for Confidence Calibration" by Chihuang Liu and Joseph JaJa, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of confidence calibration in deep neural networks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section (Section 6)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny-ImageNet**. This indicates that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for more details about these datasets in the paper. The authors do not provide extensive descriptions of the datasets within the text, but I can infer their significance based on common knowledge in the field. 

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet are well-known datasets, I can provide their standard citations based on existing literature:

1. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **Tiny-ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Tiny ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
