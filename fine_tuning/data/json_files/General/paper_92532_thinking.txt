To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepAbstract: Neural Network Abstraction for Accelerating Verification" by Pranav Ashok et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of verifying neural networks and the need for reliable datasets in safety-critical applications. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) to identify any datasets used for training or testing the neural networks. The authors mention that they ran experiments on the **MNIST dataset**. This is a well-known dataset used for handwritten digit recognition, and it is crucial to document it properly.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun. "The MNIST database of handwritten digits." 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The only dataset extracted from this paper is the MNIST dataset, and I will ensure to include its full citation in the final output. 

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it includes the necessary details and citation.
