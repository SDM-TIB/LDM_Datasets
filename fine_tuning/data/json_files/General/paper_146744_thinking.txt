To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AoA-Based Physical Layer Authentication in Analog Arrays under Impersonation Attacks" by Muralikrishnan Srinivasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of angle of arrival (AoA) for authentication, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors focus on the performance of their proposed authentication protocol under various attack scenarios, but they do not seem to reference any specific datasets directly.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of other authors. The references primarily consist of papers discussing physical layer authentication and related topics, but they do not appear to include specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or testing, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. However, I will note that the authors discuss various attack models and performance metrics related to their proposed method, which could be relevant for future research or dataset creation.

In summary, after thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will document that no specific datasets were identified or cited in the research paper. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to extract their names and provide full citations as needed.
