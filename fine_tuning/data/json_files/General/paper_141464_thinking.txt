To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GINopic: Topic Modeling with Graph Isomorphism Network" by Suman Adhya and Debarshi Kumar Sanyal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on "diverse benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they list five datasets:

1. **20NewsGroups (20NG)**: This dataset consists of 16,309 pre-processed documents from 20 different newsgroups, with each document labeled by its corresponding category type.

2. **BBC News (BBC)**: This dataset includes 2,225 news articles from BBC, categorized into five classes: tech, business, entertainment, sports, and politics.

3. **SearchSnippets (SS)**: Derived from predefined phrases across eight domains, this dataset is constructed from web search transactions.

4. **Biomedicine (Bio)**: This dataset utilizes challenge data from BioASQ’s official website.

5. **StackOverflow (SO)**: This dataset contains 20,000 question titles randomly selected from 20 different tags on StackOverflow.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **Appendix A** section, which provides additional descriptions and confirms the information provided in section 4.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **20NewsGroups (20NG)**, the citation is:
  > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2006). Practical solutions to the problem of diagonal dominance in kernel document clustering. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 377–384. Association for Computing Machinery.

- For **BBC News (BBC)**, the citation is:
  > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2006). Practical solutions to the problem of diagonal dominance in kernel document clustering. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), pages 377–384. Association for Computing Machinery.

- For **SearchSnippets (SS)**, the citation is:
  > Qiang, J., Qian, Z., Li, Y., Yuan, Y., & Wu, X. (2022). Short text topic modeling techniques, applications, and performance: A survey. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge & Data Engineering, 34(03), 1427–1445.

- For **Biomedicine (Bio)**, the citation is:
  > Qiang, J., Qian, Z., Li, Y., Yuan, Y., & Wu, X. (2022). Short text topic modeling techniques, applications, and performance: A survey. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge & Data Engineering, 34(03), 1427–1445.

- For **StackOverflow (SO)**, the citation is:
  > Qiang, J., Qian, Z., Li, Y., Yuan, Y., & Wu, X. (2022). Short text topic modeling techniques, applications, and performance: A survey. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge & Data Engineering, 34(03), 1427–1445.

With all this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or processing.
