To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Pseudo-Encoded Stochastic Variational Inference" by Amir Zadeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the **experiments section** is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list the datasets utilized in their experiments. I will carefully note each dataset's name, description, and any relevant details provided by the authors. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset is generated with specific distributional properties, containing 50,000 datapoints with a ground-truth dimension of 300. The authors describe the generation process, which involves combining independent dimensions sampled from various distributions.

2. **CMU-MOSI Dataset**: This dataset is focused on multimodal sentiment analysis and contains 2,199 video segments from 93 YouTube movie review videos. The authors provide details about the training, validation, and test splits, which are essential for understanding how the dataset is structured.

3. **300-W Dataset**: This is a meta-dataset of facial landmark datasets, including annotations from various sources. The authors mention using specific partitions of the dataset for their experiments.

4. **SST (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: This dataset consists of movie review excerpts annotated for sentiment analysis. The authors specify that they only use the root nodes for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and should be formatted correctly. Based on the information provided in the paper, I will compile the citations as follows:

- For **Synthetic Data**, since it is generated data, it may not have a formal citation but should be described in the context of the paper.

- For **CMU-MOSI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zadeh, A., Zellers, R., Pincus, E., & Morency, L.-P. (2016). Multimodal sentiment intensity analysis in videos: Facial gestures and verbal messages. *IEEE Intelligent Systems*, 31(6), 82-88.

- For **300-W Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, X., & Ramanan, D. (2012). Face detection, pose estimation, and landmark localization in the wild. In *Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 2012 IEEE Conference on (pp. 2879-2886). IEEE.

- For **SST**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. In *Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing* (pp. 1631-1642).

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
