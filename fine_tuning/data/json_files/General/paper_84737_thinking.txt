To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dense Deformation Network for High Resolution Tissue-Cleared Image Registration" by Abdullah Nazib et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data from a tissue-clearing method named **CUBIC**, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods section**, particularly in the **Training Data Generation** subsection. Here, the authors mention that they used **tissue-cleared images of the Arc-dVenus mouse brain** for training and testing. They specify that they have **20 brains for training and 3 brains for testing** at two different resolutions (10% and 25%).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CUBIC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CUBIC**:

Ueda. *Whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution using chemical cocktails and computational analysis*. Cell, vol. 157, no. 3, pp. 726â€“739, April 2014.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **CUBIC Dataset**: This dataset consists of tissue-cleared images of the Arc-dVenus mouse brain, used for training and testing the proposed Dense Deformation Network. The authors utilized images at two resolutions: 10% and 25%, with 20 brains for training and 3 for testing.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the paper.
