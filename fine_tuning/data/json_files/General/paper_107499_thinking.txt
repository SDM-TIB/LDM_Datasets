To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Information Assisted Attention-Free Decoder for Audio Captioning" by Feiyang Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **DCASE 2021 Challenge**, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **Clotho-v2**: This dataset is described as being released for Task 6 of the DCASE 2021 Challenge, containing 3839 audio clips for development, 1045 for validation, and 1045 for evaluation. Each audio clip has five captions, and the duration of the clips varies from 15 to 30 seconds.

2. **AudioCaps**: This dataset is mentioned as another AAC dataset, which includes audio signals from AudioSet. The paper states that it contains 44366 audio clips for development, 458 for validation, and 905 for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Clotho-v2**, the citation is:
  > K. Drossos, S. Lipping, T. Virtanen. *Clotho: An audio captioning dataset*. In Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech and Signal Process., Barcelona, Spain, 2020, pp. 736–740.

- For **AudioCaps**, the citation is:
  > C. D. Kim, B. Kim, H. Lee, G. Kim. *Audiocaps: Generating captions for audios in the wild*. In Proc. Conf. N. Am. Chapter Assoc. Comput. Linguistics: Hum. Lang. Technol., Minneapolis, MN, USA, 2019, pp. 119–132.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper referencing. This will allow for clear identification and acknowledgment of the datasets used in the research.
