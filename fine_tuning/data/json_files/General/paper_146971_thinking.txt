To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Global and Local Features of Power Load Series Through Transformer and 2D-CNN: An Image-Based Multi-Step Forecasting Approach Incorporating Phase Space Reconstruction" by Zihan Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **five real-world benchmark datasets** for power load forecasting, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **Elia-2022**: This dataset consists of power load data from 2022 for the interconnected power grid of Elia, the Belgian power system operator.

2. **City-1**: This dataset includes power load data from 2012 to 2014 for a distribution network in a city in southern China.

3. **Area-1**: This dataset contains power load data from 2009 to 2015 for a region in southern China.

4. **Area-2**: Similar to Area-1, this dataset also includes power load data from 2009 to 2015 for another region in southern China.

5. **Australia**: This dataset consists of residential power load data from 2013 for 300 customers aggregated in a community located in New South Wales, Australia.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets mentioned in this paper are likely not from external sources but rather collected by the authors or their institutions. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets with the information provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names and descriptions of each dataset along with their respective citations as follows:

- **Elia-2022**: Power load data from 2022 for the interconnected power grid of Elia, the Belgian power system operator.

- **City-1**: Power load data from 2012 to 2014 for a distribution network in a city in southern China.

- **Area-1**: Power load data from 2009 to 2015 for a region in southern China.

- **Area-2**: Power load data from 2009 to 2015 for another region in southern China.

- **Australia**: Residential power load data from 2013 for 300 customers aggregated in a community located in New South Wales, Australia.

Since these datasets are described in the paper without external citations, I will note that they are original datasets used by the authors for their experiments.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
