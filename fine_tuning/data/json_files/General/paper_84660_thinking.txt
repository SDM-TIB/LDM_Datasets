To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing the Structure of Attention in a Transformer Language Model" by Jesse Vig and Yonatan Belinkov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the analysis of attention in the GPT-2 model, but it does not mention specific datasets. I will need to look deeper into the methods section for any dataset descriptions.

In **section 5.2 (Experimental Setup)**, the authors mention that they focused their analysis on text from **English Wikipedia**, which they extracted 10,000 articles from and then sampled 100,000 sentences. This indicates that the dataset used for their analysis is derived from Wikipedia, which is a well-known and publicly available dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the dataset is a common source (Wikipedia), it may not have a specific citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is publicly available and widely used in NLP research.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Wikipedia Dataset**: The authors used a dataset derived from English Wikipedia, consisting of 10,000 articles and 100,000 sentences for their analysis of attention in the GPT-2 model.

Since the dataset is based on Wikipedia, I will provide a general citation for Wikipedia:

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://www.wikipedia.org/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily accessed or cited in future work.
