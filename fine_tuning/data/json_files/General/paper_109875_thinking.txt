To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Anchor-Free Universal Lesion Detection in CT-Scans" by Manu Sheoran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the **DeepLesion dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the DeepLesion dataset as a multi-organ CT-scan dataset containing approximately 32K lesions annotated across various organs. This confirms that the dataset is significant for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that all experiments are performed on the **DeepLesion dataset**, which consists of 32,735 lesions bounding-box instances on 32,120 axial key CT slices from 4,427 unique patients. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's scale and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DeepLesion dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ke Yan et al., “DeepLesion: automated mining of large-scale lesion annotations and universal lesion detection with deep learning,” J. Med. Imaging, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **DeepLesion Dataset**: A multi-organ CT-scan dataset with 32,735 lesions annotated across various organs, available publicly for benchmarking universal lesion detection techniques.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that the details are clear and ready for further processing or review.
