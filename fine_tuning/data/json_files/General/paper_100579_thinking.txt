To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Action Proposal Generation with Transformers" by Lining Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that extensive experiments were conducted on two popular benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **ActivityNet-v1.3**: This dataset is described as a large-scale video dataset for action recognition and temporal action detection tasks. It contains 10,000 training, 5,000 validation, and 5,000 testing videos across 200 action categories.

2. **THUMOS14**: This dataset is noted for its challenging nature, providing frame-wise action annotations. The authors mention using a subset of THUMOS14 that includes 200 untrimmed videos for training and 213 untrimmed videos for testing.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their method on both **ActivityNet-v1.3** and **THUMOS14**, reinforcing that these are the datasets they utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ActivityNet-v1.3**, the citation is:
  > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Activitynet: A large-scale video benchmark for human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961â€“970, 2015.

- For **THUMOS14**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Gang Jiang, Jingen Liu, A Roshan Zamir, George Toderici, Ivan Laptev, Mubarak Shah, and Rahul Sukthankar. *THUMOS challenge: Action recognition with a large number of classes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant details are captured effectively.
