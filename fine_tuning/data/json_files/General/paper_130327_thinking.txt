To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semisupervised Anomaly Detection using Support Vector Regression with Quantum Kernel" by Kilian Tscharke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the models are benchmarked on "10 real-world anomaly detection data sets and one toy data set," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** section. In this paper, the authors mention that they benchmark their model on "10 popular real-world anomaly detection data sets" and a "simple toy data set." I will need to find the specific names of these datasets.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide a brief overview of the datasets used. They mention the following datasets:

1. **Credit Card Fraud (CC) Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for fraud detection tasks.
2. **Census Dataset**: This dataset contains demographic information and is often used for classification tasks.
3. **CoverT Dataset**: This dataset is used for network intrusion detection.
4. **DoH Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting malicious traffic.
5. **EMNIST Dataset**: This dataset extends the MNIST dataset to include handwritten letters.
6. **FMNIST Dataset**: This dataset is a fashion product dataset used for benchmarking.
7. **KDD Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for network intrusion detection.
8. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
9. **Mammo Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting microcalcifications in mammography.
10. **Toy Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this study.
11. **URL Dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting malicious URLs.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. Here are the citations I found:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
