To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Controllable and Personalized Review Generation" by Pan Li and Alexander Tuzhilin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on several real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they implemented their model on three subsets of the Amazon Review Dataset, which is a clear indication of the datasets involved.

The paper specifies the following datasets:

1. **Musical Instrument Reviews**: A subset of the Amazon Review Dataset that includes reviews related to musical instruments.
2. **Automotive Reviews**: Another subset of the Amazon Review Dataset focused on automotive products.
3. **Patio Reviews**: A third subset of the Amazon Review Dataset that contains reviews for patio-related items.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Amazon Review Dataset. The relevant citations are:

- For the Amazon Review Dataset, the citation is:
  > Ruining He and Julian McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web, pages 507â€“517, 2016.

Since the authors used specific subsets of the Amazon Review Dataset, I will note that while the subsets are not individually cited, they are derived from the original dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Amazon Review Dataset, which serves as the authoritative source for the subsets mentioned in the paper. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any further use or analysis.
