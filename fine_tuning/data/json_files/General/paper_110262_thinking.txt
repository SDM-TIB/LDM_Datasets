To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Processes for Missing Value Imputation" by Bahram Jafrasteha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "one private clinical data set and four UCI datasets." This indicates that there are at least five datasets to look for.

Next, I will proceed to **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide a table (Table 1) that lists the datasets along with their characteristics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Protein Dataset**: Contains 45,730 samples and 10 features.
2. **KeggD Dataset**: Contains 53,414 samples and 23 features.
3. **KeggUD Dataset**: Contains 65,554 samples and 28 features.
4. **Parkinson Dataset**: Contains 1,040 samples and 24 features.
5. **TotalBrainVolume Dataset**: Contains 867 samples.

The paper also states that the last dataset, TotalBrainVolume, is a private dataset related to preterm infants, while the other four datasets are publicly available from the UCI repository.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The UCI datasets are typically well-documented, and I can find their citations in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Protein Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Protein

- **KeggD Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/KeggD

- **KeggUD Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/KeggUD

- **Parkinson Dataset**:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson

- **TotalBrainVolume Dataset**: This dataset is private and does not have a public citation. However, it is mentioned that it is provided by the "perinatal brain damage" group at the Biomedical Research and Innovation Institute of Cádiz (INiBICA) and the Puerta del Mar University Hospital, Cádiz, Spain.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
