To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Adaptation for French Named Entity Recognition" by Arjun Choudhry et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in French due to a lack of large, labeled datasets, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Datasets and Preprocessing)**, as this section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors list three labeled source datasets:

1. **WikiNER French**: This dataset is used for supervised training in the NER model.
2. **WikiNeural French**: Another dataset utilized for the same purpose as WikiNER.
3. **Europeana French**: This dataset contains text extracted from historic European newspapers using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but it is noted to have some OCR errors.

In addition to these labeled datasets, the authors mention using the **Leipzig Mixed French corpus** as an unlabeled target corpus for adaptation purposes. This corpus is important for understanding the model's performance in adapting to larger, unlabeled datasets.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
