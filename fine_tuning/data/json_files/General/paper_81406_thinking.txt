To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CapsDeMM: Capsule network for Detection of Munro’s Microabscess in skin biopsy images" by Anabik Pal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves a dataset of **273 real-life images** used for detecting Munro’s Microabscess, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe the process of collecting skin biopsy samples from **120 patients** and mention that the dataset consists of **273 whole slide images (WSI)**, with specific counts of images containing and not containing Munro’s Microabscess. This section also details the annotation process and the criteria for including images in the dataset.

In this section, I will note the following key points:
- The dataset includes **88 images with Munro’s Microabscess** and **185 images without it**.
- The images are labeled by two experts, and only those with agreement are included.
- The dataset also consists of **886 patches with neutrophils** and **1700 patches without neutrophils**, which are cropped from the WSI images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is a novel dataset created by the authors. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available for contact through Prof. Utpal Garain, as mentioned in the paper.

Since the dataset is original and not previously published, I will summarize it as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Skin Biopsy Images for Munro’s Microabscess Detection
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 273 whole slide images (WSI) collected from 120 patients, annotated for the presence of Munro’s Microabscess. The dataset includes 88 images with Munro’s Microabscess and 185 images without it, along with 886 patches containing neutrophils and 1700 patches without neutrophils.
- **Citation**: Not applicable (original dataset created by the authors). For access, contact Prof. Utpal Garain (utpal@isical.ac.in).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry in a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and provided the necessary citation information, even if it is not a traditional reference.
