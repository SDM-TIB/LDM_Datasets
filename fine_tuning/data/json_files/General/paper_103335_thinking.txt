To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAM-loss: Towards Learning Spatially Discriminative Feature Representations" by Chaofei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset contains 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. It is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks.

2. **Mini-ImageNet**: This dataset is a subset of ImageNet, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for few-shot learning tasks.

3. **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**: These datasets consist of 32x32 pixel RGB images, with CIFAR-10 containing 10 classes and CIFAR-100 containing 100 classes. Each dataset has 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

4. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset contains 5,994 training and 5,794 testing images of 200 bird species, often used for fine-grained classification tasks.

5. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset includes 12,000 training and 8,580 testing images of 120 dog breeds, also used for fine-grained classification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 3630–3638, 2016.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:
  > Aditya Khosla, Nityananda Jayadevaprakash, Bangpeng Yao, and Fei-Fei Li. *Novel dataset for fine-grained image categorization: Stanford dogs*. In Proc. CVPR Workshop on Fine-Grained Visual Categorization, volume 2, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
