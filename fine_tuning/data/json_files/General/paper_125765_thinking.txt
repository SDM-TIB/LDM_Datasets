To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auditory distraction in open-plan office environments: The effect of multi-talker acoustics" by Manuj Yadav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on auditory distraction in open-plan offices, which suggests that there may be datasets related to cognitive performance and subjective distraction in different acoustic environments.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the parts that describe the experimental design and the sound environments used. In this section, the authors detail the different configurations of talkers and masking noise, which implies that there are datasets related to the experimental conditions.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **results section**. Here, the authors present findings related to cognitive performance and subjective distraction ratings, which may be derived from the datasets collected during the experiments. I will note any tables or figures that summarize these results, as they often contain key data points.

In the **discussion section**, the authors may reference previous studies or datasets that informed their research. I will pay attention to any citations or mentions of datasets that are relevant to their findings.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have accurate and complete references for each dataset.

Based on my review, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **Sound Environment Configurations**: This dataset includes details about the different sound environments simulated during the experiments, such as the number of active talkers and the presence of masking noise. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yadav, M., Kim, J., Cabrera, D., & de Dear, R. (2017). Auditory distraction in open-plan office environments: The effect of multi-talker acoustics. *Applied Acoustics*, 126, 68-80. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.05.011

2. **Cognitive Performance Scores**: This dataset contains the scores from cognitive tests administered to participants under different sound environments. The citation for this dataset is the same as above.

3. **Subjective Distraction Ratings**: This dataset includes participants' ratings of their subjective distraction levels in various sound environments. The citation for this dataset is also the same as above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
