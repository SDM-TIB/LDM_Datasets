To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mid-price Prediction Based on Machine Learning Methods with Technical and Quantitative Indicators" by Adamantios Ntakarisa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **high-frequency limit order book data from Nasdaq Nordic**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset for their study.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe their approach to mid-price prediction and mention that they utilized **over 4.5 million events** from the limit order book data. This is a significant dataset, but I need to find the exact citation or reference for it.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their findings based on the dataset, but they do not provide additional datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the primary dataset mentioned earlier.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a benchmark dataset for mid-price prediction of limit order book data, which is crucial for proper citation. The relevant reference is:

- Ntakaris, A., Magris, M., Kanniainen, J., Gabbouj, M., & IosiÔ¨Ådis, A. (2017). *Benchmark dataset for mid-price prediction of limit order book data*. CoRR, abs/1705.03233. Available from: http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03233.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **High-frequency limit order book data from Nasdaq Nordic**: This dataset contains over 4.5 million events used for mid-price prediction.

Now, I will prepare the structured output for this dataset, ensuring that the citation is included for proper referencing.
