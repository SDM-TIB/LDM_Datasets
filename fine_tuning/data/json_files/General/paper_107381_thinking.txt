To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-band Solution for Interacting with Energy-Neutral Devices" by Chesney Buyle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Methodology," "Experiments," or "Results."** In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments, including any performance evaluations or comparisons made.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references to datasets that may be included in the text. For instance, if the authors mention practical measurements conducted in a specific testbed (like "Techtile"), I will check if they provide details about the dataset used in those measurements.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper references a specific energy harvesting chipset or a testbed, I will ensure to locate the corresponding citation that provides more information about that dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include details such as the name of the dataset, its purpose, and any relevant metrics or characteristics that were highlighted in the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with accurate citations for each dataset referenced.
