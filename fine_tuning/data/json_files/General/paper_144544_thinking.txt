To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strengthened Symbol Binding Makes Large Language Models Reliable Multiple-Choice Selectors" by Kuo Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several commonly used MCQ benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Experimental Background)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)**: This dataset is described as containing 4-option multiple-choice questions across a wide range of subjects, including STEM, humanities, and social sciences.

2. **CommonsenseQA (CSQA)**: This dataset consists of 5-option multiple-choice questions that draw upon concepts from ConceptNet, allowing for a variety of tasks and fields.

In this section, the authors provide details about the structure of these datasets, including the number of options and the nature of the questions, which is crucial for understanding their application in the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding*. Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

- For **CommonsenseQA (CSQA)**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A Question Answering Challenge Targeting Commonsense Knowledge*. Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 4149â€“4158, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
