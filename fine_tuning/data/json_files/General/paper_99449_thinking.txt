To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextual HyperNetworks for Novel Feature Adaptation" by Angus Lamb et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors assess the performance of their proposed method across various applications, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three different application scenarios: recommender systems, healthcare, and e-learning. I will look for specific datasets associated with each of these applications.

1. **MovieLens-1M Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned in Section 4.2. It consists of 1 million ratings given by users to movies. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset, including its size and the nature of the data (ratings from 8094 users to 5660 movies).

2. **Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis Simulator**: In Section 4.3, the authors describe using synthetic data generated by this simulator for healthcare applications. They mention that the data is binary, indicating the presence or absence of a diagnostic label.

3. **E-learning Dataset**: In Section 4.4, the authors refer to a dataset provided by the e-learning provider Eedi, which contains responses from students to various questions. They specify that the dataset includes approximately 2.7 million responses.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MovieLens-1M Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. *ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TIIS)*, 5(4), 1-19.

- For the **Neuropathic Pain Diagnosis Simulator**, the citation is:

- For the **E-learning Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Z., Lamb, A., Saveliev, E., Cameron, P., Zaykov, Y., Hern√°ndez-Lobato, J. M., Turner, R. E., Baraniuk, R. G., Barton, C., & Jones, S. P. (2020). Diagnostic Questions: The NeurIPS 2020 Education Challenge. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.12061*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
