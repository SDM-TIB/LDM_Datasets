To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RePaint: Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Andreas Lugmayr et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validate their method on **CelebA-HQ** and **ImageNet**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors discuss their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention using **CelebA-HQ** and **ImageNet** for their experiments, confirming that these are the datasets they utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CelebA-HQ**: The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CelebA-HQ**: A dataset for face attributes, widely used in image processing tasks.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for visual recognition, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their respective citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
