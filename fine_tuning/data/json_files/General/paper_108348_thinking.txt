To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Image Stitching Using Depth Maps" by Tianli Liao and Nan Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using the **MVS-Synth Dataset** for quantitative comparisons. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

I will look for any specific details about the **MVS-Synth Dataset** in the text. The authors reference it multiple times, particularly in the context of their experimental results and comparisons with other methods. I will note down the relevant information about the dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the **MVS-Synth Dataset**. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and should include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the **MVS-Synth Dataset** as follows:
> Po-Han Huang, Kevin Matzen, Johannes Kopf, Narendra Ahuja, and Jia-Bin Huang. *Deepmvs: Learning multi-view stereopsis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **MVS-Synth Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed natural image stitching method. It is designed for multi-view stereo tasks and contains various scenes to test the effectiveness of the stitching algorithms.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper.
