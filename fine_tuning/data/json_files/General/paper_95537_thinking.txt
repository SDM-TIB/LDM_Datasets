To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multitask Learning and Joint Optimization for Transformer-RNN-Transducer Speech Recognition" by Jae-Jin Jeon and Eesung Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments utilizing the **Librispeech datasets**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors mention that they used the **Librispeech dataset** for training their ASR systems. They describe the dataset as a widely used corpus for automatic speech recognition, which is a strong indication that it is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Librispeech dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the **Librispeech dataset** for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details from the paper regarding the dataset used in the research.
