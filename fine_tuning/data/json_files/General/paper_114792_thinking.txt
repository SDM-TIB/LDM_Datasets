To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-Supervised Video Inpainting with Cycle Consistency Constraints" by Zhiliang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset tailored for semi-supervised video inpainting, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract. The introduction further emphasizes the limitations of existing datasets for the proposed task, suggesting that the authors have developed a new dataset.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their newly created dataset in the **experiments section**. They mention that their dataset consists of 4,453 video clips and is generated using real-world image patches to simulate corrupted video scenarios.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the **Youtube-vos** dataset as a basis for their generated dataset. The citation for the Youtube-vos dataset is:

- For **Youtube-vos**:
  > Ning Xu, Linjie Yang, Yuchen Fan, Jianchao Yang, Dingcheng Yue, Yuchen Liang, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, and Thomas Huang. *Youtube-vos: Sequence-to-sequence video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 603–619, 2018.

The authors also mention using the **DAVIS** dataset for evaluation, which is another important dataset to include. The citation for the DAVIS dataset is:

- For **DAVIS**:
  > F. Perazzi, J. Pont-Tuset, B. McWilliams, L. Van Gool, M. Gross, and A. Sorkine-Hornung. *A benchmark dataset and evaluation methodology for video object segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 724–732, 2016.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity. The datasets identified are:

1. **Newly Created Dataset for Semi-Supervised Video Inpainting**: Contains 4,453 video clips generated to simulate corrupted video scenarios.
2. **Youtube-vos Dataset**: Used as a basis for generating the new dataset.
3. **DAVIS Dataset**: Used for evaluation of the proposed method.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
