To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Visual-Language Models Are Also Good Classifiers: A Study of In-Context Multimodal Fake News Detection" by Ye Jiang and Yimin Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their framework on three publicly available FND datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PolitiFact**: This dataset contains political news articles classified as fake or real by specialized assessors. The authors note that it consists of 198 articles, with 96 labeled as fake and 102 as real.

2. **GossipCop**: This dataset includes entertainment narratives evaluated on a scale from 0 to 10, where narratives with scores below five are classified as fake news. The authors report a total of 6,805 articles in this dataset.

3. **Weibo**: This dataset is derived from a Chinese social media platform and includes both textual and visual elements. The authors mention that it contains 7,853 articles, with real news sourced from Xinhua News and fake articles from Weibopiyao.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PolitiFact**:
  > Shu, K., Mahudeswaran, D., Wang, S., Lee, D., & Liu, H. (2020). FakeNewsNet: A data repository with news content, social context, and spatiotemporal information for studying fake news on social media. *Big Data*, 8(3), 171-188.

- For **GossipCop**:
  > Long, Y., Lu, Q., Xiang, R., Li, M., & Huang, C.-R. (2017). Fake news detection through multi-perspective speaker profiles. In *Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers)*, 252-256.

- For **Weibo**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the information effectively for further processing or review.
