To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperspherically Regularized Networks for Self-Supervision" by Aiden Durrant and Georgios Leontidis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the experimental setup, as they usually detail the datasets employed for training and evaluation.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets like **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, or ImageNet**, I will highlight these mentions and look for detailed descriptions, such as the number of samples, classes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for any further processing or review. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets or citations in the research paper.
