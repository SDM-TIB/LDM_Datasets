To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bandwidth Reduction using Importance Weighted Pruning on Ring AllReduce" by Zehua Cheng and Zhenghua Xu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the training of large deep learning models and mentions the use of **ImageNet** for evaluating their proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they tested their approach on **ImageNet** and **CIFAR10** datasets. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
