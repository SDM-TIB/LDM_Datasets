To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Audio Spatialization with Correspondence Classifier" by Yu-Ding Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a large-scale video dataset with spatial audio, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for training their model. They mention that they collected a video dataset consisting of two categories: **SP-RACING** and **SP-MUSIC**. The details provided include the total length of videos for each category, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **table 1** within the experimental results section, the authors provide statistics about the datasets:
- **SP-RACING**: 6.8 hours of video
- **SP-MUSIC**: 2.5 hours of video

This confirms the existence of two distinct datasets, and I will note their names and descriptions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to these datasets. However, the authors mention that the dataset will be released to the public upon acceptance of the paper, which means there may not be a formal citation yet. Instead, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details. Since the datasets are original and not previously published, I will indicate that they are forthcoming.

Finally, I will prepare to present the dataset entries, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary information for each dataset, including their names and descriptions, while acknowledging the lack of formal citations at this time.
