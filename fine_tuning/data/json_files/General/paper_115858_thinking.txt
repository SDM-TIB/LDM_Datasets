To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Genetic Algorithms to Simulate Evolution" by Manasa Josyula, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but does not specify any datasets. However, it does mention the use of genetic algorithms to simulate evolution, which may imply the use of simulated data.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the principles of genetic algorithms and their applications but does not mention specific datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the author describes how the genetic algorithm was implemented, including parameters like speed, size, and cloning probability. However, there are no specific datasets referenced here either.

Moving on to the **results section**, the author discusses the outcomes of simulations based on varying initial food counts (100, 200, and 300). While this section provides valuable insights into the simulation results, it does not cite any external datasets or provide specific dataset names.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations that might relate to datasets used in the research. The references include various works related to genetic algorithms and evolutionary principles, but they do not specify datasets used in the simulations.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the research primarily focuses on the simulation of evolution using genetic algorithms rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets. The data collected during the simulations (e.g., average size, speed, cloning probability, and population growth) is generated by the author's own model rather than sourced from external datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned or cited in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract with full citations. Instead, I will summarize the findings based on the simulated data generated by the author's methodology.

In summary, I will document that the paper does not reference any external datasets, and the data presented is derived from the author's own simulations using genetic algorithms.
