To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of Modular Vehicle Technology to Mitigate Bus Bunching" by Zaid Saeed Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for what to expect. The introduction often discusses previous work and may reference datasets used in those studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their simulations or analyses. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any datasets from prior research, I will note those as well.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **macroscopic simulation** to evaluate their proposed strategy. I will check for any specific datasets used in this simulation. If they mention any datasets, I will extract the details, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the **Next Future Transportation dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset and provide any available details.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, including their full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and presented clearly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
