To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Development of an accessible 10-year Digital CArdioVAscular (DiCAVA) risk assessment: a UK Biobank study" by Nikola Dolezalova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mention of the UK Biobank, as it is likely the primary dataset used in this study. The introduction discusses the context of cardiovascular diseases and the need for improved risk assessment models, which may lead to the identification of relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their analysis. Here, they mention that the UK Biobank dataset is a prospective cohort study comprising 502,488 UK participants. This is a significant dataset for the study, and I will note its details.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets or subsets of data that may have been analyzed. The authors discuss the outcomes and characteristics of the participants, which may provide further insights into the dataset's structure and variables.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The UK Biobank is a well-known dataset, and its citation will be crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the UK Biobank is:
> Sudlow C, Gallacher J, Allen N, Beral V, Burton P, Danesh J, et al. *UK Biobank: An Open Access Resource for Identifying the Causes of a Wide Range of Complex Diseases of Middle and Old Age*. PLOS Med. 2015 Mar 31;12(3):e1001779.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UK Biobank dataset as it is the primary dataset used in the study. This will ensure proper attribution and clarity in the dataset extraction process.
