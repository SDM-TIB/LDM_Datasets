To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uplift and Upsample: Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation with Uplifting Transformers" by Moritz Einfalt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they evaluate their method on two popular benchmark datasets: **Human3.6M** and **MPI-INF-3DHP**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset is noted as the most common dataset for indoor 3D human pose estimation, consisting of 11 actors performing 15 different actions, recorded by four stationary RGB cameras at 50 Hz.

2. **MPI-INF-3DHP**: This dataset is described as a smaller but more challenging dataset for single-person 3D human pose estimation, featuring a variety of actions in diverse environments, recorded with 14 RGB cameras.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Human3.6M**, the citation is:
  > Catalin Ionescu, Dragos Papava, Vlad Olaru, and Cristian Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large Scale Datasets and Predictive Methods for 3D Human Sensing in Natural Environments*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(7):1325â€“1339, Jul 2014.

- For **MPI-INF-3DHP**, the citation is:
  > Dushyant Mehta, Helge Rhodin, Dan Casas, Pascal Fua, Oleksandr Sotnychenko, Weipeng Xu, and Christian Theobalt. *Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation In The Wild Using Improved CNN Supervision*. 2017 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV), Oct. 2017.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the specified requirements. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation, ready for any further processing or review.
