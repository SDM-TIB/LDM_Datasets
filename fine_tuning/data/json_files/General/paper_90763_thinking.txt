To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RGBD-Dog: Predicting Canine Pose from RGBD Sensors" by Sin√©ad Kearney et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors generated a dataset of synthetic RGBD images from motion capture data of dogs, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being discussed.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset generation process in detail in **Section 3.1 (Animal Motion Data Collection)** and **Section 3.2 (Synthetic RGBD Data Generation)**. Here, they mention that they recorded motion data from multiple dogs and generated synthetic images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

The key datasets identified in the paper include:

1. **Dog Motion Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3D marker locations, skeleton data, and RGBD images recorded from multiple dogs during various actions. The authors mention that they recorded data from 16 dogs, focusing on five for training and two for testing.

2. **Synthetic RGBD Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the motion capture data and includes approximately 834,650 frames of synthetic images created using a linear blend skinning technique applied to the neutral mesh of the dogs.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors reference previous works that may have datasets relevant to their study, such as:

- **Biggs et al. (2018)**: This paper provides a dataset of 20 landmarks for 218 frames from video sequences of dogs, which could be relevant for comparison.
- **Cao et al. (2019)**: This work discusses cross-domain adaptation for animal pose estimation and may reference datasets that could be useful.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that highlights the key aspects of each dataset, including their purpose, size, and any relevant details about their generation or use in the study.
