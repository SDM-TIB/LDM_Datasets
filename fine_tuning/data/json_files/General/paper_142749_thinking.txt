To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Multi-Query Slot Attention for Unsupervised Object Discovery" by Rishav Pramanik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results and ablations are conducted on the **PASCAL-VOC 2012 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research presented.

Next, I will look into the **results section** to confirm the dataset's usage and any additional datasets that may be mentioned. In the results section, the authors specifically state that all experiments are conducted on the **PASCAL-VOC 2012 dataset**. This confirms that it is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PASCAL-VOC 2012 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. In International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **PASCAL-VOC 2012 dataset** is the only dataset referenced in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach allows me to extract and document the dataset information accurately.
