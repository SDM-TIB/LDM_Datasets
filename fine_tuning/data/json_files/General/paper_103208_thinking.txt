To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StackGAN: Facial image generation optimizations" by Belhiti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model using the **CelebA facial image dataset**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods section**. The authors describe their training process and confirm that they used the **CelebA dataset**, which contains approximately 200,000 facial images. They also mention the preprocessing steps taken to convert RGB images into grayscale and edge images, but they do not introduce any new datasets beyond CelebA.

I will then check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced or if the authors discuss the performance of their model on other datasets. However, the focus remains on the **CelebA dataset** throughout the paper.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CelebA dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., et al. 2016. Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset. http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html (Accessed 22 March 2021).

Since the paper primarily discusses the **CelebA dataset** and does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the **CelebA dataset**, and I will prepare the entry accordingly.
