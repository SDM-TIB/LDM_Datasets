To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translating Natural Language Instructions for Behavioral Robot Navigation with a Multi-Head Attention Mechanism" by Patricio Cerda-Mardini et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenge of developing robotic agents that can follow natural language instructions but do not mention specific datasets. However, they reference previous works that may have used datasets, which could be useful for further investigation.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, where the authors mention using a dataset introduced in (Zang et al., 2018a). This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments. I will look for more details about this dataset in the **experimental setup** section.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors state that they use the dataset from (Zang et al., 2018a) with original train and test splits, including 10,040 instructions distributed across 100 maps. However, they do not provide a name for the dataset itself. I will need to refer to the citation for (Zang et al., 2018a) to find the dataset's name and details.

Now, I will check the **References section** to locate the full citation for the dataset mentioned in (Zang et al., 2018a). The citation is as follows:

- For the dataset referenced in (Zang et al., 2018a):
  > Xiaoxue Zang, Ashwini Pokle, Marynel Vázquez, Kevin Chen, Juan Carlos Niebles, Alvaro Soto, and Silvio Savarese. *Translating navigation instructions in natural language to a high-level plan for behavioral robot navigation*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2657–2666, Brussels, Belgium, October-November. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the authors do not provide a specific name for the dataset in the paper, I will refer to it as the "Zang Navigation Dataset" for clarity in my dataset entry.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will allow for proper attribution and reference in any further analysis or processing.
