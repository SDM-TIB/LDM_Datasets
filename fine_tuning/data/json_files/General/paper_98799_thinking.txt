To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benign Overfitting of Constant-Stepsize SGD for Linear Regression" by Difan Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for validation and testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments, as well as any citations that provide further details about these datasets. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "CIFAR-10" dataset, I will note down the details provided in the paper, such as the number of images, classes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
