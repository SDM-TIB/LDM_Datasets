To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuLTI: Efficient Video-and-Language Understanding with Text-Guided MultiWay-Sampler and Multiple Choice Modeling" by Jiaqi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that MuLTI achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Pretraining Datasets"** and **"Downstream Tasks and Datasets."** In the **"Pretraining Datasets"** section, the authors mention two datasets used for pretraining:

1. **WebVid-2M**: This dataset contains 2.5 million video-text pairs.
2. **CC-3M**: This dataset contains 3 million image-text pairs.

I will also check the **"Downstream Tasks and Datasets"** section, where the authors evaluate their model on various tasks. They mention several datasets used for video question answering and text-video retrieval:

1. **MSRQ (MSRVTT-QA)**: An open-ended video QA task that includes 10,000 videos and 243,000 question-answer pairs.
2. **MSVQ (MSVD-QA)**: Another open-ended video QA task that includes 1,970 videos and 50,000 question-answer pairs.
3. **TGIF-QA**: This dataset contains multiple-choice video QA tasks and is divided into three datasets: TGIF-Action, TGIF-Transition, and TGIF-Frame.
4. **MSRR (MSRVTT-Ret)**: This dataset contains 10,000 videos with 200,000 annotations.
5. **DiDeMo (DiDeMo-Ret)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 videos with 40,000 annotations.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
