To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VoroNav: Voronoi-based Zero-shot Object Navigation with Large Language Model" by Pengying Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions extensive evaluation on **HM3D** and **HSSD**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will delve into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets. Here, they describe:

1. **HM3D Dataset**: This dataset consists of 20 high-fidelity reconstructions of entire buildings and includes 2,000 validation episodes for object navigation tasks.

2. **HSSD Dataset**: This dataset contains 40 high-quality synthetic scenes and includes 1,200 validation episodes for object navigation.

Both datasets are crucial for the evaluation of the proposed method, and their specific characteristics are outlined in this section.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **HM3D**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, S. K., Gokaslan, A., Wijmans, E., Maksymets, O., Clegg, A., Turner, J., Undersander, E., Galuba, W., Westbury, A., Chang, A. X., et al. *Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D): 1000 Large-Scale 3D Environments for Embodied AI*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.08238, 2021.

- For **HSSD**, the citation is:
  > Khanna, M., Mao, Y., Jiang, H., Haresh, S., Shacklett, B., Batra, D., Clegg, A., Undersander, E., Chang, A. X., and Savva, M. *Habitat Synthetic Scenes Dataset (HSSD-200): An Analysis of 3D Scene Scale and Realism Tradeoffs for Object Goal Navigation*. 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
