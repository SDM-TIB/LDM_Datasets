To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Infinitesimal Jackknife and Combinations of Models" by Indrayudh Ghosal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 8 (Real Data Analysis)**, where the authors describe their application of the methods to the **Beijing Housing Data**. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the dataset, including its source, dimensions, and the specific variables used in the analysis.

In this section, the authors mention that the dataset contains housing prices in Beijing from 2011 to 2017, along with various covariates such as location, size, and building features. They also specify that the dataset was pre-processed to remove missing values and irrelevant columns, resulting in a final dataset of dimensions 15360Ã—51.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Beijing Housing Data. The authors reference it as follows:

- **Beijing Housing Data**: 
  > Ruiqurm. *Kaggle. House price in Beijing*. 2018.

This citation provides the necessary details to reference the dataset properly.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
