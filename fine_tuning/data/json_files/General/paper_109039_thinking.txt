To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CF-ViT: A General Coarse-to-Fine Method for Vision Transformer" by Mengzhao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar headings. In this paper, the authors mention using **ImageNet** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

I will also check the **related work** and **implementation details** sections for any additional datasets that may have been referenced or used in prior studies that the authors built upon. However, it seems that the primary dataset mentioned for their experiments is ImageNet.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 248â€“255.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and their citations clearly. The only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is ImageNet, and I will ensure to format the citation correctly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
