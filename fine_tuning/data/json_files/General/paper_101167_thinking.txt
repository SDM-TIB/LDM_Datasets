To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early-stopped neural networks are consistent" by Ziwei Ji, Justin D. Li, and Matus Telgarsky, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to experiments that involve datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically contains information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics such as the number of samples, classes, or features.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that as it is likely to provide detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the research. I will note down the names, characteristics, and any specific configurations or splits mentioned (e.g., training/test splits).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically appears as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information for output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any future use or reference.
