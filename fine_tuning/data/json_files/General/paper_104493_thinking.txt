To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mRAT-SQL+GAP: A Portuguese Text-to-SQL Transformer" by Marcelo Archanjo JosÃ© and Fabio Gagliardi Cozman, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors produced a translated version of the **Spider dataset**, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section 2 (Preliminary Tasks)**, where the authors discuss the translation of the Spider dataset into Portuguese. They mention that the Spider dataset consists of three files: **dev.json**, **train others.json**, and **train spider.json**. This confirms that the Spider dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of various NL2SQL benchmarks, including the Spider dataset, which contains 200 databases with multiple tables under 138 domains. This table provides additional context about the dataset's complexity and its relevance to their work.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. The authors refer to the **Spider dataset** multiple times, emphasizing its importance in their experiments. They also mention the number of questions in each file, which is useful for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Spider dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yu, T., Zhang, R., Yang, K., Yasunaga, M., Wang, D., Li, Z., Ma, J., Li, I., Yao, Q., Roman, S., Zhang, Z., Radev, D.: Spider: A Large-Scale Human-Labeled Dataset for Complex and Cross-Domain Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Task. https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08887v5. (2018).

Since the authors also mention that they translated the Spider dataset into Portuguese, I will note that the translated dataset is part of their contribution, but the original Spider dataset citation is what I will use.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the Spider dataset, and prepare them for structured output as required.
