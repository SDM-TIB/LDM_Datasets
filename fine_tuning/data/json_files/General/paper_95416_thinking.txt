To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Rubik’s Cube: Twisting Resolution, Depth and Width for TinyNets" by Kai Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experimental results on the **ImageNet benchmark**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1000**: This is a large-scale image classification dataset containing 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories. The authors detail the data augmentation strategies used for this dataset.

2. **ImageNet-100**: This is a subset of ImageNet-1000, containing 100 randomly sampled classes with 500 training images and 5,000 validation images. The data augmentation strategy is consistent with that of ImageNet-1000.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **ImageNet-1000**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-100**, since it is a subset of ImageNet-1000, I will reference the same citation as ImageNet-1000.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
