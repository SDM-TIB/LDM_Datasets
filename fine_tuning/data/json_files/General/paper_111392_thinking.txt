To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case of Exponential Convergence Rates for SVM" by Vivien Cabannes and Stefano Vigogna, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of support vector machines (SVM) and their convergence rates but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced there.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention using a dataset for their analysis. They refer to a dataset with a uniform input distribution on specific intervals, but they do not provide a formal name for this dataset. However, they do mention using the **Gaussian kernel** and **empirical risk minimization** techniques.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any papers that provide datasets relevant to their experiments. The references include various works related to SVM and statistical learning theory, but they do not provide specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will summarize the relevant datasets based on the context provided in the experiments. The authors mention using a dataset with a uniform distribution on the intervals [−1, 1] and [−1, −0.1] ∪ [0.1, 1], but this is more of a description of the data generation process rather than a formal dataset citation.

Given that there are no formal datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors conducted experiments using synthetic datasets generated based on the described distributions. 

In conclusion, I will compile the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Generated with uniform distribution on [−1, 1] and [−1, −0.1] ∪ [0.1, 1].
   - Citation: Not formally cited, as it is a synthetic dataset based on the authors' experimental design.

Since there are no formal dataset citations in the paper, I will document this finding accordingly. The lack of specific dataset names means I cannot provide full citations for datasets as typically required. 

Now, I will prepare the structured output based on the findings, ensuring to note the absence of formal dataset citations.
