To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Stable Symbol Grounding with Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder" by Masataro Asai and Hiroshi Kajino, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or descriptions that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to the experiments conducted with the Zero-Suppressed State AutoEncoder (ZSAE). The authors may refer to datasets used for training or testing their models, such as image datasets for the 8-puzzle or Lights Out puzzle games.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the MNIST dataset, I will look for the citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If they reference other datasets, I will ensure to extract their full citations in a similar manner.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all relevant dataset information is captured accurately and comprehensively.
