To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Promoting Focus on Uncovered Regions in Masked Face Recognition" by Pedro C. Neto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two evaluation databases, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of masked face recognition and reference previous studies. They mention the creation of a synthetic masked face dataset based on VGGFace2, which is a key dataset to note.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the creation of two datasets:

1. **Synthetic Masked Face Data (SMFD)**: This dataset is generated by applying synthetic masks to the VGGFace2 dataset, which includes 3,310,000 face images from 8,631 identities. The authors detail the process of mask generation and the diversity of the dataset.

2. **Real Masked Face Dataset (MFRC-21)**: This dataset was collected during a masked face recognition competition and includes images of 47 subjects, with a total of 470 unmasked images and 940 masked images for reference, and 940 unmasked images and 1880 masked images for probes.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **VGGFace2**, the citation is:
  > Cao, Q.; Shen, L.; Xie, W.; Parkhi, O.; Zisserman, A. *VGGFace2: A Dataset for Recognising Faces across Pose and Age*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 67–74, 2018.

- For **MFRC-21**, the citation is:
  > Boutros, F.; Damer, N.; Kolf, J. N.; Raja, K.; Kirchbuchner, F.; Ramachandra, R.; Kuijper, A.; Fang, P.; Zhang, C.; Wang, F.; Montero, D.; Aginako, N.; Sierra, B.; Nieto, M.; Erakin, M. E.; Demir, U.; Ekenel, H. K.; Kataoka, A.; Ichikawa, K.; Kubo, S.; Zhang, J.; He, M.; Han, D.; Shan, S.; Grm, K.; Štruc, V.; Seneviratne, S.; Kasthuriarachchi, N.; Rasnayaka, S.; Neto, P. C.; Sequeira, A. F.; Pinto, J. R.; Saffari, M.; Cardoso, J. S. *MFR 2021: Masked Face Recognition Competition*. In Proceedings of the 2021 IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), pages 1–10, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
