To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adam-family Methods with Decoupled Weight Decay in Deep Learning" by Kuangyu Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are used to validate the proposed methods. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant statistics. I will extract the names of the datasets and any specific details provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year. I will do the same for any other datasets mentioned, such as **Penn Treebank** or any specific datasets related to image classification or language modeling.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
