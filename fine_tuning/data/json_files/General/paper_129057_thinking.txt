To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhanced multi-fidelity modelling for digital twin and uncertainty quantification," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the significance of digital twin technology and mentions the use of data-driven models, which suggests that datasets may be involved, but I need to look for specific names.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Application of deep H-PCFE for uncertainty quantification)** and **section 4 (Application of deep H-PCFE for the enhanced digital twin framework)**, as these sections likely contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the numerical examples. In these sections, the authors describe various numerical examples and the data used for validation.

In **subsection 3.3.1 (A Pedagogical example)**, the authors mention two datasets:
1. **Low-fidelity dataset (A1)**: Contains 50 points generated from a sinusoidal function.
2. **High-fidelity dataset (A2)**: Contains 16 points derived from a transformed version of the low-fidelity dataset.

In **subsection 3.3.2 (Buckling of plate problem)**, the authors describe the datasets used for simulating the critical buckling load of a plate, which includes:
- **Low-fidelity data**: Generated from analytical formulations.
- **High-fidelity data**: Obtained from finite element simulations.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors reference specific datasets or studies that provide the data, I will ensure to include those citations.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as the number of data points, the type of data (e.g., low-fidelity, high-fidelity), and the context in which they were used.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
