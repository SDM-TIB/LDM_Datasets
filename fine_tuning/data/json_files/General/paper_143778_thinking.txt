To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUGlasses: Continuous Action Unit based Facial Reconstruction with Low-power IMUs on Smart Glasses" by Yanrong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data collection methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their sizes, and the context in which they were used.

In the **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings. The authors may mention datasets when discussing their results, which can help confirm the datasets identified earlier.

I will also consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **OpenFace Dataset**: This dataset is used for ground truth AU values during training. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Tadas Baltrušaitis, Peter Robinson, and Louis-Philippe Morency. *OpenFace: An open source facial behavior analysis toolkit*. In 2016 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pages 1–10, 2016. https://doi.org/10.1109/WACV.2016.7477553

2. **Self-collected Dataset**: The authors mention that they collected their own dataset for the experiments, which includes various facial expressions and action units. Since this is a self-collected dataset, it may not have a formal citation, but I will note it as follows:
   > Self-collected dataset for facial expressions and action units during user studies.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
