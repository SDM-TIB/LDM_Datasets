To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning" by A. Kane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses predictive maintenance and the use of data-driven techniques, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific references.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their predictive maintenance model. They describe the dataset as containing sensor data from a specific machine (MNL15) and list the main parameters considered, which include:

1. **EJECTION-PCT**: Excess material ejected from the machine during production.
2. **EXTRUDER PRESSURE**: Pressure sensor value from the extruder of the machine.
3. **MACHINE SPEED**: Speed of the machine while manufacturing.
4. **ACTUAL-VALUES-INPUT**: Input of raw material given to the machine.
5. **HEATING ZONE**: Temperature reading of each individual section.

This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's content, but I need to ensure I have the full citation for the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there is a specific citation for the dataset used. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be original data collected from the machine MNL15. In this case, I will note that the dataset is proprietary or original to the authors and does not have a formal citation.

Since the dataset is not publicly available or cited from another source, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Sensor Data from Machine MNL15
- **Description**: This dataset includes various parameters collected from the sensors of the tubing machine MNL15, which are used for predictive maintenance analysis.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the information I have gathered. Since there is no formal citation, I will indicate that it is an original dataset from the authors.

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and ready for any further processing or documentation.
