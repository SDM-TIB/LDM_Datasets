To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Deep Compressible Covariance Pooling for Aerial Scene Categorization" by Shidong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "publicly released aerial scene image data sets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **UC Merced Land-Use dataset**: This dataset contains 2,100 images across 21 classes, with each class having 100 images. The image size is 256x256 pixels.

2. **Aerial Image dataset (AID)**: This dataset consists of 10,000 images across 30 classes, with each class containing between 220 to 420 images. The image size is 600x600 pixels.

3. **NWPU-RESISC45 dataset**: This dataset includes 31,500 images across 45 classes, with varying numbers of images per class. The image size is 256x256 pixels.

4. **OPTIMAL-31 dataset**: This dataset contains 1,861 images across 31 classes, with 60 images per class. The image size is also 256x256 pixels.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
