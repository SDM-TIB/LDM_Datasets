To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End to End Dialogue Transformer" by Ondřej Měkota et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, evaluation, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of dialogue systems but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **evaluation section** where they compare their system with existing models. Here, they mention using the **Camrest676 dataset** for evaluation, which is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In **section 4 (Evaluation)**, the authors provide details about the **Camrest676 dataset**: it contains 408 training dialogues and 136 test and development dialogues, specifically within the domain of restaurant reservations. This section also describes the dataset's characteristics, such as the delexicalization of slots.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Camrest676 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Su, J., Carreras, X., Duh, K., and editors (2016). *Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2016, Austin, Texas, USA, November 1-4*.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Camrest676 dataset**.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Camrest676 dataset** based on the information extracted, ready for any further processing or review.
