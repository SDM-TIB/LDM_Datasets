To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis and Adaptation of YOLOv4 for Object Detection in Aerial Images" by Aryaman Singh Samyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **VisDrone DET aerial object detection dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset Details)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They specify that the **VisDrone2020-DET dataset** was utilized for training and testing. The section outlines the characteristics of the dataset, including the number of images, the types of objects it contains, and the challenges associated with aerial images.

The authors describe the dataset as follows:
- The dataset consists of aerial images captured from a multirotor drone, with varying scales of objects due to different altitudes and camera angles.
- It includes a total of 7,019 images for training (6,471 from the trainset and 548 from the valset) and 1,610 images for testing.
- The dataset categorizes objects into two main classes: humans (with subcategories for 'Pedestrian' and 'Person') and transportation (with eight vehicle classes).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VisDrone dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Zhu, Pengfei, Longyin Wen, Dawei Du, Xiao Bian, Qinghua Hu, and Haibin Ling. "Vision Meets Drones: Past, Present and Future." arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.06303, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details and provide the full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.
