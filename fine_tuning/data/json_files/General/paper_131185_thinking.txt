To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Example-Based Framework for Perceptually Guided Audio Texture Generation" by Purnima Kamath et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a method for semantic control over audio textures, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **The Greatest Hits Dataset**: This dataset contains audio and video recordings of a wooden drumstick interacting with various objects. It includes approximately 10 hours of denoised audio split into 977 audio files, each about 35 seconds long. The authors use this dataset to explore attributes like Brightness, Rate, and Impact Type.

2. **Water Filling a Container Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50 audio recordings of water filling a container, each approximately 30 seconds long. The authors develop semantic attribute clusters and guidance vectors for the Fill-Level attribute using this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **The Greatest Hits Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Owens, A., Isola, P., McDermott, J., Torralba, A., Adelson, E. H., & Freeman, W. T. (2016). *Visually indicated sounds*. In 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 2405–2413). IEEE Computer Society.

- For **Water Filling a Container Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gupta, C., Wei, Y., Gong, Z., Kamath, P., Li, Z., & Wyse, L. (2022). *Parameter sensitivity of deep-feature based evaluation metrics for audio textures*. In Proceedings of the 23rd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference, ISMIR (pp. 462–468).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further processing or review of the datasets mentioned in the paper.
