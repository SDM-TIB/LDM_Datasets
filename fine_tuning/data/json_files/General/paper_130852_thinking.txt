To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Is Not All You Need Anymore" by Zhe Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. In this paper, the author mentions using "free English children’s books" as the dataset for training the models. This is a crucial piece of information.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. Since the paper mentions that the dataset is composed of the top 100 books on English children’s literature available at gutenberg.org, I will need to provide a citation for this source. The citation for the Gutenberg project is as follows:

- **Gutenberg Project**: 
  > Project Gutenberg. *Free eBooks for your Kindle, iPad, Nook, or other eReader*. Available at: https://www.gutenberg.org/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: Free English Children’s Books
   - **Description**: A dataset composed of the top 100 books on English children’s literature available at gutenberg.org.
   - **Source**: Project Gutenberg.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation. This ensures that the dataset extraction is thorough and properly referenced for future use.
