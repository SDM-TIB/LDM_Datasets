To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixPro: Data Augmentation with MaskMix and Progressive Attention Labeling for Vision Transformer" by Qihao Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its evaluation, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **ImageNet-1K** for their experiments. They describe it as a dataset containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This is a significant dataset for evaluating image classification models.

Additionally, in **section 4.2**, the authors mention using the **Pascal Context** dataset for semantic segmentation tasks, which contains 4,998 images with 59 semantic classes and a background class. This dataset is also crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method in a different context.

I will now check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009.

2. For **Pascal Context**, the citation is:
   > Roozbeh Mottaghi, Xianjie Chen, Xiaobai Liu, Nam-Gyu Cho, Seong-Whan Lee, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun, and Alan Yuille. *The role of context for object detection and semantic segmentation in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 891–898, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
