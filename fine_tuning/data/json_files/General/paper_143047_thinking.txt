To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Text Summaries Generated by Large Language Models Using OpenAIâ€™s GPT" by Hassan Shakil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of text summarization and mention the use of a benchmark dataset. This indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find its name and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors explicitly state that they used the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** for their evaluations. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of text summarization, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **results section**, the authors analyze the performance of various transformer models using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, confirming its role in the study. This reinforces that I have identified the correct dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28, 2015.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: This dataset consists of a substantial compilation of online news articles, widely recognized as a standard benchmark for text summarization tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach allows me to accurately extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
