To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-criteria Approach to Evolve Sparse Neural Architectures for Stock Market Forecasting" by Faizal Hafiza et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a framework for stock market forecasting, which suggests that there may be datasets related to stock market indices.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention the NASDAQ composite index and the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock market behavior. This indicates that there may be specific datasets related to the NASDAQ index and its historical data.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **section 4 (Capturing behavior of NASDAQ Index and implications of the COVID pandemic)**, the authors describe the segmentation of historical data into different datasets:
1. **Dpr (pre-COVID dataset)**: Historical data from January 2017 to December 2018.
2. **Dcv (within-COVID training dataset)**: Data from January 2019 to August 2020.
3. **Dtest (testing dataset)**: Data from August 2020 to January 2021.
4. **Dhold (hold-out dataset)**: Data from January 2021 to May 2021.

These datasets are crucial for the study as they are used for training and testing the neural architectures.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from the authors' own analysis of the NASDAQ index, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is important to reference the source of the datasets used in the study.

The full citation for the paper is:

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined along with its time period and purpose in the study.
