To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Regularization Can Mitigate Double Descent" by Preetum Nakkiran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their empirical evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets in the context of experiments with random features and convolutional neural networks. I will note down any specific datasets they refer to, including their characteristics and the purpose for which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, I will look for its citation, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

If they mention any other datasets, such as CIFAR-100, I will find its citation as well:
> Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes the full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and for others who may wish to use the datasets in their own research.
