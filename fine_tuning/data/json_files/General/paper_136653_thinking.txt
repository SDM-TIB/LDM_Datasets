To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis Of Takotsubo Syndrome By Robust Feature Selection From The Complex Latent Space Of DL-based Segmentation Network" by Fahim Ahmed Zaman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using echocardiogram videos, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the dataset used. They mention that they used an echocardiogram video dataset from The University of Iowa hospitals, which consists of 300 echocardiograms (140 from TTS patients and 160 from STEMI patients). This section also describes the data acquisition method and preprocessing steps, confirming the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a specific hospital's collection and not a publicly available dataset, there may not be a formal citation like those found for established datasets. Instead, I will note the source as The University of Iowa hospitals.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Echocardiogram Video Dataset**: This dataset consists of 300 echocardiogram videos, with 140 from Takotsubo Syndrome (TTS) patients and 160 from ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Each video contains between 18 to 112 frames, and the left ventricles (LVs) were manually traced by an expert.

Since the dataset is not formally published, I will note the source as follows:
- Source: The University of Iowa hospitals.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring that I include the source information clearly, as it is crucial for proper attribution.
