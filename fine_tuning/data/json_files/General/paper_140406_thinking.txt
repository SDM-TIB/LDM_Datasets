To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HOLMES: HOLonym-MEronym based Semantic inspection for Convolutional Image Classifiers" by Francesco Dibitonto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on different categories of objects, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **PASCAL-Part Dataset**: This dataset contains additional annotations over the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset, specifically bounding boxes for objects and their parts. It is used to evaluate the HOLMES explainability and part localization performance.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors also mention using the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. They describe how they leverage the connection between ImageNet labels and WordNet nodes to extract parts for their experiments.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide mappings for the holonym-meronym relationships for both datasets, which further confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PASCAL-Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, X., Mottaghi, R., Liu, X., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., & Yuille, A. L. (2014). Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts. In *2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 1979-1986).

- For the **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In *2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 248-255).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
