To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PruningBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Structural Pruning" by Haoling Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that PruningBench evaluates various structural pruning methods on a wide array of models and tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **section detailing the PruningBench settings**. Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that the benchmark has been conducted on visual classification and detection tasks, specifically mentioning:

1. **CIFAR100**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images per class.
2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.
3. **COCO**: A dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, which includes over 300,000 images.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets were utilized in their evaluations, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey Hinton. "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks." Communications of the ACM, vol. 60, no. 6, pp. 84-90, 2017.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In Computer Visionâ€“ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. Springer, 2014, pp. 740-755.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented.
