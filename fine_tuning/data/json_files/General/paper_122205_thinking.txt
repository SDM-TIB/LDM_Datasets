To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Sparsity in Pruned Neural Networks to Optimize Large Model Training" by Siddharth Singh and Abhinav Bhatele, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Wikitext-103 dataset** and the **BookCorpus dataset** for training their models. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily. 

For the **Wikitext-103 dataset**, the citation is:
> Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. CoRR, vol. abs/1609.07843. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843

For the **BookCorpus dataset**, the citation is:
> Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtasun, R., Torralba, A., & Fidler, S. (2015). *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.06724.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
