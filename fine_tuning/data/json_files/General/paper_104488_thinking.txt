To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing Binary Sequence Set with Optimized Correlation Properties via ADMM Approach" by Jiangtao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the design of low correlation binary sequences but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will move on to the **introduction** section. Here, the author references various binary sequences and their applications in communication systems, but again, there are no specific datasets mentioned.

I will then check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these often contain details about datasets used for validation or testing. In this paper, the author discusses various algorithms and their performance but does not specify any datasets used for experiments.

After reviewing the **results** and **discussion** sections, I will also look at the **conclusion** to see if any datasets are referenced there. However, it appears that the paper focuses more on theoretical contributions and algorithmic performance rather than empirical validation using specific datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references** section to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works of others. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not point to specific datasets.

Since this paper does not mention any datasets explicitly or implicitly, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none exist in the context of this paper.
