To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating prior knowledge about structural constraints in model identification" by Deepak Maurya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, variables, and the context in which they were used.

In the **case study sections**, the authors describe various experiments and the datasets utilized. For instance, they mention a **steam melting network** with 28 flow variables and 11 flow constraints, which indicates a dataset used for testing their proposed methods. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including how it was generated and its significance in the context of the research.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the original sources.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset generated from a specific model or a previously published dataset, I will extract the citation as follows:

- For the **steam melting network**, if the authors cite a specific study or dataset, I will note the citation in the format:
  > Author(s). *Title of the Paper*. Journal Name, Year, Volume(Issue), Page Numbers.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
