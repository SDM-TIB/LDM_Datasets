To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DNN2LR: Interpretation-inspired Feature Crossing for Real-world Tabular Data" by Zhaocheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **four public datasets and two real-world datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors state that they conducted experiments on several datasets, which prompts me to look for specific names and details.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Employee Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from a Kaggle competition and contains employee access data.
2. **Criteo Dataset**: Another dataset from a Kaggle competition, it consists of display advertising data.
3. **Allstate Dataset**: This dataset is related to claims severity and is also available on Kaggle.
4. **BNP Dataset**: This dataset is used for claims management and is available on Kaggle.
5. **RW1 Dataset**: A real-world dataset from finance applications.
6. **RW2 Dataset**: Another real-world dataset from finance applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- **Employee Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Amazon Employee Access Challenge*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/amazon-employee-access-challenge/data

- **Criteo Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Criteo Display Ad Challenge*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge/data

- **Allstate Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Allstate Claims Severity*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-claims-severity/data

- **BNP Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management/data

- **RW1 Dataset**:
  > Internal Dataset. *Finance Application Dataset 1*. (Anonymized and sanitized for research purposes)

- **RW2 Dataset**:
  > Internal Dataset. *Finance Application Dataset 2*. (Anonymized and sanitized for research purposes)

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. This structured approach ensures that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper, including their full citations, which is essential for proper academic referencing.
