To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Thinking Fast and Slow in Large Language Models" by Thilo Hagendorff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and semantic illusions to evaluate large language models (LLMs). This indicates that these two tests may involve datasets that need to be documented.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **Methods** or **Supplementary Materials**. In the **Methods** section, the authors describe how they developed bespoke versions of the CRT and semantic illusions, indicating that these tasks are part of the datasets they created for their experiments.

I will also check the **Supplementary Materials** for any tables or lists that provide detailed information about the tasks used in the experiments. The paper includes a **Table S1** that lists all CRT tasks and semantic illusions, which is crucial for identifying the datasets.

Now, I will extract the relevant datasets:

1. **Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)**: The authors created 50 bespoke versions of three types of CRT tasks (Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3). These tasks are designed to evaluate intuitive versus reflective reasoning in LLMs.

2. **Semantic Illusions**: The authors also developed 50 semantic illusion tasks, which are designed to trigger intuitive but incorrect responses, similar to the CRT tasks.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the original CRT and semantic illusions literature, which I will need to include in the citations.

For the **Cognitive Reflection Test**, the citation is:
> Frederick, S. Cognitive Reflection and Decision Making. *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, 19, 25–42 (2005).

For the **semantic illusions**, the citation is:
> Erickson, T. D. & Mattson, M. E. From words to meaning: A semantic illusion. *Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior*, 20, 540–551 (1981).

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
