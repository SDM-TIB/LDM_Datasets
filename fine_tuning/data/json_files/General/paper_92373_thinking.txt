To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are you wearing a mask? Improving mask detection from speech using augmentation by cycle-consistent GANs" by Nicolae-C˘at˘alin Ristea and Radu Tudor Ionescu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **Mask Sub-Challenge (MSC)** of the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. They refer to the **Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC)**, detailing its composition: it includes recordings of 32 German native speakers, with a total of 10,895 training samples, 14,647 development samples, and 11,012 test samples. Each sample is a 1-second recording at a sampling rate of 16 KHz.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the dataset in the context of the challenge organized by Schuller et al. (2020), which is the authoritative source for the dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For the **Mask Augsburg Speech Corpus (MASC)**, the citation is:
  > B. W. Schuller, A. Batliner, C. Bergler, E.-M. Messner, A. Hamilton, S. Amiriparian, A. Baird, G. Rizos, M. Schmitt, L. Stappen, H. Baumeister, A. D. MacIntyre, and S. Hantke. *The INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge: Elderly Emotion, Breathing & Masks*. In Proceedings of INTERSPEECH, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
