To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Generative Flow via Invertible n Ã— n Convolution" by Thanh-Dat Truong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Celeb-HQ datasets**, indicating that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluated their method on the **CIFAR-10**, **ImageNet**, and **Celeb-HQ** datasets. They provide some context about the experiments, such as the image sizes used and the performance metrics.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: This is a large-scale dataset containing over 14 million images categorized into more than 20,000 classes. The authors specifically mention using ImageNet with image sizes of 32x32 and 64x64 for their experiments.

3. **Celeb-HQ**: This dataset is a high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, containing 30,000 high-resolution images of celebrity faces. The authors indicate that they trained their model on images sized 256x256.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **Celeb-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
