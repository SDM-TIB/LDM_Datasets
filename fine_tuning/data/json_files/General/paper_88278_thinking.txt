To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Robust Spectral Clustering Algorithm for Sub-Gaussian Mixture Models with Outliers" by Prateek R. Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section often includes information about the characteristics of the datasets, such as the number of samples, dimensions, and any specific properties relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the experiments section, including:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe three synthetic datasets used for evaluating their algorithm:
   - **Balanced Spherical GMMs**: This dataset consists of samples generated from a mixture of three spherical Gaussian distributions with equal sizes.
   - **Unbalanced Spherical GMMs**: Similar to the balanced dataset but with unequal cluster sizes.
   - **Balanced Ellipsoidal GMMs**: This dataset consists of samples from a mixture of ellipsoidal Gaussian distributions.

2. **Real-World Datasets**: The authors also evaluate their algorithm on several real-world datasets:
   - **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 1000 samples of 8x8 grayscale images.
   - **Iris Dataset**: A dataset containing 150 samples from three types of Iris plants, with four attributes each.
   - **USPS Dataset**: A subset of the USPS dataset consisting of 500 samples of 16x16 grayscale images of digits.
   - **Breast Cancer Dataset**: A dataset with 683 samples of benign and malignant cancer cases, described by 9 attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

For example, the citation for the MNIST dataset is:
- **MNIST Dataset**: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly presents the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
