To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Anti-Semitic Hate Speech using Transformer-based Large Language Models" by Dengyi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a new data labeling technique and the collection of online discourse related to anti-Semitic sentiment, which suggests that a dataset has been created or utilized. The introduction further elaborates on the collection of online discourse, indicating that a dataset of approximately 10,000 posts was compiled.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods section**. In section 3.1, the authors describe the data preparation and labeling method, stating that they used the Twitter API to retrieve a dataset of around 10,000 posts relevant to Jewish topics. They also mention that a subset of 3,000 posts was labeled for anti-Semitic sentiment. This gives me the necessary details about the dataset's size and the context in which it was collected.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional insights or metrics related to the dataset that might be useful for understanding its application in the study. However, the primary dataset information is already captured in the methods section.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is based on posts collected from Twitter, I will cite the relevant source as follows:

- For the dataset of posts related to anti-Semitic sentiment:

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation in a clear format. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset's relevance to the research conducted in the paper.
