To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Movie Box Office Prediction With Self-Supervised and Visually Grounded Pretraining" by Qin Chao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments are conducted on a "large dataset of 35,794 movies," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about this dataset in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. The introduction discusses the use of user-generated content keywords from The Movie Database (TMDB) and mentions that they collected metadata for 35,794 movies. This suggests that the TMDB dataset is a key component of their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe how they collected metadata from TMDB, including box office data, and how they utilized user-generated keywords. They also mention clustering 7,700 unique keywords into 1,414 clusters, which further emphasizes the importance of the TMDB dataset in their analysis.

I will also check the **experimental results section** to confirm the dataset's role in their experiments. The authors state that they used the TMDB dataset for their box office prediction model, which solidifies its significance.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the TMDB dataset from the references section. The TMDB is a well-known resource, and while it may not have a formal citation in the same way as academic papers, I can reference it as follows:

- **The Movie Database (TMDB)**: 
  > The Movie Database (TMDB). Available at: https://www.themoviedb.org.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset used in the research, ensuring that the citation is included.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Identify mentions of datasets in the abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections.
2. Confirm the significance of the TMDB dataset in the context of the research.
3. Retrieve the appropriate citation for the TMDB dataset.
4. Document the dataset details clearly, including the citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper while providing proper citations for each.
