To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition" by Xin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed algorithm to "image compression of handwritten digits" and mentions the "MNIST dataset." This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section, where the authors elaborate on the significance of singular value decomposition (SVD) and its applications. I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in this section. However, the introduction primarily focuses on the theoretical background and does not introduce new datasets.

In the **experiments** section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for numerical simulations. The authors mention conducting numerical simulations for "random matrices" and applying the algorithm to "compress images of size 32 Ã— 32 pixels, including the famous MNIST dataset." This confirms the use of the MNIST dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references** section to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide the correct citation as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Used for image compression experiments, consisting of handwritten digit images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that the citation is included for proper attribution.
