To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Low Effort Approach to Structured CNN Design Using PCA" by Isha Garg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the methodology is demonstrated on **AlexNet and VGG style networks on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In this section, the authors summarize their experiments on various architectures and datasets, specifically mentioning:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with millions of images across thousands of categories, commonly used for training deep learning models.

The paper provides a detailed analysis of how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, including performance metrics and architectural configurations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically formatted in a standard way, and I will ensure to include all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
