To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating natural language processing models with generalization metrics that do not need access to any training or testing data" by Yaoqing Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **WMT14**, which is a well-known dataset for machine translation tasks. This is a strong indication that it will be discussed further in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors describe their methodology and the specific datasets used for their analyses. They mention using **WMT14** for training models, which consists of 4.5 million sentence pairs for training.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the WMT14 dataset is as follows:
- **WMT14 Dataset**: 
  > Ondřej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, et al. *Findings of the 2014 workshop on statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of the ninth workshop on statistical machine translation, pages 12–58, 2014.

Additionally, the authors mention corroborating results on multiple other datasets, including **Wikitext-103** and **Reddit**. I will ensure to extract these as well.

For **Wikitext-103**, the citation is:
- **Wikitext-103 Dataset**: 
  > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. Technical Report Preprint: arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

For **Reddit**, the citation is:
- **Reddit Dataset**: 
  > Eugene Bagdasaryan, Andreas Veit, Yiqing Hua, Deborah Estrin, and Vitaly Shmatikov. *How to backdoor federated learning*. In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pages 2938–2948, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
