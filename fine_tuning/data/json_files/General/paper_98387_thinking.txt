To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Euclidean Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization: Optimal Rates in Linear Time" by Raef Bassily, Cristóbal Guzmán, and Anupama Nandi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that are likely to contain detailed information about datasets, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that may summarize dataset characteristics or usage.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will extract their names and descriptions. I will also look for any references to prior works that may have introduced these datasets, as they often provide the necessary citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure that I capture all relevant details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will find its full citation, which might look like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248–2255, 2013.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all necessary information is available for anyone interested in the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with proper citations.
