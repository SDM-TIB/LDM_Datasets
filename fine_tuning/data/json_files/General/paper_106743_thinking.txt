To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Point Transformer" by Chunghyun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on **S3DIS** and **ScanNet**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **S3DIS Dataset**: This dataset consists of six large-scale indoor areas with 271 room scenes. The authors specify that they test on Area 5 while utilizing the other areas for training. This dataset is crucial for their 3D semantic segmentation experiments.

2. **ScanNet Dataset**: The authors mention using the second official release of ScanNet, which contains 1.5k room scenes captured with different sensors. This dataset is used for both 3D semantic segmentation and 3D object detection tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **S3DIS**, the citation is:
  > Iro Armeni, Ozan Sener, Amir R Zamir, Helen Jiang, Ioannis Brilakis, Martin Fischer, and Silvio Savarese. *3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces*. In CVPR, pages 1534–1543, 2016.

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel X Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly Annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes*. In CVPR, pages 5828–5839, 2017.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
