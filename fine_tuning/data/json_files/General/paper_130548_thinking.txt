To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Emotionally Numb or Empathetic? Evaluating How LLMs Feel Using EmotionBench" by Jen-tse Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a dataset containing over 400 situations designed to elicit eight emotions, which suggests that a primary dataset is present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their dataset of 428 situations collected from 18 papers, categorized into 36 factors related to emotions. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references various studies and scales used to assess emotions, which may not be datasets in the traditional sense but are important for understanding the context of the data collection.

The key dataset I have identified is:

1. **EmotionBench Dataset**: This dataset consists of 428 situations categorized into 36 factors related to eight negative emotions. The authors collected these situations from an extensive review of literature, specifically from 18 different papers.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from multiple sources, I will reference the original papers from which the situations were collected. The citation for the dataset can be structured as follows:

- Huang, J.-t., Lam, M. H., Li, E. J., Ren, S., Wang, W., Jiao, W., Tu, Z., & Lyu, M. R. (2023). *Emotionally Numb or Empathetic? Evaluating How LLMs Feel Using EmotionBench*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Location], [Date]. [Publisher/Organization].

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
