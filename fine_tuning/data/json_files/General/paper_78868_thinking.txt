To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Spectral Method for Latent Variable Models" by Matteo Ruffini, Marta Casanellas, and Ricard Gavaldà, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the algorithm's application to text mining models, which suggests that datasets related to text corpora may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains details about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will pay attention to any named datasets or descriptions that indicate the nature of the data used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their application of the algorithm to real-world text corpora, specifically mentioning two datasets:

1. **State of the Union Addresses**: This dataset consists of speeches given by U.S. presidents from 1945 to 2005. The authors analyze this corpus to identify topics and clusters within the speeches.

2. **Dante’s "Divina Commedia"**: This dataset includes the text of Dante's epic poem, which is analyzed to extract topics and clusters based on the chapters of the book.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and publicly available, I will provide the citations based on their common references:

- For the **State of the Union Addresses**, the citation is:
  > The American Presidency Project. (n.d.). *State of the Union Addresses*. Retrieved from https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-menu/state-union-addresses

- For **Dante’s "Divina Commedia"**, the citation is:
  > Alighieri, D. (1979). *La Divina Commedia*, a cura di N. Sapegno. Nuova Italia, Firenze.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further use. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
