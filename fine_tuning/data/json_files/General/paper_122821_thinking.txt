To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple and Scalable Nearest Neighbor Machine Translation" by Yuhan Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions experiments on machine translation in two general settings: static domain adaptation and online learning, which suggests that specific datasets are likely used for these experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In **section 4.1 (Domain Adaptation)**, the authors state that they use a multi-domain dataset for their experiments, specifically mentioning the domains of IT, Medical, Koran, and Law. I will look for specific dataset names and details in this section.

Upon reviewing the text, I find that the authors provide statistics for the datasets used in domain adaptation:
- **IT Dataset**: 223,000 training sentences, 2,000 development sentences, and 2,000 test sentences.
- **Medical Dataset**: 248,000 training sentences, 2,000 development sentences, and 2,000 test sentences.
- **Koran Dataset**: 18,000 training sentences, 2,000 development sentences, and 2,000 test sentences.
- **Law Dataset**: 467,000 training sentences, 2,000 development sentences, and 2,000 test sentences.

Next, I will check the **online learning section** (section 4.2) to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors mention using the **European Medicines Agency (EMEA) dataset** and the **JRC-Acquis corpus** for their online learning experiments. I will note the details provided for these datasets as well.

For the EMEA dataset, the authors do not provide specific statistics in the main text, but they mention it is a widely used document-level dataset. The JRC-Acquis corpus is also referenced, and while specific statistics are not detailed in the main text, it is known to be a multilingual aligned parallel corpus.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the references section to find the appropriate citations for the datasets:

1. **IT Dataset**: No specific citation is provided, but it is part of the experiments conducted by the authors.
2. **Medical Dataset**: Similar to the IT dataset, no specific citation is provided.
3. **Koran Dataset**: No specific citation is provided.
4. **Law Dataset**: No specific citation is provided.
5. **EMEA Dataset**: 
   > Tiedemann, J. (2009). News from OPUS — a collection of multilingual parallel corpora with tools and interfaces.
6. **JRC-Acquis Corpus**: 
   > Steinberger, R., Pouliquen, B., Widiger, A., Ignat, C., Erjavec, T., Tuﬁs, D., & Varga, D. (2006). The JRC-Acquis: A multilingual aligned parallel corpus with 20+ languages.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper along with their citations, ensuring that I have captured all relevant information for each dataset used in the experiments.
