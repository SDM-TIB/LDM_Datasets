To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Self-Learning with Weak Supervision for Speech Recognition" by Milind Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a self-learning scheme and mentions the evaluation on public and internal datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using an **internal voice-assistant dataset** totaling 4500 hours of de-identified utterances from 800K devices. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their model.

Additionally, they refer to the **Librispeech dataset**, which is a well-known public dataset used for training and evaluating ASR models. The paper states that RNN-T models were pretrained on this dataset.

Furthermore, the authors mention the **SLURP dataset**, which is another public dataset used for spoken language understanding tasks. They specify that they evaluated their models on the test partition of this dataset, which contains 13K utterances.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Librispeech Dataset**:
   > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

2. **SLURP Dataset**:
   > E. Bastianelli, A. Vanzo, P. Swietojanski, and V. Rieser. *SLURP: A spoken language understanding resource package*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.13205, 2020.

3. **Internal Voice-Assistant Dataset**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is an internal dataset used by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Internal Voice-Assistant Dataset**: 4500 hours of de-identified utterances from 800K devices, used for evaluating the performance of the ASR model.
- **Librispeech Dataset**: A public dataset used for pretraining ASR models.
- **SLURP Dataset**: A public dataset used for evaluating the ASR model on spoken language understanding tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
