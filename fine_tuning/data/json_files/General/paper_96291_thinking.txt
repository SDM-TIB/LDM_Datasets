To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Value-at-Risk Substitute for Non-Ruin Capital is Fallacious and Redundant" by Vsevolod K. Malinovskii, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus but may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may contain references to datasets used in the analysis or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** for any detailed descriptions of datasets. This is where the author might discuss the data used for simulations or empirical analysis. I will look for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that provide numerical data or empirical findings.

If the paper mentions any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details, such as the number of observations, variables included, and the context in which they were used. I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like "Erlang distribution data" or "Pareto distribution data," I will look for the original sources or papers that describe these datasets and provide their full citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
