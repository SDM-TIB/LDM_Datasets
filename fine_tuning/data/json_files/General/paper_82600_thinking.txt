To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random deep neural networks are biased towards simple functions" by Giacomo De Palma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments but does not specify any datasets directly. This suggests that I need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their results are confirmed by numerical experiments on deep neural networks, but again, no specific datasets are named. This indicates that I should continue searching in the later sections.

I will then focus on the **experiments section** (section 4). This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In subsection 4.1, the authors describe their experiments on the MNIST database, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. They mention that they trained networks on this dataset, which confirms its use.

In subsection 4.4, the authors provide additional details about the MNIST dataset, including how the images were processed and converted into binary format for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the MNIST dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

Since the MNIST dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will document it accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant details for future reference or processing.
