To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Crossword: A Semantic Approach to Data Compression via Masking" by Mingxiao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on data compression, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. In this section, the authors mention that the sample text used in their experiments is taken from the **2005 proceedings of the European Parliament**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, or any specific characteristics that the authors describe. The paper states that the dataset is composed of around **80,000 sentences with over 1.5 million words** in total, and it is divided into two groups: **90% for training and 10% for testing**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **2005 proceedings of the European Parliament**, the citation is:
  > P. Koehn, “Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation,” in Proc. MT Summit, Sep, 2005, pp. 79–86.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the dataset extracted from the paper.
