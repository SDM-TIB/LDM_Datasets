To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "CerviFormer: A Pap-smear based cervical cancer classification method using cross attention and latent transformer" by Bhaswati Singha Deo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two publicly available Pap smear datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Sipakmed Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4049 distinct images of cervical cells, categorized into five groups: intermediate, dyskeratotic, koilocytotic, metaplastic, and parabasal. The dataset is further divided into normal, abnormal, and benign classes. The authors provide details about the number of images in each category and the training/testing split.

2. **Herlev Dataset**: This dataset contains 917 cell images belonging to seven groups, which can also be classified into normal and abnormal categories. The authors describe the distribution of images across these categories and the training/testing split as well.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Sipakmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Plissiti, M.E., Dimitrakopoulos, P., Sfikast, G., Nikou, C., Krikoni, O., Charchanti, A. *Sipakmed: A new dataset for feature and image based classification of normal and pathological cervical cells in pap smear images*. In Proceedings of the 2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pages 3144–3148, 2018.

- For the **Herlev Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jantzen, J., Norup, J., Dounias, G., Bjerregaard, B. *Pap-smear benchmark data for pattern classification*. Nature inspired Smart Information Systems (NiSIS 2005), pages 1–9, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
