To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning based Spectral CT Imaging" by Weiwen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on three large-scale spectral CT datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the **Experimental Setup** section, the authors describe the **2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge**, which contains anonymized patient normal dose abdominal CT images. This is a significant dataset used for their study.

I will also note the details provided about the dataset, such as the number of images, the scanning configuration, and how the dataset was utilized in their experiments. The authors mention that they used 10 anonymized patient images to create a database for traditional CT, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge** is as follows:
> AAPM. Low Dose CT Grand Challenge. In. https://www.aapm.org/GrandChallenge/LowDoseCT/.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **results** or **discussion** sections, to ensure I capture all relevant datasets used in their experiments.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me systematically extract and document the datasets from the paper.
