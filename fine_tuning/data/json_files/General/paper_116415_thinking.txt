To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Regression-Free Neural Networks for Diverse Compute Platforms" by Rahul Duggal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a high-level overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset, metrics and implementation details)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention that they present all results on **ImageNet** and that they carve out a sub-training set of 20,000 images from the original training set to evaluate the rewards and update batch normalization statistics for each sub-network. This indicates that **ImageNet** is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Since the paper primarily discusses the use of the ImageNet dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for the ImageNet dataset, ready for any further processing or review.
