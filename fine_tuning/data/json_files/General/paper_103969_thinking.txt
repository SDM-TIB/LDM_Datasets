To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Equivalence of Different Adaptive Batch Size Selection Strategies for Stochastic Gradient Descent Methods" by Luis Espath et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data availability statement** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the statistical error in stochastic optimization but do not mention specific datasets. Next, I will check the **numerical experiments section** (section 5) for any datasets used in their experiments.

In section 5, the authors describe two objective functions used for their numerical experiments, but they do not refer to any specific datasets. Instead, they provide mathematical formulations for the objective functions, which are not datasets but rather functions used in their optimization experiments.

Next, I will look at the **data availability statement** (section 8) to see if there are any datasets mentioned. The statement indicates that the data supporting the findings of the study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request, but it does not specify any datasets or provide citations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

I will also check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of papers discussing optimization methods and sampling strategies, but they do not appear to reference specific datasets either.

In summary, after reviewing the relevant sections of the paper, I find that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or cited in this research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations as there are none to extract.
