To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A risk measurement approach from risk-averse stochastic optimization of score functions" by Marcelo Brutti Righi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments, results, or applications. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of datasets used for analysis or validation of the proposed methods. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

If the paper includes a **dedicated section on datasets**, I will focus on that section to gather comprehensive information about each dataset. This may include details such as the dataset's size, the type of data it contains, and any relevant preprocessing steps mentioned by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture all necessary citation details, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

If the datasets are not directly cited in the references, I will look for any associated papers or documentation that describe the datasets in detail. This may involve searching for external sources or supplementary materials linked to the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
