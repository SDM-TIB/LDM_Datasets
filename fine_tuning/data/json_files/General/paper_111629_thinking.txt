To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mirror Descent Maximizes Generalized Margin and Can Be Implemented Efficiently" by Haoyuan Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4 in this case), as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments with deep neural networks. They describe the dataset and its relevance to their research. Additionally, they mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for further validation of their findings.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper while providing proper citations for each.
