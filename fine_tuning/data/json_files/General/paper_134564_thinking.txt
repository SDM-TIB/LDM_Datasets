To extract datasets from the research paper titled "I2VGen-XL: High-Quality Image-to-Video Synthesis via Cascaded Diffusion Models" by Shiwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the collection of "around 35 million single-shot text-video pairs and 6 billion text-image pairs," which indicates that these are significant datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for training. They specifically mention two types of datasets: public datasets and private datasets. The public datasets are identified as **WebVid10M** and **LAION-400M**.

1. **WebVid10M**: This dataset is referenced as a public dataset comprising a large collection of videos. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **LAION-400M**: This dataset is also mentioned as a public dataset containing a vast number of image-text pairs. I will similarly look for its full citation in the references section.

In the **References section**, I will locate the citations for both datasets:

- For **WebVid10M**, the citation is:
  > Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In ICCV, pages 1728–1738, 2021.

- For **LAION-400M**, the citation is:
  > Christoph Schuhmann, Richard Vencu, Romain Beaumont, Robert Kaczmarczyk, Clayton Mullis, Aarush Katta, Theo Coombes, Jenia Jitsev, and Aran Komatsuzaki. *LAION-400M: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset:

1. **WebVid10M**: A public dataset consisting of a large collection of videos, specifically designed for video-text retrieval tasks.
2. **LAION-400M**: A public dataset containing 400 million image-text pairs, useful for training models that require alignment between visual and textual data.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
