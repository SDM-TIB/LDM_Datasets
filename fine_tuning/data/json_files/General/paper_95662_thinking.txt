To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Domain-Agnostic Contrastive Learning" by Vikas Verma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments across various domains, including tabular data, images, and graphs. This indicates that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 5)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In **Section 5.1 (Tabular Data)**, the authors mention using **Fashion-MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. They describe how these datasets were utilized in their experiments, indicating that they permuted the pixels and flattened them into vector format for analysis.

In **Section 5.2 (Image Data)**, the authors refer to three benchmark image datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. They provide details about the experimental setup and the results obtained from these datasets.

In **Section 5.3 (Graph-Structured Data)**, the authors mention six benchmark datasets for graph classification: **MUTAG**, **PTC-MR**, **REDDIT-BINARY**, **REDDIT-MULTI-5K**, **IMDB-BINARY**, and **IMDB-MULTI**. They describe how these datasets were used in their experiments and compare their method against a state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
