To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoding in Style: a StyleGAN Encoder for Image-to-Image Translation" by Elad Richardson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the pixel2style2pixel (pSp) framework and its applications, but does not specify any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Applications and Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for various tasks. Here, the authors mention using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for several experiments, which is a well-known dataset for face images. They also refer to the **FFHQ dataset** for StyleGAN inversion and face frontalization tasks.

In **section 4.3**, the authors discuss generating images from sketches and state that they constructed their own dataset for this purpose, derived from the CelebA-HQ dataset. This indicates that they created a new dataset specifically for their experiments, which is important to note.

In **section 4.4**, they mention using the **AFHQ Cat and Dog datasets** for additional experiments, which further expands the range of datasets utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**:

2. **FFHQ Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.
