To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagonalisation SGD: Fast & Convergent SGD for Non-Differentiable Models via Reparameterisation and Smoothing" by Dominik Wagner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for empirical evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, dimensions, or specific characteristics that define them.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several models and their corresponding datasets in the **experimental setup**. They describe models like "temperature," "random-walk," "xornet," and "cheating," along with their characteristics. However, I need to ensure that these models are associated with specific datasets.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide additional details about the models and datasets. For instance, they mention the "textmsg" and "influenza" datasets, which are used in their experiments. I will extract the relevant information about these datasets, including their purpose and any specific details provided.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the references section to find the original sources for these datasets. For example, if the authors cite a dataset from a previous study, I will ensure to include that citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for downstream processing, ensuring that all relevant details are included and properly formatted for clarity and usability.
