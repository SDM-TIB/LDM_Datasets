To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles" by Mehdi Noroozi and Paolo Favaro, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on Jigsaw puzzles, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, particularly focusing on any subsections that might discuss datasets used for training or evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using **1.3 million images from ImageNet** for training their model. This is a significant dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is as follows:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to the **PASCAL VOC dataset** in the context of transfer learning tasks. I will also retrieve the citation for this dataset:
> Everingham, M., Eslami, S.M.A., Gool, L.V., Williams, C.K.I., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
