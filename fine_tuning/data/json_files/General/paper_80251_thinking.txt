To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse PCA via Bipartite Matchings" by Megasthenis Asteris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithm on "real datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their algorithm on the **Leukemia dataset** and several **Bag of Words (BoW) datasets**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **Leukemia Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as comprising 72 samples, each consisting of expression values for 12,582 probe sets. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

2. **Bag of Words (BoW) Datasets**: The authors mention multiple BoW datasets, including:
   - **BoW: NIPS**: A collection of text corpora stored under the “bag-of-words” model.
   - **BoW: KOS**
   - **BoW: Enron**
   - **BoW: NYTimes**: This dataset consists of 300,000 news articles and a vocabulary of 102,660 words.

In the **conclusion section**, the authors reaffirm the effectiveness of their algorithm on these datasets, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the UCI Machine Learning Repository for the Leukemia dataset and provide specific citations for the Bag of Words datasets.

- For the **Leukemia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2013.

- For the **Bag of Words datasets**, the citation is:
  > M. Lichman. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*, 2013.

Since all the BoW datasets are part of the same repository, they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research.
