To extract datasets from the research paper titled "From Large Language Models to Knowledge Graphs for Biomarker Discovery in Cancer" by Md. Rezaul Karim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the construction of a domain knowledge graph (KG) for cancer-specific biomarker discovery, which suggests that there may be datasets related to cancer, genes, and biomarkers involved in the research.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly focusing on the ontology modeling and knowledge graph enrichment processes. This section may provide insights into specific datasets used for constructing the KG, such as those related to genes, diseases, and biomedical literature.

In the **results** and **evaluation** sections, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or validating the models, as well as any references to external datasets that were integrated into the knowledge graph.

Throughout the paper, I will pay close attention to any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note these down carefully.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "PubMed" or "CancerIndex," I will look for the appropriate citation format in the references to ensure I capture the correct source.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is clear and well-organized, ready for any further processing or review.
