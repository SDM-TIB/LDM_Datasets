To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble plasticity and network adaptability in SNNs" by Mahima Milinda Alwis Weerasinghe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that two EEG datasets are used for classification experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **methodology or data section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, section 3.5.1 explicitly mentions the two datasets used:

1. **Wrist Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG data collected from three healthy participants performing wrist flexion, extension, or rest. The data is organized in a 14 by 128 matrix, with 60 samples total (20 samples for each class). 

2. **DEAP Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for emotion recognition tasks and includes EEG samples collected from 32 participants while watching video clips. The pre-processed data consists of 1086 EEG samples labeled into two classes based on arousal levels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Wrist Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Taylor, D., Scott, N., Kasabov, N., Capecci, E., Tu, E., Saywell, N., Chen, J., Hu, J., & Hou, Z.-G. (2014). *Feasibility of NeuCube SNN architecture for detecting motor execution and motor intention for use in BCI applications*. In Proceedings of the 2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), pp. 3221–3225. doi:10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889936.

- For the **DEAP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Koelstra, S., Muhl, C., Soleymani, M., Lee, J.-S., Yzdani, A., Ebrahimi, T., Nijholt, A., & Patras, I. (2012). *DEAP: A Database for Emotion Analysis Using Physiological Signals*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, 3(1), 18–31. doi:10.1109/T-AFFC.2011.15.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
