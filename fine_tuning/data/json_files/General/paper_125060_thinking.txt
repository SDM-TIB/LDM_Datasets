To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nearest-Neighbor Sampling Based Conditional Independence Testing" by Shuai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for testing the proposed methods. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, potentially naming specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their method and its application to both synthetic and real data analyses. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in these sections, particularly in the context of performance evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using **synthetic datasets** generated under specific conditions for their experiments. They describe the generation mechanisms in detail, which is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these synthetic datasets, as they are generated for the purpose of the study.

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to identify any datasets that may have been cited in the context of previous work or methodologies. This section may contain citations for datasets that are foundational to the research or that have been used in similar studies.

In this case, the authors reference several foundational works and methods related to conditional independence testing, but they do not cite any specific datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized. Instead, they focus on the synthetic datasets they created for their experiments.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated synthetic datasets based on specific statistical models to evaluate their proposed method. However, these datasets do not have formal citations as they are not publicly available datasets.

2. **Real Data Analyses**: The paper mentions that the method was demonstrated on real data analyses, but it does not specify which real datasets were used.

Given this analysis, I will compile the information regarding the datasets, noting the absence of formal citations for the synthetic datasets and the lack of specific real datasets mentioned in the paper. 

In conclusion, while I have identified the types of datasets used in the study, I will note that there are no formal citations available for them in the context of this paper.
