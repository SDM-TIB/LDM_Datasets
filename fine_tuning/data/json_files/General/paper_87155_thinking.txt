To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Software defect prediction with zero-inflated Poisson models" by Daniel Rodriguez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Equinox dataset**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Equinox dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the Equinox dataset is part of the Bug prediction dataset and corresponds to a Java framework included in the Eclipse project. This section will give me the necessary details about the dataset's context and usage.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Equinox dataset. The authors reference D’Ambros et al. (2010) when discussing the dataset, which is crucial for providing the correct citation.

The citation for the Equinox dataset is:
> D’Ambros, M., Lanza, M., Robbes, R. *An extensive comparison of bug prediction approaches*. In: Proceedings of MSR 2010 (7th IEEE Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories). pp. 31 – 41. IEEE CS Press (2010).

Since the paper primarily discusses the Equinox dataset and does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on this dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will prepare me for the final output, which will be ready for review or further processing.
