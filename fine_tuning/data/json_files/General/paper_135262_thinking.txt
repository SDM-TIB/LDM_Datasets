To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A New Benchmark and Model for Challenging Image Manipulation Detection" by Zhenfei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called the **Challenging Image Manipulation Detection (CIMD)** benchmark, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose and its two subsets, which is crucial for understanding its structure.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets** section, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, I will look for specific names, characteristics, and the intended use of each dataset. The paper describes two subsets of the CIMD dataset:

1. **CIMD-Raw (CIMD-R)**: This subset consists of 600 uncompressed TIFF images designed for evaluating image-editing-based methods. It includes various types of manipulations such as copy-move, object removal, and splicing, with high-quality annotations provided.

2. **CIMD-Compressed (CIMD-C)**: This subset contains 200 JPEG images that are double-compressed using the same quantization factors (QFs). It is aimed at evaluating compression-based methods for detecting manipulation artifacts.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide external references for the CIMD dataset itself, as it is a new contribution by the authors. However, I will ensure to note that the dataset is available at the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/ZhenfeiZ/CIMD.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and include the necessary citation information:

- **CIMD-Raw (CIMD-R)**: 
  - Description: A dataset consisting of 600 uncompressed TIFF images for evaluating image-editing-based methods, featuring various manipulation types with high-quality annotations.
  - Citation: Zhenfei Zhang, Mingyang Li, Ming-Ching Chang. *A New Benchmark and Model for Challenging Image Manipulation Detection*. Available at: https://github.com/ZhenfeiZ/CIMD.

- **CIMD-Compressed (CIMD-C)**: 
  - Description: A dataset of 200 JPEG images that are double-compressed using identical QFs, aimed at evaluating compression-based methods for detecting manipulation artifacts.
  - Citation: Zhenfei Zhang, Mingyang Li, Ming-Ching Chang. *A New Benchmark and Model for Challenging Image Manipulation Detection*. Available at: https://github.com/ZhenfeiZ/CIMD.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
