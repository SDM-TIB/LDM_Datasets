To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Have Attention Heads in BERT Learned Constituency Grammar?" by Ziyang Luo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions analyzing constituency grammar in attention heads of BERT and RoBERTa, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa on two types of tasks: sentence meaning similarity (SMS) and natural language inference (NLI). This indicates that specific datasets are likely used for these tasks.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods and experiments sections**. The author states that they fine-tune their models on two datasets for SMS tasks: **QQP** (Quora Question Pairs) and **STS-B** (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark). For NLI tasks, they mention using **MNLI** (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference) and **QNLI** (Question Natural Language Inference).

Now, I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **references section** for full citations:

1. **QQP**:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **STS-B**:
   > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Iñigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *SemEval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017), pages 1–14, Vancouver, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics.

3. **MNLI**:
   > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel Bowman. *A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112–1122. Association for Computational Linguistics.

4. **QNLI**:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, Austin, Texas. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
