To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Prune Deep Neural Networks via Layer-wise Optimal Brain Surgeon" by Xin Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, including:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference.
