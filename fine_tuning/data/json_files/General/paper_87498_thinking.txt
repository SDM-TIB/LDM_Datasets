To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Speech Recognition" by Nanxin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that results were shown on **Mandarin (Aishell)** and **Japanese (CSJ)** ASR benchmarks, which suggests that these may be the datasets used.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the experimental setup and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention using **Aishell** and **CSJ** for their experiments. 

1. **Aishell Dataset**: The authors refer to it as a Mandarin speech corpus. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset in the references section.

2. **CSJ Dataset**: This is mentioned as the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese. I will also look for its full citation in the references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citations for both datasets:

- For **Aishell**, the citation is:
  > Hui Bu, Jiayu Du, Xingyu Na, Bengu Wu, and Hao Zheng. *Aishell-1: An open-source mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA), pages 1â€“5, IEEE, 2017.

- For **CSJ**, the citation is:
  > Kikuo Maekawa. *Corpus of spontaneous Japanese: Its design and evaluation*. In ISCA & IEEE Workshop on Spontaneous Speech Processing and Recognition, 2003.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Aishell**: A Mandarin speech corpus used for automatic speech recognition.
2. **CSJ**: A corpus of spontaneous Japanese used for automatic speech recognition.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
