To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-to-Text Logic Jailbreak: Your Imagination can Help You Do Anything" by Xiaotian Zou, Ke Li, and Yongkang Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a novel dataset called **Flow-JD**, which is specifically designed to evaluate the logic-based flowchart jailbreak capabilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs). This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Models and Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their evaluation. They mention two datasets:

1. **Flow-HJD**: This is a hand-made dataset created by manually extracting 70 harmful behaviors from the AdvBench dataset and creating corresponding logic jailbreak flowcharts. This dataset is crucial for evaluating the jailbreak capabilities of VLMs.

2. **Flow-SJD**: This dataset is generated using SDXL to create flowcharts corresponding to 520 harmful behaviors from the AdvBench dataset. This dataset is also important for the evaluation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the AdvBench dataset, which is crucial for understanding the context of the Flow-HJD and Flow-SJD datasets. However, the specific citation for the AdvBench dataset is not provided in the text, so I will note that it may need to be sourced from other literature or databases.

The citation for the **Flow-JD dataset** itself is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned that it is accessible via a GitHub link. I will include this link as part of the dataset description.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format for each dataset:

1. **Flow-HJD Dataset**:
   - Description: A hand-made dataset containing 70 harmful behaviors categorized into 10 categories, created from the AdvBench dataset.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; refer to AdvBench dataset for context.

2. **Flow-SJD Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset generated using SDXL, containing flowcharts corresponding to 520 harmful behaviors from the AdvBench dataset.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided; refer to AdvBench dataset for context.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research, while also noting the need to find the full citation for the AdvBench dataset to complete the dataset extraction process.
