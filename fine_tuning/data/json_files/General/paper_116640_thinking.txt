To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solar Power Time Series Forecasting Utilising Wavelet Coefficients" by Sarah Almaghrabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates a new method using two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Problem Statement and Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that the solar power data is collected from grid-connected large-scale PV plants in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (QLD), Australia. This section provides crucial information about the datasets.

The paper specifies that:
1. The **NSW dataset** consists of data from 12 PV plants with an aggregated generation capacity of 600 MW, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to May 8, 2020.
2. The **QLD dataset** includes data from 19 PV plants with a total capacity of 1106 MW, also covering the same time period.

Both datasets contain half-hourly aggregated solar PV power generation data sampled at 30-minute intervals, resulting in 494 daily vectors for each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The datasets are publicly available online, and the authors reference the Australian Energy Market Operator as the source for the data.

The full citation for the datasets is:
> Australian Energy Market Operator. *Dispatch SCADA*. Available: https://www.nemweb.com.au/REPORTS/ARCHIVE/Dispatch_SCADA/ [Accessed: 2022].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research.
