To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy-Based Feature Selection for Efficient LiDAR SLAM" by Jianhao Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed feature selector is validated with extensive experiments covering various scenarios on two sensor setups. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of LiDAR-SLAM systems and the need for efficient feature selection. While this section provides context, it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for validation. The authors describe their experiments on sequences collected with two platforms: the Real Handheld Device (RHD) and the Oxford Robocar (OR). 

1. **RHD Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset is made for indoor tests and includes sequences such as RHD01lab and RHD02garden. They describe the device used to collect the data and the average speed during collection.

2. **Oxford Robocar Dataset**: This dataset is recorded by driving a vehicle equipped with LiDAR on urban roads. The authors specify that they collected 32 repeated traversals of a 9 km route, which were split into five sequences named OR01 to OR05 for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **RHD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Jiao, H. Ye, Y. Zhu, and M. Liu. *Robust odometry and mapping for multi-lidar systems with online extrinsic calibration*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.14294, 2020.

- For the **Oxford Robocar Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Barnes, M. Gadd, P. Murcutt, P. Newman, and I. Posner. *The Oxford Radar Robotcar Dataset: A radar extension to the Oxford Robotcar Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.01300, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
