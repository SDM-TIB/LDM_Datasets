To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Segmentation Using Overlapping Group Sparsity" by Shervin Minaee and Yao Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the algorithm has been tested on a dataset of images extracted from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental results** section. In the **experimental results** section, the authors mention that their algorithm was tested on a dataset consisting of 332 image blocks of size 64x64, extracted from sample frames of HEVC test sequences. This provides a clear description of the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper cites the HEVC standard test sequences, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's origin. The relevant citation for the HEVC test sequences is:

- For the HEVC standard test sequences, the citation is:
  > ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 Requirements subgroup, “Requirements for an extension of HEVC for coding of screen content,” in MPEG 109 meeting, 2014.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: HEVC Standard Test Sequences
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of images extracted from HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding. The specific dataset used in the experiments includes 332 image blocks of size 64x64.
   - **Full Citation**: ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 Requirements subgroup, “Requirements for an extension of HEVC for coding of screen content,” in MPEG 109 meeting, 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research paper.
