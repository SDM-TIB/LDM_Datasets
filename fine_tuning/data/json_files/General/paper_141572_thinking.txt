To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Symbolic Prompt Program Search: A Structure-Aware Approach to Efficient Compile-Time Prompt Optimization" by Tobias Schnabel and Jennifer Neville, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets from the **BigBench benchmark** for instruction tuning tasks. I will note the specific tasks and datasets referenced in the experiments, such as the **GeoQuery**, **SMCalFlow**, and **Overnight** datasets, as these are crucial for understanding the context of their evaluations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, I will look for citations related to:
- **GeoQuery**: I will find the original paper that introduced this dataset.
- **SMCalFlow**: I will locate the reference that describes this dataset.
- **Overnight**: I will also find the citation for this dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will include clear labeling of each dataset and its corresponding citation, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
