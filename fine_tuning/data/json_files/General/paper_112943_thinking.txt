To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PLATON: Pruning Large Transformer Models with Upper Confidence Bound of Weight Importance" by Qingru Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments with several Transformer-based models on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on several datasets, specifically:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This is a collection of nine different tasks for natural language understanding, which includes datasets like MNLI, QNLI, RTE, SST-2, and others.
2. **SQuAD v1.1**: A dataset for question answering that contains 88,000 training and 10,000 validation samples.
3. **CIFAR-100**: An image classification dataset with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale image classification dataset with 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **GLUE Benchmark**, the citation is:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
