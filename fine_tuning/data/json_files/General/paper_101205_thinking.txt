To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Symbolic Regression that Scales" by Luca Biggio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on five datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Set-up)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **AI-Feynman (AIF)**: This dataset consists of equations extracted from the Feynman Lectures on Physics series. The authors mention that it includes 52 equations with up to 3 independent variables.

2. **Unseen Skeletons (SOOSE)**: This dataset is constructed to have zero overlap with the pre-training set, containing 200 equations that are symbolically and numerically different from those in the pre-training dataset.

3. **Nguyen Dataset**: This dataset consists of 12 simple equations without constants beyond the scalars 1 and 2, each with up to 2 independent variables. It is noted that this dataset was the main benchmark used in a previous study.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors confirm that they tested their model on these datasets, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **AI-Feynman**, the citation is:
  > Udrescu, S.-M., & Tegmark, M. (2020). AI Feynman: A physics-inspired method for symbolic regression. *Science Advances*, 6(16), eaay2631.

- For **Nguyen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Petersen, B. K. (2021). Deep symbolic regression: Recovering mathematical expressions from data via risk-seeking policy gradients. *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

The SOOSE dataset is a new dataset created by the authors and does not have a separate citation, but it is derived from the principles discussed in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
