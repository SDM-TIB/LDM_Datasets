To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open World Object Detection in the Era of Foundation Models" by Orr Zohar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets being discussed. The abstract mentions that the authors curated a new benchmark that includes five real-world application-driven datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Real-World Object Detection Benchmark)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets included in their benchmark. In this section, they list five datasets: 

1. **Aquatic Dataset**: This dataset consists of underwater images of different sea creatures.
2. **Aerial Dataset**: Curated from the DIOR dataset, it includes aerial images of stadiums, storage containers, and other objects.
3. **Game Dataset**: This dataset comprises game snapshots containing different avatars.
4. **Medical Dataset**: It consists of hand X-ray images where different bones are to be detected.
5. **Surgery Dataset**: Taken from the NeuroSurgicalTools dataset, it includes various surgical tools captured by neurosurgical microscopes.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset Details)**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, including the number of training and testing images, as well as the number of classes in each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Aquatic Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
