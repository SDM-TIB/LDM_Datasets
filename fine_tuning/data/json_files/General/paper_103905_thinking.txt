To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System by Using Image Information" by Zong-Ming Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an autonomous simulation software called **Virtual Test Drive (VTD)**, which indicates that there may be datasets related to traffic simulation involved. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **system approach** and **simulation experiment** sections. In these sections, the authors describe their methodology and the parameters they used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any data or datasets referenced, particularly those related to vehicle counts, traffic flow, and simulation settings.

In the **simulation experiment** section, the authors provide details about the experimental setup, including the use of the VTD software to create a simulation map. They also mention collecting data on vehicle speed and traffic flow, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these measurements.

I will also check the **results** section for any tables or figures that summarize the data collected during the experiments. For instance, tables showing vehicle amounts, average speeds, and time lost during the experiments will be crucial for identifying the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or software mentioned. For example, the VTD software is cited as:
> Virtual Test Drive MSC Software. *https://www.mscsoftware.com/product/virtual-test-drive*.

Additionally, I will look for citations related to the traffic flow models or algorithms used, such as the **Greenshields traffic flow model** and **Webster's method**, to ensure I have comprehensive citations for all datasets referenced in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and accompanied by its full citation. This structured approach will help me create a clear and informative output that reflects the datasets used in the research paper.
