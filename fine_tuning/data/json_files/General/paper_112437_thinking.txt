To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Solar Flare Prediction by Time Series Outlier Detection" by Junzhi Wen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate the impact of outliers on a multivariate time series benchmark dataset, specifically mentioning the **SWAN-SF** dataset. This suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (SWAN-SF Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the SWAN-SF dataset, including:

- It consists of 4,075 multivariate time series data instances from active regions of 10,000 flare reports over 8 years.
- Each instance represents a 12-hour observation window of 51 flare-predictive parameters.
- The dataset is labeled based on the strongest flare reported within a 24-hour prediction window.

Since the SWAN-SF dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will ensure to gather all relevant details about it.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SWAN-SF dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

> Angryk, R.A., et al. "Multivariate time series dataset for space weather data analytics." *Nature: Scientific Data* 7(1), 227 (Jul 2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0548-x

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **SWAN-SF Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for solar flare prediction, containing multivariate time series data instances with various flare-predictive parameters.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included, and prepare it for structured output as required. This thorough approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
