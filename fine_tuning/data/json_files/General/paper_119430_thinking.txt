To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Positive Unlabeled Learning with Tensor Networks" by Bojan Žunkovič, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method significantly improves state-of-the-art results on the **MNIST image dataset** and **15 categorical/mixed datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the author states that the model is tested on the **MNIST image dataset** and **15 categorical/mixed datasets from the UCI machine learning repository**. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets used.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the performance of the model on the **MNIST dataset** and the **15 categorical datasets**. I will need to identify the specific names of these categorical datasets, which are likely listed in a table or described in detail.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the **15 categorical datasets** are explicitly mentioned in the results section, along with their characteristics. The datasets include:

1. **Audiology**
2. **Breast Cancer**
3. **Chess**
4. **Credit Approval**
5. **Dermatology**
6. **Heart Disease**
7. **Hepatitis**
8. **Iris**
9. **Lymphography**
10. **Mushroom**
11. **Nursery**
12. **Pima Indians Diabetes**
13. **Soybean**
14. **Spambase**
15. **Vote**

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The **MNIST dataset** is a well-known dataset, and its citation is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

For the **15 categorical datasets**, I will refer to the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is the source for these datasets. The general citation for datasets from the UCI repository is:

- **UCI Machine Learning Repository**:
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
