To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Topic Augmented Generator for Abstractive Summarization" by Melissa Ailem et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they validate their approach on the **CNN/Daily Mail** and **WikiHow** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**: This dataset consists of 312,085 news articles, each paired with a multi-sentence summary (approximately 4 sentences). The authors specify the splits used for training (287,227 instances), testing (11,490 instances), and validation (13,368 instances).

2. **WikiHow Dataset**: This dataset contains about 200,000 pairs of articles and summaries, which are more challenging for abstractive summarization. The authors note that the splits consist of 168,128 pairs for training, and 6,000 pairs each for testing and validation.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **CNN/Daily Mail Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1693â€“1701, 2015.

- For the **WikiHow Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mahnaz Koupaee and William Yang Wang. *WikiHow: A large scale text summarization dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.09305, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
