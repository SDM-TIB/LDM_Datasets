To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reverse Image Retrieval Cues Parametric Memory in Multimodal LLMs" by Jialiang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method on knowledge-intensive visual question answering (VQA) tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **INFOSEEK**: This dataset comprises fine-grained world knowledge questions spread across eleven categories, totaling 1650 samples. The authors reference a previous work for the dataset's structure.

2. **SnakeCLEF**: This dataset is used for the open-ended identification of various snake species, with 300 images sampled from the validation set.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **INFOSEEK**, the citation is:
  > Yang Chen, Hexiang Hu, Yi Luan, et al. “Can Pre-trained Vision and Language Models Answer Visual Information-Seeking Questions?” In: Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Ed. by Houda Bouamor, Juan Pino, and Kalika Bali. Singapore: Association for Computational Linguistics, Dec. 2023, pp. 14948–14968. DOI: 10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.925. URL: https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.925.

- For **SnakeCLEF**, the citation is:
  > Lukáš Picek, Rail Chamidullin, Marek Hrúz, et al. “Overview of SnakeCLEF 2023: Snake Identification in Medically Important Scenarios”. In: CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Vol. 3497. CEUR-WS, 2023. URL: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3497/paper-168.pdf.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
