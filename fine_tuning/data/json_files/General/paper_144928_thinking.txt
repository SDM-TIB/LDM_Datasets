To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smiles2Dock: an open large-scale multi-task dataset for ML-based molecular docking" by Thomas Le Menestrel and Manuel A. Rivas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset construction sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces **Smiles2Dock**, which is a large-scale dataset created for molecular docking, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction**. The authors mention that they docked **1.7 million ligands from the ChEMBL database against 15 AlphaFold proteins**, resulting in over **25 million protein-ligand binding scores**. This suggests that both ChEMBL and AlphaFold are relevant datasets.

In the **dataset construction section**, the authors provide more context about the datasets used:
1. **ChEMBL**: A bioactivity database containing detailed information on **2.3 million small molecules**. This dataset is crucial for drug discovery and provides a rich source of known interactions and compound structures.
2. **AlphaFold**: A machine learning system developed by DeepMind for predicting protein structures. The authors used a set of **15 proteins from AlphaFold** for their docking experiments.

I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:
- For **ChEMBL**, the citation is:
  > Anna Gaulton, Louisa J Bellis, A Patricia Bento, Jon Chambers, Mark Davies, Anne Hersey, Yvonne Light, Shaun McGlinchey, David Michalovich, Bissan Al-Lazikani, et al. *Chembl: a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery*. Nucleic acids research, 40(D1):D1100–D1107, 2012.

- For **AlphaFold**, the citation is:
  > John Jumper, Richard Evans, Alexander Pritzel, Tim Green, Michael Figurnov, Olaf Ronneberger, Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, Russ Bates, Augustin Žídek, Anna Potapenko, et al. *Highly accurate protein structure prediction with alphafold*. Nature, 596(7873):583–589, 2021.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
