To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpaDen: Sparse and Dense Keypoint Estimation for Real-World Chart Understanding" by Saleem Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the problem of chart data extraction, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset they utilized:

1. **Chart-Infographics Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 86,815 real charts sourced from the Open Access section of PubMed Central (PMC). It includes both multi-panel and single-panel charts, with over 36,000 images categorized as single-panel charts used for training and testing. The dataset is rigorously curated and is essential for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The citation for the Chart-Infographics Challenge Dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is referenced in the context of the challenge papers. Therefore, I will cite it as follows:

- For the **Chart-Infographics Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davila, K., Kota, B.U., Setlur, S., Govindaraju, V., Tensmeyer, C., Shekhar, S., Chaudhry, R. "ICDAR 2019 Competition on Harvesting Raw Tables from Infographics (Chart-Infographics)." In Proceedings of the 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1594â€“1599, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2019.00203

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will prepare to compile this information into the required structured format for further processing or review.
