To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CNNPruner: Pruning Convolutional Neural Networks with Visual Analytics" by Guan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss conducting case studies on CNNs with real-world sizes, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as the **related works** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors reference the use of CNNs in various applications, but I need to find specific datasets used in their experiments.

Upon examining the **case studies** section, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit classification and contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **Cat&Dog Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25,000 images of cats and dogs, used for binary classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kaggle. *Dogs vs. Cats*. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) (accessed: 2020-03-10).

3. **Scene Classification Dataset**: This dataset contains 17,034 images across six classes, used for scene classification tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Kaggle. *Scene Classification Dataset*. [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) (accessed: 2020-03-10).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their descriptions and the context in which they were used in the paper. The MNIST dataset was used for a simple CNN classification task, while the Cat&Dog dataset was used for a binary classification task, and the Scene Classification dataset was used for diagnosing the pruning process.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
