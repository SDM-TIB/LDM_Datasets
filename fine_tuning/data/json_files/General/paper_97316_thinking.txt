To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Persistent Anti-Muslim Bias in Large Language Models" by Abubakar Abid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the exploration of biases in GPT-3, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about the biases in language models, but I need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections**. In these sections, the authors describe their experimental setup and the prompts used with GPT-3. They mention using a programmatic API and the OpenAI Playground, but I need to identify any datasets that were utilized for training or evaluation purposes.

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **discussion section**. The authors may refer to datasets used in previous studies or their own experiments, which could provide valuable information.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets might include:

1. **The dataset used to probe biases in GPT-3**: While the paper does not specify a particular dataset for training GPT-3, it references the large corpus of text used for pretraining, which is crucial for understanding the biases.

2. **The dataset curated to measure associations and stereotypes**: The authors mention previous work that curated datasets for measuring biases, which may include specific citations.

3. **Any supplementary materials**: The paper references supplementary materials that may contain additional datasets or details about the experiments conducted.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each one. If the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will reference the relevant studies or papers that introduced those datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
