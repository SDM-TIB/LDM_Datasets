To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing a Sequential Recommendation System for Heterogeneous Interactions Using Transformers" by Mehdi Soleiman Nejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look deeper for specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the dataset is sourced from an online learning platform, which includes user interactions such as course registrations and likes/dislikes. They specify that there are approximately 47,000 users and 630 courses in this dataset.

I will also check the **acknowledgment section**, where the authors thank Maktabkhooneh, the online learning platform, for providing the dataset. This indicates that the dataset is proprietary to this platform.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the dataset. Since the dataset is from Maktabkhooneh, I will need to format the citation appropriately. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, so I will create a citation based on the information available:

- **Maktabkhooneh Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed sequential recommendation system and includes user interactions on an online learning platform.

The citation can be formatted as follows:
> Maktabkhooneh. *User Interaction Dataset for Online Learning Platform*. Available at: [insert URL if available].

Since the paper does not provide a specific URL or publication year for the dataset, I will note that in the citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Maktabkhooneh dataset as required. This will allow for proper referencing in future work or analyses.
