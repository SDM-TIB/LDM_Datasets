To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Dataset Multiplicity Problem: How Unreliable Data Impacts Predictions" by Anna P. Meyer, Aws Albarghouthi, and Loris Dâ€™Antoni, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the concept of dataset multiplicity and its implications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their empirical analysis.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Income Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting whether an individual earns over $50,000. It is derived from the FolkTables project.

2. **Loan Application Register (LAR)**: This dataset is sourced from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and is used to analyze mortgage loan approvals.

3. **MNIST 1/7 Dataset**: This is a subset of the MNIST dataset, specifically focusing on the digits '1' and '7' for binary classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ding, F., Hardt, M., Miller, J., & Schmidt, L. (2021). Retiring Adult: New Datasets for Fair Machine Learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.04884.

- For the **Loan Application Register (LAR)**, the citation is:
  > Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. (2019). One Year National Loan-Level Dataset. Accessed 5 Jan. 2023.

- For the **MNIST 1/7 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. C. (n.d.). The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and provide proper citations, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
