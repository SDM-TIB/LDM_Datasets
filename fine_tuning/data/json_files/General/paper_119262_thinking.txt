To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ontology-Aware Learning and Evaluation for Audio Tagging" by Haohe Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention the use of **AudioSet** and **FSD50K** as large-scale datasets for audio tagging tasks. This indicates that these datasets are significant to the research and likely to be described in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly mention conducting experiments on the **AudioSet balanced subset (AudioSet-20K)**, the **full AudioSet (AudioSet-2M)**, and the **FSD50K dataset**. This confirms that these datasets are used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **AudioSet**: The citation is:
   > Gemmeke, J. F., Ellis, D. P., Freedman, D., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, R. C., Plakal, M., & Ritter, M. (2017). *AudioSet: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. In IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 776–780.

2. **FSD50K**: The citation is:
   > Fonseca, E., Favory, X., Pons, J., Font, F., & Serra, X. (2021). *FSD50K: An open dataset of human-labeled sound events*. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 30, 829–852.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for reference.
