To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Bayesian approach to quantifying uncertainties and improving generalizability in traffic prediction models" by Agnimitra Sengupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a Bayesian recurrent neural network framework for traffic prediction, which suggests that datasets related to traffic data might be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **data section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention that the data is obtained from the **California Department of Transportation’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**, specifically using traffic data (flow, occupancy, speed) recorded by vehicle detector sensors along freeways and ramps. This indicates that PeMS is a primary dataset used in their study.

The authors specify that they used flow data for one year from **VDS 1114805** on California Interstate-05 NB in District 11, which consists of 104,942 samples aggregated every 5 minutes. This dataset is crucial for their model training and evaluation.

Additionally, the paper discusses the evaluation of the model's generalizability on out-of-distribution datasets, specifically mentioning **VDS 1114211** and **VDS 1118170**. These datasets are used to assess how well the model performs on data that differs from the training distribution.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from a government database (PeMS), I will provide a citation for the source of the dataset rather than individual papers.

The citation for the **California Department of Transportation’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS)** is:
> California Department of Transportation. *Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: https://pems.dot.ca.gov/

For the specific VDS datasets mentioned:
- **VDS 1114805**: This is part of the PeMS dataset and does not have a separate citation.
- **VDS 1114211**: Also part of the PeMS dataset.
- **VDS 1118170**: Similarly, this is part of the PeMS dataset.

In summary, I will compile the dataset entries as follows:

1. **California Department of Transportation’s Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**: This dataset includes traffic data (flow, occupancy, speed) recorded by vehicle detector sensors along freeways and ramps.

2. **VDS 1114805**: Flow data for one year from California Interstate-05 NB in District 11, consisting of 104,942 samples.

3. **VDS 1114211**: An out-of-distribution dataset used for evaluating model generalizability.

4. **VDS 1118170**: Another out-of-distribution dataset used for evaluating model generalizability.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the full citations are included where applicable.
