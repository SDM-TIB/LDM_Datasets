To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InfoNCE is a Variational Autoencoder" by Laurence Aitchison and Stoil Ganev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a high-level overview, while the introduction often contextualizes the research and may reference datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention generating a dataset of 900 images in a continuous video format, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will extract the details of the dataset as follows:

1. **Generated Video Dataset**: The authors describe a dataset consisting of 900 images generated in a continuous video format with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. The dataset involves three balls moving in a defined manner, which is crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset or if the dataset is based on existing datasets. However, since this dataset appears to be generated specifically for the experiments described in the paper, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets.

Since the dataset is generated and described in detail within the paper, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Generated Video Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of 900 images in a continuous video format, with a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels. The dataset features three balls that move by a full diameter in a random direction between consecutive frames.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source for the dataset description.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Laurence Aitchison and Stoil Ganev. *InfoNCE is a Variational Autoencoder*. Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset extracted from the research paper, ready for further use or analysis.
