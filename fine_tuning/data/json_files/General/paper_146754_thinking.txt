To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FsPONER: Few-shot Prompt Optimization for Named Entity Recognition in Domain-specific Scenarios" by Yongjian Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on domain-specific NER datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets being used. I will look for any names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three publicly available datasets: 

1. **FabNER**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition in the manufacturing domain, containing over 350,000 examples and focusing on 12 entity types related to manufacturing processes.

2. **Assembly NER**: This dataset consists of 92,000 examples and includes 17 entity types relevant to assembly instructions.

3. **Thin-film Technology Dataset**: This dataset has 22,000 examples and focuses on 9 entity types related to thin-film head technology.

I will also look for a **datasets table** (Table 2) that summarizes the basic information about these datasets, including the number of words and types, which confirms their relevance and details.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **FabNER**:
  > Kumar, A., & Starly, B. (2022). "FabNER": Information extraction from manufacturing process science domain literature using named entity recognition. *Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing*, 33(8), 2393-2407.

- For **Assembly NER**:
  > Costa, C. M., Veiga, G., Sousa, A., & Nunes, S. (2017). Evaluation of Stanford NER for extraction of assembly information from instruction manuals. In *2017 IEEE International Conference on Autonomous Robot Systems and Competitions (ICARSC)* (pp. 302-309).

- For **Thin-film Technology Dataset**:
  > Chen, L., Xu, S., Zhu, L., Zhang, J., Lei, X., & Yang, G. (2020). A deep learning based method for extracting semantic information from patent documents. *Scientometrics*, 125(1), 289-312.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations to ensure proper documentation and attribution.
