To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smooth Mathematical Function from Compact Neural Networks" by I. K. Hong, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research. I will look for any mentions of datasets or data sources that the authors used for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will look for specific sections that might be labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup," where the authors are likely to describe the datasets in detail, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I notice that there are references to **metadatasets** and specific datasets used for training and testing the neural networks. I will pay close attention to any equations or descriptions that define these datasets, as they often provide the necessary context for understanding their structure and purpose.

I will also check the **appendices** for additional information about the datasets. The appendices often contain supplementary material that can provide further insights into the datasets, including how they were generated or any specific parameters used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the necessary information for each one, including:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its purpose in the study.
3. **Full Citation**: I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the complete citation for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset generated from a specific mathematical function, I will note its name, describe its contents (e.g., the variables it includes), and provide the citation as it appears in the references.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.

In summary, my approach will involve:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and appendices for dataset mentions.
2. Documenting the datasets with their names, descriptions, and full citations.
3. Ensuring that all information is accurate and properly attributed to the original sources.
