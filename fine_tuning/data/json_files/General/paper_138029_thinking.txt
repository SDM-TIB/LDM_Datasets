To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Point Transformer" by Alessandro Baiocchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental section)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **ModelNet40 dataset** for point cloud classification tasks. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, structure, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

In section 4.2, the authors describe the **ModelNet40 dataset** as consisting of 12,311 CAD models distributed across 40 object categories. They also mention the official split of the dataset, which allocates 9,843 objects for training and 2,468 for evaluation. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ModelNet40 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wu, S., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, J., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912â€“1920.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for the ModelNet40 dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
