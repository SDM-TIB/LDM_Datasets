To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Action valuation of on- and off-ball soccer players based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning" by Hiroshi Nakahara et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on valuing actions of soccer players, which suggests that data related to player actions and game situations will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.3 (Dataset and preprocessing)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention using data from **54 games in the Meiji J1 League during the 2019 season**, specifically including all 34 games of Yokohama F Marinos. This indicates that the dataset is specific to a professional soccer league and includes detailed tracking and event data.

The authors specify that the dataset includes:
- **Event data**: Labels of actions (e.g., passing and shooting) recorded at 30 Hz, along with the xy coordinates of the ball.
- **Tracking data**: xy coordinates of all players recorded at 25 Hz.
- Additional data such as **season goals** for each player and **ratings by experts**.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or data sources mentioned. In this case, the authors refer to **Data Stadium Inc.** as the provider of the tracking and event data, but they do not provide a formal citation for this dataset.

Since the dataset is proprietary and not publicly available, I will note that in the dataset description. However, I will still include the citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for proper attribution.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper and any relevant details about the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Hiroshi Nakahara, Kazushi Tsutsui, Kazuya Takeda, and Keisuke Fujii. *Action valuation of on- and off-ball soccer players based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics, 2023.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing.
