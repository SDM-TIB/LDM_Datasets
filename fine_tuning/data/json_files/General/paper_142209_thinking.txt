To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIDGET: Music Conditioned 3D Dance Generation" by Jinwu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **AIST++**, which is described as the largest publicly available music-dance dataset. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly state that their proposed method is evaluated on the **AIST++ dataset**, which contains 1,408 3D human dance motion sequences paired with 60 music clips. This confirms that AIST++ is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AIST++ dataset. The citation for the AIST++ dataset is:

> Li, R., Yang, S., Ross, D.A., Kanazawa, A. "AI Choreographer: Music Conditioned 3D Dance Generation with AIST++." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 13401â€“13412, 2021.

Since AIST++ is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
