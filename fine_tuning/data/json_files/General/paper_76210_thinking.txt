To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Free/Data-Sparse Softmax Parameter Estimation with Structured Class Geometries" by Nisar Ahmed, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the **introduction**.

In the introduction, the author discusses the challenges of estimating softmax parameters without labeled training data but does not mention any specific datasets. I will continue to the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that might describe experiments or applications, as these are likely to reference datasets.

Next, I will look for any **examples or case studies** presented in the paper. In section III, titled "Data-Free Softmax Parameter Identification," the author discusses various cases related to softmax parameter synthesis but does not explicitly mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and do not appear to include specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it seems that there are no explicit datasets mentioned for empirical validation or experimentation. The focus is more on theoretical constructs and methodologies rather than on specific datasets.

Since I have not identified any datasets in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would ensure to document them with full citations, following the same process of identifying their names, descriptions, and corresponding references.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in this research paper, and if they had been, I would have provided full citations for each.
