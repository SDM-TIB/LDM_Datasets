To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Salient Positions based Attention Network for Image Classification" by Sheng Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on datasets such as **CIFAR** and **Tiny-ImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **MNIST**, **CIFAR**, and **Tiny-ImageNet** datasets for their experiments. 

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors describe the datasets in more detail:
1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, and it is noted for having a clean background, making it suitable for analyzing observations related to the attention mechanism.
2. **CIFAR Dataset**: This includes both **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, which are widely used datasets for image classification tasks.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet Dataset**: A subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, resized to 64x64 pixels for the experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **Tiny-ImageNet Dataset**:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. FeiFei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR, 2009. Available at: http://www.image-net.org/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
