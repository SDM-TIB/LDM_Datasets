To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Doubly Optimal No-Regret Online Learning in Strongly Monotone Games with Bandit Feedback" by Tianyi Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any datasets mentioned in the context of numerical experiments or application studies. The authors may provide a summary of the datasets, including the number of samples, dimensions, and any relevant statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention datasets like "a9a," "mushrooms," or "news20," I will ensure to find their respective citations. The citations typically include the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
