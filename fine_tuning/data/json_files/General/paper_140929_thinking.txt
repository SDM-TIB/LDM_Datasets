To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Control Barrier Function Composition Approach for Multi-Agent Systems in Marine Applications" by Yujia Yang, Chris Manzie, and Ye Pu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant characteristics. If such a section exists, it will be crucial for gathering detailed information about the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any references to datasets used in simulations or experiments, particularly in sections discussing the **control framework or validation** of the proposed methods. The authors may mention specific datasets that were used to validate their control barrier function framework.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Marine Multi-Agent System Dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note any relevant publications or sources that describe the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the details into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:

1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are clear and concise, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
