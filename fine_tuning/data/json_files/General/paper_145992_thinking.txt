To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP3D-AD: Extending CLIP for 3D Few-Shot Anomaly Detection with Multi-View Images Generation" by Zuo Zuo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method demonstrates competitive performance on the **MVTec-3D AD dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state that their experiments are conducted on the **MVTec-3D AD dataset**. They describe it as the first 3D anomaly detection dataset, providing RGB images and point clouds, and mention the number of training and testing samples. This section confirms that the MVTec-3D AD dataset is indeed used for their experiments.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference the MVTec-3D AD dataset again, providing context about its significance in the field of anomaly detection. This reinforces its importance and relevance to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MVTec-3D AD dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Paul Bergmann, Xin Jin, David Sattlegger, and Carsten Steger. *The MVTec 3D-AD Dataset for Unsupervised 3D Anomaly Detection and Localization*. ArXiv (2021).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **MVTec-3D AD Dataset**: This dataset is the first public 3D industrial anomaly detection dataset, which includes RGB images and point clouds. It consists of 2656 training samples and 1137 testing samples across 10 categories.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing.
