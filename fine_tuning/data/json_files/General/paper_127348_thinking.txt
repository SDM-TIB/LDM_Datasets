To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Connecting the Dots: What Graph-Based Text Representations Work Best for Text Classification using Graph Neural Networks?" by Margarita Bugueño and Gerard de Melo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors compare different graph construction schemes across **five datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **section 3 (Comparing Graph-Based Text Representations)**, where the authors mention the datasets used for their experiments. They list the datasets in a table format, which will provide essential details about each dataset.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **App Reviews**: This dataset consists of English user reviews of Android applications for fine-grained sentiment analysis in an imbalanced setting. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Grano, G., Di Sorbo, A., Mercaldo, F., Visaggio, C. A., Canfora, G., & Panichella, S. (2017). Android apps and user feedback: a dataset for software evolution and quality improvement. In Proceedings of the 2nd ACM SIGSOFT international workshop on app market analytics, pages 8–11.

2. **DBpedia**: This dataset is used for topic classification and consists of Wikipedia articles based on DBpedia 2014 classes. The citation is:
   > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28.

3. **IMDB**: This dataset contains movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database for binary sentiment classification. The citation is:
   > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150.

4. **BBC News**: This dataset consists of English documents from the BBC News website for topic classification. The citation is:
   > Greene, D., & Cunningham, P. (2006). Practical solutions to the problem of diagonal dominance in kernel document clustering. In Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Machine learning, pages 377–384.

5. **Hyperpartisan News Detection (HND)**: This dataset is used for binary news classification and contains news articles labeled for hyperpartisan content. The citation is:
   > Kiesel, J., Mestre, M., Shukla, R., Vincent, E., Adineh, P., Corney, D., Stein, B., & Potthast, M. (2018). Data for pan at semeval 2019 task 4: Hyperpartisan news detection. November. 

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, including the purpose of each dataset and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the citations are complete and correctly formatted for reference.
