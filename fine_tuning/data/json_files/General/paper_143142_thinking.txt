To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tiny Deep Ensemble: Uncertainty Estimation in Edge AI Accelerators via Ensembling Normalization Layers with Shared Weights" by Soyed Tuhin Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on "various benchmark datasets, tasks, and state-of-the-art architectures," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A widely used dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.

3. **UCI Datasets**: The authors mention using 10 different datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for regression tasks. They do not specify the names of these datasets in the experimental setup, so I will need to look for them in the references or other sections of the paper.

4. **Kvasir-SEG Dataset**: This dataset is used for biomedical image segmentation and contains medically obtained gastrointestinal polyp images.

5. **CamVid Dataset**: Used for automotive scene understanding, this dataset consists of road scene images that require pixel-wise segmentation into 12 classes.

6. **Pascal VOC Dataset**: Another dataset mentioned for generalized scene understanding tasks, which involves segmenting images into multiple classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:

  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010.

Next, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and can be utilized effectively.
