To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Disentanglement of Linear-Encoded Facial Semantics" by Yutong Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of StyleGAN and mentions that the authors trained their model on a dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they used two datasets for training their StyleGAN model: **CASIA-WebFace** and **Flickr-Face-HQ (FFHQ)**. This is a crucial finding as it confirms the datasets used in their research.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets. The paper mentions that:

1. **CASIA-WebFace**: This dataset is characterized by low resolution and high pose variation, making it challenging for facial recognition tasks. The authors mention that they roughly align and crop the faces to a resolution of 112x96 pixels.

2. **Flickr-Face-HQ (FFHQ)**: This dataset is noted for its high resolution and environmental variations, primarily consisting of frontal faces. The images are resized to 256x256 pixels for training.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CASIA-WebFace**, the citation is:
  > Dong Yi, Zhen Lei, Shengcai Liao, and Stan Z Li. *Learning Face Representation from Scratch*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.7923, 2014.

- For **Flickr-Face-HQ (FFHQ)**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
