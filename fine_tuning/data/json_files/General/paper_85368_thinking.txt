To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Test on Learnable Image Encryption" by MaungMaung AprilPyone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of learnable image encryption and adversarial robustness but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section III), where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **CIFAR10 dataset** for training their model. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specify that they used the CIFAR10 dataset with a batch size of 128. They also mention that the images in the dataset were in the range of [0, 1] and that they applied live augmentation techniques. This gives me a good understanding of how the dataset was utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the CIFAR10 dataset, including its citation, into the required format.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for CIFAR10, ensuring that it includes the full citation as specified. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
