To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contract Discovery: Dataset and a Few-Shot Semantic Retrieval Challenge with Competitive Baselines" by Łukasz Borchmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the concept of contract discovery and mentions a new dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Contract Discovery: New Dataset and Shared Task)**, where the authors describe the dataset they have created for the contract discovery task. They mention that they collected data from the US EDGAR database and the UK Charity Register, which are crucial sources for the dataset.

In **section 3.2 (Data Collection and Annotation)**, the authors provide details about the types of documents included in the dataset. They specifically mention that they annotated random subsets of bond issue prospectuses, non-disclosure agreements, and annual reports of charitable organizations. This section is essential for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also look for any **statistics or metrics** related to the dataset in section 3.3 (Core Statistics), which provides insights into the number of documents annotated and the types of clauses included. This information is vital for describing the dataset comprehensively.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the sources of their data, which are critical for providing proper citations.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **US EDGAR Database**: This is a publicly available database of financial documents filed by companies. The citation is:
   > U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. *EDGAR - Company Filings*. Retrieved from http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml.

2. **UK Charity Register**: This is a public register of charities in the UK. The citation is:
   > UK Government. *Find Charity Information*. Retrieved from http://www.gov.uk/find-charity-information.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citations for each dataset in the required format.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for the datasets, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for further processing or review.
