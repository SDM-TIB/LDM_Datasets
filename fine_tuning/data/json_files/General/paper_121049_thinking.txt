To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "InPars-Light: Cost-Eﬀective Unsupervised Training of Eﬀicient Rankers" by Leonid Boytsov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the datasets and their significance in the context of the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. This section typically outlines the characteristics of each dataset, including the number of documents, queries, and any specific features relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MS MARCO**: A collection of 8.8 million passages extracted from approximately 3.6 million web documents, accompanied by over half a million question-like queries. The dataset is used for evaluating information retrieval systems.

2. **Robust04**: A smaller collection consisting of about 500,000 news wire documents, with a set of 250 queries that have been densely judged.

3. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: An open-domain question-answering dataset based on Wikipedia, containing approximately 2.6 million passages and 3,400 sparsely judged queries.

4. **TREC COVID**: A corpus of 171,000 scientific articles related to COVID-19, with 50 densely judged queries.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **MS MARCO**:

- **Natural Questions (NQ)**:

- **TREC COVID**:

Hersh. *TREC-COVID: rationale and structure of an information retrieval shared task for COVID-19*. Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 27(9), 2020, 1431–1436.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
