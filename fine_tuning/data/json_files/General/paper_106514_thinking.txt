To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Loss Landscape Dependent Self-Adjusting Learning Rates in Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent" by Wei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on various deep learning models and tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental methodology section** (Section 3) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention evaluating their methods on:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **ImageNet-1K**: A large-scale dataset with 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images, used for image classification tasks.
3. **SWB-300**: A dataset for automatic speech recognition containing approximately 300 hours of training data.
4. **SWB-2000**: Another speech recognition dataset with around 2000 hours of training data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Computer Science Department, University of Toronto, Tech. Rep.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L., Kai Li, & Li Fei-Fei. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 248–255.

- For **SWB-300**:
  > Zhang, W., Cui, X., Finkler, U., Kingsbury, B., Saon, G., Kung, D., & Picheny, M. (2019). Distributed Deep Learning Strategies For Automatic Speech Recognition. In ICASSP’2019.

- For **SWB-2000**:
  > Zhang, W., Cui, X., Finkler, U., Saon, G., Kayi, A., Buyuktosunoglu, A., Kingsbury, B., Kung, D., & Picheny, M. (2019). A Highly Efficient Distributed Deep Learning System For Automatic Speech Recognition. In INTERSPEECH’2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and attributed in any subsequent work or discussions.
