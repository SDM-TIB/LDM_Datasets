To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPAFIT: Stratified Progressive Adaptation Fine-tuning for Pre-trained Large Language Models" by Samir Arora and Liangliang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on tasks from the GLUE benchmark, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their methodology. In this section, they mention using the **GLUE benchmark** for their experiments. I will look for specific tasks within the GLUE benchmark that are referenced in the paper.

In the **Appendix A.1**, the authors provide a detailed description of the GLUE benchmark, which consists of several datasets. I will extract the relevant datasets and their descriptions:

1. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: Contains 10,657 English sentences annotated for grammatical acceptability. The training set includes 8,550 examples.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 215,154 phrases from movie reviews, annotated by human judges. The training set has 67,300 examples.

3. **Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC)**: Contains 5,800 pairs of sentences annotated for paraphrase relationships. The training set includes 3,670 examples.

4. **Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B)**: Comprises 8,628 sentence pairs with human-labeled similarity scores. The training set has 5,749 examples.

5. **Quora Question Pairs (QQP)**: Contains over 400,000 question pairs annotated for paraphrase relationships. The training set includes 364,000 examples.

6. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI)**: A collection of nearly 433,000 sentence pairs annotated for textual entailment. The training set has 393,000 examples.

7. **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (QNLI)**: Based on SQuAD v1.1, it contains over 100,000 question-answer pairs. The training set has 105,000 examples.

8. **Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE)**: Drawn from textual entailment challenges, it contains 2,490 training examples.

9. **Winograd Natural Language Inference (WNLI)**: A small dataset with 635 training examples focused on reading comprehension.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section of the paper:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
