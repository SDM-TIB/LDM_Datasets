To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Sample-Based Training Method for Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction with Pre-Trained Transformers" by Mehrdad Nasser et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach using the **NYT dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **NYT dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including its origin and structure. Specifically, they mention that the NYT dataset was generated by aligning Freebase with the New York Times corpus, with articles from 2005 to 2006 used for training and articles from 2007 for testing. The dataset contains 53 distinct relation types, including a special NA relation, and has 570K sentences in the training set and 170K sentences in the test set.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the NYT dataset is as follows:
> Sebastian Riedel, Limin Yao, and Andrew McCallum. *Modeling relations and their mentions without labeled text*. In Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, pages 148â€“163, 2010.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are accurately represented.
