To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedDAT: An Approach for Foundation Model Finetuning in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Federated Learning" by Haokun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for substantial amounts of data for fine-tuning foundation models and reference various multi-modal tasks. However, I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments and Analyses)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **VizWiz Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a visual question answering dataset specifically designed for blind individuals. The authors mention it in the context of their experiments on the Domain benchmark.

2. **COCO QA Dataset**: This dataset is used for visual question answering and is well-known in the field. The authors indicate its use in their experiments.

3. **Art Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another source for visual question answering tasks, specifically tailored for art-related questions.

4. **GQA Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted for its real-world visual reasoning capabilities and is also used in their experiments.

5. **Abstract Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the visual question answering benchmarks.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **VizWiz Dataset**:
  > Gurari, D., Li, Q., Stangl, A. J., Guo, A., Lin, C., Grauman, K., Luo, J., & Bigham, J. P. (2018). VizWiz Grand Challenge: Answering Visual Questions from Blind People. In CVPR.

- For **COCO QA Dataset**:
  > Ren, M., Kiros, R., & Zemel, R. (2015). Exploring models and data for image question answering. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 28.

- For **Art Dataset**:
  > Garcia, N., Ye, C., Liu, Z., Hu, Q., Otani, M., Chu, C., Nakashima, Y., & Mitamura, T. (2020). A Dataset and Baselines for Visual Question Answering on Art. In Proceedings of the European Conference in Computer Vision Workshops.

- For **GQA Dataset**:
  > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A new dataset for real-world visual reasoning and compositional question answering. In CVPR.

- For **Abstract Dataset**:
  > Antol, S., Agrawal, A., Lu, J., Mitchell, M., Batra, D., Zitnick, C. L., & Parikh, D. (2015). VQA: Visual Question Answering. In ICCV.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
