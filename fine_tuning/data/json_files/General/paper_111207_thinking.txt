To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analyzing Lottery Ticket Hypothesis from PAC-Bayesian Theory Perspective" by Keitaro Sakamoto and Issei Sato, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and empirical analysis sections, where datasets are likely to be discussed in the context of experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons. If the authors mention specific datasets or provide context about their experimental setup, I will note these down.

Next, I will examine the **empirical analysis section** (Section 3) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. I will look for any mentions of datasets used in their experiments, including any specific configurations or characteristics of these datasets.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments. For example, if they mention using CIFAR10 or CIFAR100, I will note the context in which these datasets are used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and for others to locate the datasets.

For instance, if the authors mention using the CIFAR10 dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation for CIFAR10 is typically:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

If they mention any other datasets, I will follow the same process to find their citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset's details.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and empirical analysis sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Note down the names and details of any datasets identified.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a clear and structured format for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
