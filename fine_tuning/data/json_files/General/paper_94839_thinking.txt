To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PGM-Explainer: Probabilistic Graphical Model Explanations for Graph Neural Networks" by Minh N. Vu and My T. Thai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experiment Settings)**, as this section is likely to contain the most relevant information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors state that they used six synthetic datasets for node classification tasks. However, they do not provide specific citations for these datasets since they are generated for the purpose of the experiments.

2. **Bitcoin-Alpha Dataset**: This dataset is described as a trust-weighted signed network containing 3,783 accounts trading Bitcoin. The authors mention that the dataset is used for node classification based on trust ratings.

3. **Bitcoin-OTC Dataset**: Similar to the Bitcoin-Alpha dataset, this dataset contains 5,881 accounts and is also used for node classification based on trust ratings.

4. **MNIST SuperPixel-Graph Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, where each sample corresponds to a graph representation of an image. It is used for graph classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to check the **References section** for any additional details or citations that may be relevant to the datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that full citations are included for each dataset used in the experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
