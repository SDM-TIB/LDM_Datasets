To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparsity-Aware Distributed Learning for Gaussian Processes with Linear Multiple Kernel" by Richard Cornelius Suwandi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on **diverse datasets** and provide specific configurations for the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and dimensions. The authors describe several datasets, including:

1. **ECG Dataset**: Training size of 680, test size of 20, and input dimension of 1.
2. **CO2 Dataset**: Training size of 481, test size of 20, and input dimension of 1.
3. **Unemployment Dataset**: Training size of 380, test size of 20, and input dimension of 1.
4. **ALE Dataset**: Training size of 80, test size of 20, and input dimension of 4.
5. **CCCP Dataset**: Training size of 1000, test size of 250, and input dimension of 4.
6. **Toxicity Dataset**: Training size of 436, test size of 110, and input dimension of 8.
7. **Concrete Dataset**: Training size of 824, test size of 206, and input dimension of 8.
8. **Wine Dataset**: Training size of 1279, test size of 320, and input dimension of 11.
9. **Water Dataset**: Training size of 5000, test size of 100, and input dimension of 11.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. If the datasets are standard datasets commonly used in the field, I will look for their original papers or sources to provide accurate citations.

For example, I will find the citation for the **ECG dataset** and others, ensuring that I include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, sizes, dimensions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future work.
