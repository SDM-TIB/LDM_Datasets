To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Classification with A Deep Network Model based on Compressive Sensing" by Yufei Gan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. This indicates that I should look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss their methodology and the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as having 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, with all images being of size 28x28 pixels. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides specific details about its structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is commonly referenced in literature, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation as per the context of this paper. The typical citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used is the MNIST dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MNIST dataset as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the dataset used in the research.
