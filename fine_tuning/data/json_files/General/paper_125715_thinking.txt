To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bias in Pruned Vision Models: In-Depth Analysis and Countermeasures" by Eugenia Ioﬁnova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the investigation of bias in compressed models, specifically mentioning the use of the **CelebA dataset** for classification tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection that discusses the datasets used. Here, the authors explicitly state that they study properties of sparse residual convolutional neural networks applied to the **CelebA dataset**. They also mention validating findings across other CNN architectures and datasets, including **iWildCam** and **Animals with Attributes2**.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets. They confirm that the **CelebA dataset** is used for training models to predict human-annotated binary attributes. The **iWildCam dataset** is described as a collection of images from wildlife-spotting camera traps, and the **Animals with Attributes2** dataset is noted for its binary attributes related to various animal characteristics.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
