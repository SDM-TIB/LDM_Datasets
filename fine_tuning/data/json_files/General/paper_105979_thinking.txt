To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Moment Transform-Based Compressive Sensing in Image Processing" by Theofanis Kalampokas and George A. Papakostas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses image denoising and compressive sensing but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using five benchmark images: **Lena, Barbara, Baboon, Pirate, and Peppers**. These images are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods under different noise conditions.

I will then check the **conclusions** and **acknowledgments** sections to see if there are any references to datasets or sources for these benchmark images. However, it is common for well-known benchmark images like these to be publicly available and not require specific citations in the paper.

Since the authors do not provide specific citations for these images, I will look for widely accepted references for these benchmark images:

1. **Lena**: 
   > The Lena image is a standard test image in the field of image processing, originally derived from a Playboy magazine photograph. It is widely used in various image processing literature.

2. **Barbara**: 
   > The Barbara image is another commonly used test image in image processing, often cited in literature but does not have a specific citation as it is a standard image.

3. **Baboon**: 
   > The Baboon image is also a well-known benchmark image in image processing, used in various studies without a specific citation.

4. **Pirate**: 
   > The Pirate image is a standard image used in image processing research, similar to the others mentioned.

5. **Peppers**: 
   > The Peppers image is a classic test image in image processing, widely recognized and used in many studies.

Since these images are standard benchmarks, I will note that they are commonly referenced in the field but do not have specific citations in this paper. 

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the common knowledge references for these benchmark images.

In summary, I will create entries for each dataset based on the information gathered, noting that they are widely recognized benchmark images in the field of image processing, but specific citations are not provided in the paper.
