To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diff-CAPTCHA: An Image-based CAPTCHA with Security Enhanced by Denoising Diffusion Model" by Ran Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method)**, where the authors describe the architecture and components of the Diff-CAPTCHA scheme. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the diffusion model and generating CAPTCHA images.

In **section 3.4 (Datasets for training)**, the authors mention that they used a dataset of **724 JPG format images selected from the flower102 dataset** for training the diffusion model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the background images used in the CAPTCHA generation process.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **evaluation section** or **experiments section**. The authors discuss the generation of **10,000 CAPTCHA images** for testing, which is part of the Diff-CAPTCHA scheme. They also mention using a **small-scale commercial YiDun-CAPTCHA dataset** and a **large-scale simulated YiDun-CAPTCHA dataset** as baseline CAPTCHAs for comparison.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Flower102 Dataset**:
   > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the 2008 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-8.

2. **YiDun-CAPTCHA Dataset**:
   > N. Y. team. (2023). *Netease YiDun CAPTCHA*. URL: https://dun.163.com/trial/picture-click, (2023, Jul 16).

3. **Simulated YiDun-CAPTCHA Dataset**:
   > This dataset is programmatically generated and does not have a formal citation, but it is based on the visual effects of the YiDun-CAPTCHA.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
