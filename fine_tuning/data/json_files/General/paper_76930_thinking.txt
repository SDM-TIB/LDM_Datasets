To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trace your sources in large-scale data: one ring to find them all" by Alexander BÃ¶ttcher et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a novel probabilistic BSS framework called DECOMPOSE, which suggests that the authors may have used specific datasets to validate their framework. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly focusing on the **Data** subsection. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention a publicly available two-photon calcium imaging recording of a population of neurons, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

In the **results** section, I will look for any references to datasets used for performance evaluation. The authors describe experiments involving synthetic data and real data, which may lead to additional datasets being mentioned.

I will also check the **references** section to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references other works that may provide the necessary citations for the datasets used. For example, the authors refer to Frady and Kristan Jr (2015) for the two-photon calcium imaging data, which I will need to cite correctly.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset consists of three sources plus background noise, generated for the purpose of testing the DECOMPOSE framework. The details of this dataset are described in the methods section.

2. **Two-Photon Calcium Imaging Data**: This dataset is publicly available and captures the activity of a population of layer 2/3 neurons in the motor cortex of a behaving mouse. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Frady EP, Kristan Jr WB. *The imaging computational microscope*. arXiv preprint arXiv:150207009. 2015.

3. **Augmented Data Sets**: These datasets are based on the experimental data set and involve superimposing ground truth cells onto the original data. The details of this augmentation process are also described in the methods section.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
