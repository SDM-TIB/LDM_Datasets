To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual3D: Efficient and Consistent Text-to-3D Generation with Dual-mode Multi-view Latent Diffusion" by Xinyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel framework for text-to-3D generation but does not specify datasets. I will then check the **experiments section** for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they used the **Objaverse dataset** for training their model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method. I will look for a detailed description of this dataset, including its size, type, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Objaverse dataset. The authors typically provide a citation for datasets they use, which is essential for proper attribution.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the citation for the Objaverse dataset:
> Deitke, M., Schwenk, D., Salvador, J., Weihs, L., Michel, O., VanderBilt, E., Schmidt, L., Ehsani, K., Kembhavi, A., and Farhadi, A. *Objaverse: A universe of annotated 3D objects*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 13142â€“13153, 2023.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Objaverse Dataset**: This dataset is a large-scale collection of annotated 3D objects, which is used for training the Dual3D model. It provides a diverse range of 3D assets that are essential for the text-to-3D generation tasks discussed in the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation for future reference. This will facilitate proper attribution and allow others to access the datasets used in the research.
