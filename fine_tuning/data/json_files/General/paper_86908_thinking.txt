To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Correction for Human Parsing" by Peike Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art performance on two popular single-person human parsing benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **LIP Dataset**: The authors describe it as the largest human parsing dataset, containing 50,462 images with pixel-wise annotations for 19 semantic human part labels. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **PASCAL-Person-Part Dataset**: This dataset is noted to be smaller, containing 1,716 training images and 1,817 validation images, with ground truth labels for six semantic parts.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LIP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xiaodan Liang, Ke Gong, Xiaohui Shen, and Liang Lin. *Look into person: Joint body parsing & pose estimation network and a new benchmark*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence, 41(4):871–885, 2018.

- For the **PASCAL-Person-Part Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xianjie Chen, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Xiaobai Liu, Sanja Fidler, Raquel Urtasun, and Alan Yuille. *Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1971–1978, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
