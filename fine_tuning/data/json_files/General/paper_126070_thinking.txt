To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noise-Resistant Multimodal Transformer for Emotion Recognition" by Yuanyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on several popular multimodal datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors mention four datasets in the **Experiments section**:

1. **MOSI Dataset**: The paper describes it as consisting of 2,199 multimodal sequence samples with video, audio, and text modalities. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MOSEI Dataset**: This dataset comprises 22,851 video clips collected from YouTube, with spontaneous expressions and various scenarios. It is also divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **IEMOCAP Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset includes video, audio, and text transcriptions, with a total of 10,039 samples across five sessions.

4. **RML Dataset**: This dataset is described as an audio-visual emotion dataset containing 720 video samples across six different languages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MOSI Dataset**:

- For the **MOSEI Dataset**:

- For the **IEMOCAP Dataset**:

- For the **RML Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
