To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdaL: Adaptive Gradient Transformation Contributes to Convergences and Generalizations" by Hongwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of AdaL on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a table (Table 1) that outlines the models used for the experiments, specifically mentioning that they evaluated AdaL on image classification tasks using deep convolutional networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. This confirms the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. 

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
