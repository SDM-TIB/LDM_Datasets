To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image-based CLIP-Guided Essence Transfer" by Hila Chefer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the text, along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the abstract.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. Here, the authors mention using a dataset of 200 random images from the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for fine-tuning their encoder, and they also evaluate their methods on a set of 68 images inverted with the **e4e encoder**. 

I will also look for any references to datasets in the **methodology** sections, particularly where they describe their experimental setup. The authors mention that they used the **CelebA-HQ dataset** for training and testing their methods, which is crucial information.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The CelebA-HQ dataset is referenced, and I will extract its citation:

- For **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Additionally, I will note that the authors used images inverted with the **e4e encoder**, but since this is not a dataset per se, I will not include it in the dataset list.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
