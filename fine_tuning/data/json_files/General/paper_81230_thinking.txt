To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Adaptive Brovey as a New Method for Image Fusion" by Hamid Reza Shahdoosti, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed fusion method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experimental results section** where the author mentions using "Four-band multispectral QuickBird data" for the experiments. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized, which I need to describe further.

I will then look for additional details about the **QuickBird dataset** in the paper. The author states that the images were acquired by the QuickBird satellite over the Pyramid area of Egypt in 2002. This provides me with essential information about the dataset's origin and context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the QuickBird dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific reference for the QuickBird dataset itself, as it is a well-known satellite imagery source. Therefore, I will use the following citation based on common knowledge about the QuickBird satellite:

- For **QuickBird Dataset**, the citation is:
  > DigitalGlobe. "QuickBird Satellite Imagery." Available at: https://www.digitalglobe.com/.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

In summary, I have identified the **QuickBird dataset** as the primary dataset used in the research, and I have noted its details and citation. I will now prepare the dataset entry accordingly.
