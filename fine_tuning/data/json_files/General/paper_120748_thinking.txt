To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligning true and predicted segments" by Maarten Marx, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and empirical evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset mentions.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the Panoptic Quality (PQ) metric and its applications, but does not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the **empirical evaluation section** where the author describes experiments conducted using a page stream segmentation system based on a BERT transformer model.

In this section, the author mentions a dataset used for training and testing the segmentation model. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Page Stream Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset consists of 76 streams having 17,834 segments over 63,815 pages, which was used to train the segmentation model. The evaluation was conducted on a dataset of 34 streams with 6,347 segments over 25,000 pages.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset used in the experiments is:

- For the **Page Stream Segmentation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abhijit Guha, Abdulrahman Alahmadi, Debabrata Samanta, Mohammad Zubair Khan, and Ahmed H Alahmadi. *A Multi-Modal Approach to Digital Document Stream Segmentation for Title Insurance Domain*. IEEE Access, 10: 11341â€“11353, 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset from the paper:
- **Page Stream Segmentation Dataset**: Used for training and testing a segmentation model, consisting of 76 streams with 17,834 segments over 63,815 pages, and evaluated on 34 streams with 6,347 segments over 25,000 pages.

I will ensure that the full citation is included in any final output to maintain proper attribution.
