To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Med-Query: Steerable Parsing of 9-DoF Medical Anatomies with Query Embedding" by Heng Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validated their method on three medical imaging parsing tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **"Datasets."** Here, the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will identify the datasets mentioned and take note of their characteristics.

From the text, I find the following datasets:

1. **RibInst Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from a public CT dataset used for rib fracture evaluation. It consists of 654 CT scans with annotated ribs for instance-level segmentation.

2. **CTSpine1K Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,005 CT scans with instance-level vertebra annotations, curated from multiple sources for spine analysis tasks.

3. **FLARE22 Dataset**: This dataset is part of a challenge for abdominal organ segmentation, containing labeled and unlabeled CT scans for various organs.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I find are:

- For **RibInst Dataset**:
  > Jin, L., Yang, J., Kuang, K., Ni, B., Gao, Y., Sun, Y., Gao, P., Ma, W., Tan, M., Kang, H., Chen, J., & Li, M. (2020). Deep-learning-assisted detection and segmentation of rib fractures from CT scans: Development and validation of FracNet. *EBioMedicine*, 2020.

- For **CTSpine1K Dataset**:
  > Liu, P., Deng, Y., Wang, C., Hui, Q., Li, J., Li, S., Luo, M., Sun, M., Quan, Q., Yang, S., et al. (2021). CTSpine1K: A large-scale dataset for spinal vertebrae segmentation in computed tomography. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.14711*.

- For **FLARE22 Dataset**:
  > FLARE22 Challenge. (2022). Fast and Low-resource semi-supervised Abdominal organ segmentation in CT. Retrieved from https://flare22.grand-challenge.org.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
