To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gravity-Inspired Graph Autoencoders for Directed Link Prediction" by Guillaume Salha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three different directed link prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental analysis section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Three Directed Link Prediction Tasks)**. Here, the authors outline the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three publicly available real-world directed graphs: **Cora**, **Citeseer**, and **Google**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, and any other relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, which includes:
- **Cora**: 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 2.86% reciprocity.
- **Citeseer**: 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 1.20% reciprocity.
- **Google**: 15,763 nodes, 171,206 edges, 14.55% reciprocity.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:
- For **Cora** and **Citeseer**, they are citation graphs consisting of scientific publications. The datasets can be found at the following links:
  > Cora: https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data  
  > Citeseer: https://linqs.soe.ucsc.edu/data

- For **Google**, the dataset is a web graph, and it can be accessed here:
  > Google: http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/cfinder-google

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations and relevant details for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
