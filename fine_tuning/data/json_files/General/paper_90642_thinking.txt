To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SESAME: Semantic Editing of Scenes by Adding, Manipulating or Erasing Objects" by Evangelos Ntavelis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a diverse set of datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: This dataset contains 3,000 street-level view images from 50 different cities in Europe, with fine-grained per-pixel semantics and instance segmentation. The original resolution is 2048Ã—1024 pixels, and it is used for both addition and removal tasks.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset includes over 20,000 images with detailed semantics for 150 different classes, along with an additional 2,000 images for validation. The authors use a subset of bedroom scenes for manipulation tasks.

3. **Flickr-Landscapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200,000 images scraped from Flickr, focusing on landscapes. After processing, it contains 7,367 training and 500 validation images with segmentation for 17 different semantic classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Cordts, M., Omran, M., Ramos, S., Rehfeld, T., Enzweiler, M., Benenson, R., Franke, U., Roth, S., & Schiele, B. (2016). *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For **Flickr-Landscapes**, the citation is:
  > The dataset was created by scraping images from Flickr with a landscape constraint, as mentioned in the paper, but a specific citation is not provided. I will note that it is based on the work of the authors and their methodology.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary details for downstream processing.
