To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature for Modern Neural Network Architectures" by Runa Eschenhagen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Collection."

In section 4.2, the authors mention using the **ogbg-molpcba dataset** for training a graph neural network. This dataset is described as being used for molecular property prediction, which provides context for its application.

In section 4.3, the authors refer to the **ImageNet dataset** for training a vision transformer. This dataset is well-known in the field of computer vision and is used for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ogbg-molpcba dataset**, the citation is:
> Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., and Leskovec, J. *Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs*. In NeurIPS, 2020.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. IJCV, 115, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.
