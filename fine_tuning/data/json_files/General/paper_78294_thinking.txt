To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning with Confident Examples: Rank Pruning for Robust Classification with Noisy Labels" by Curtis G. Northcutt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed Rank Pruning method on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on both **MNIST** and **CIFAR** datasets, which confirms their relevance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The dataset is commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for evaluating machine learning algorithms in image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. 2009.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
