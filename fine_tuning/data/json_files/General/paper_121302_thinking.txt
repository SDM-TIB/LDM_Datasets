To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EENET: Learning to Early Exit for Adaptive Inference" by Fatih Ilhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on five benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the authors explicitly mention using three image datasets and two NLP datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training and 10,000 test images with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, categorized into 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset has 50,000 training and 10,000 test images but is divided into 100 classes.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1.2 million training images and 150,000 validation images, categorized into 1,000 classes.
4. **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset containing 67,349 training, 872 validation, and 1,821 test sentences with binary labels (positive or negative).
5. **AGNews**: This dataset consists of 120,000 training and 7,600 test sentences across four classes.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. Based on the information provided in the paper, I can compile the following citations:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 248–255, 2009. doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848.

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*.

URL https://aclanthology.org/D13-1170.

- For **AGNews**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-Level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 28. Curran Associates, Inc., 2015. URL https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/250cf8b51c773f3f8dc8b4be867a9a02-Paper.pdf.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references for future use or verification.
