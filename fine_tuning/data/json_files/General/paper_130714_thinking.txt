To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatGPT-based Investment Portfolio Selection" by Oleksandr Romanko, Akhilesh Narayan, and Roy H. Kwon, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract indicates that the authors used ChatGPT to generate stock selections from the S&P 500 index, which suggests that the S&P 500 itself is a key dataset.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** sections, particularly where the authors describe their approach to generating trading universes and portfolio optimization. In section 2, titled "GPT-4 Selection of Trading Universe of Stocks," the authors mention that they used the GPT-4 model to create trading universes of stocks from the S&P 500. This indicates that the S&P 500 dataset is central to their analysis.

In section 3, titled "Portfolio Optimization Models and Computational Tests," the authors specify that they utilized historical financial data for five years prior to September 2021 for their optimization formulations. This historical data is crucial for their analysis and should be documented.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results** and **conclusions** sections, where the authors may discuss the performance of their portfolios in relation to benchmarks like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite indices. These indices are also important datasets for comparison purposes.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their full citations:

1. **S&P 500 Index**: The authors used the S&P 500 as the primary dataset for stock selection and portfolio construction. The S&P 500 is a well-known stock market index that includes 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S.

   Citation:
   > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

2. **Historical Financial Data**: The authors utilized historical weekly data for five years prior to September 2021 for their portfolio optimization models. This data was sourced from Yahoo Finance, which provides comprehensive historical stock price data.

   Citation:
   > Yahoo Finance. *Historical Stock Price Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

3. **Dow Jones Industrial Average**: This index was used as a benchmark for comparing portfolio performance.

   Citation:
   > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *Dow Jones Industrial Average*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/dow-jones-industrial-average/

4. **Nasdaq Composite Index**: Another benchmark used for performance comparison in the study.

   Citation:
   > Nasdaq. *Nasdaq Composite Index*. Available at: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/quotes/nasdaq-comp

5. **Popular Investment Funds**: The authors compared their portfolios against several well-known investment funds, which represent a broader market performance.

   Citation:
   > Various sources for individual funds, including Vanguard and Fidelity websites.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation for future reference. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the datasets used in the research paper.
