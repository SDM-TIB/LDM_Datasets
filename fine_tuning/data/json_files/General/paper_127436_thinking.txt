To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Contradictory Hallucinations of LLMs: Evaluation, Detection and Mitigation" by Niels MÃ¼ndler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of various instruction-tuned LMs, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their evaluation setup. Here, they mention a primary test set called **MainTestSet**, which consists of 360 descriptions spanning four different language models and 30 diverse entities. This indicates that MainTestSet is a significant dataset used in their evaluation.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **appendices**. The authors reference the **PopQA benchmark** in Section 6.3, which is used for question answering tasks. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **MainTestSet**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it appears to be constructed from their own experiments. However, they mention that it includes entities from Wikipedia and other sources, which may not have a formal citation.

2. **PopQA benchmark**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Mallen, A., Asai, A., Zhong, V., Das, R., Khashabi, D., & Hajishirzi, H. (2023). *When not to trust language models: Investigating effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric memories*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2023. URL: https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2023.acl-long.546.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the PopQA benchmark and note the MainTestSet as a self-constructed dataset without a formal citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
