To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarially Learned Inference" by Vincent Dumoulin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors achieved competitive performance on the **SVHN** and **CIFAR10** tasks, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In section 4, they explicitly mention using four datasets: **SVHN**, **CIFAR10**, **CelebA**, and a downsampled version of **ImageNet**. I will note the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

1. **SVHN Dataset**: The authors reference the original paper that introduced the dataset, which is a collection of images of house numbers. The citation is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS workshop on deep learning and unsupervised feature learning, volume 2011, pp. 4. Granada, Spain, 2011.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*, 2009.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images, each with 40 attribute labels. The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 3730–3738, 2015.

4. **ImageNet Dataset**: The authors mention using a downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset, which is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
