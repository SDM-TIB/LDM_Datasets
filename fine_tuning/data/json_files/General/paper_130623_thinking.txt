To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AspectMMKG: A Multi-modal Knowledge Graph with Aspect-aware Entities" by Jingdan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions that AspectMMKG contains **2,380 entities, 18,139 entity aspects, and 645,383 aspect-related images**, which indicates that these are key datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data Construction)**, where the authors describe the methodology for constructing AspectMMKG. Here, they detail the process of collecting entities and aspect-related images, which confirms that the dataset is derived from both Wikipedia and an online image search engine.

In **subsection 2.1 (Entity Collection)**, the authors specify that they extracted **2,380 popular entities** from predefined entity types using SPARQL queries on Wikidata. This is a crucial dataset that I need to document.

In **subsection 2.3 (Aspect-related Image Collection)**, they explain how they collected **aspect-related images** from both Wikipedia and Google, resulting in **645,383 aspect-related images**. This is another important dataset that needs to be included.

Additionally, in **section 3 (Downstream Performance)**, the authors mention using the **eal-dataset-2020** for their experiments, which is a dataset relevant to the entity aspect linking task. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **AspectMMKG dataset**, the citation is:
   > Jingdan Zhang, Jiaan Wang, Xiaodan Wang, Zhixu Li, and Yanghua Xiao. 2023. AspectMMKG: A Multi-modal Knowledge Graph with Aspect-aware Entities. In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM ’23), October 21–25, 2023, Birmingham, United Kingdom. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 10 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3583780.3614782

2. For the **eal-dataset-2020**, the citation is:
   > Jordan S. Ramsdell and Laura Dietz. 2020. A Large Test Collection for Entity Aspect Linking. Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management (2020).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets along with their full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
