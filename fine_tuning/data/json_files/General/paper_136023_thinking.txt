To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmentation-Free Dense Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Semantic Segmentation" by Jiawei Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted extensive experiments on five mainstream benchmarks. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Setups)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five datasets:

1. **Cityscapes**: A dataset for real-world semantic urban scene understanding, containing 5,000 image samples with high-quality pixel-level annotations.
2. **Pascal VOC**: A competition dataset with 21 categories, consisting of 10,582 training samples.
3. **CamVid**: A dataset with over 700 samples and pixel-level labels for 11 semantic classes.
4. **ADE20K**: A popular dataset with around 25,000 images and 150 categories.
5. **COCO-Stuff-164K**: An augmented dataset from MS COCO 2017 with pixel-level annotations, containing 172 classes.

I will then verify the details of each dataset mentioned in the paper to ensure accuracy.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- **Cityscapes**:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*.

- **Pascal VOC**:

  > Gabriel J Brostow, Jamie Shotton, Julien Fauqueur, and Roberto Cipolla. *Segmentation and recognition using structure from motion point clouds*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2008.

- **ADE20K**:

- **COCO-Stuff-164K**:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted information effectively for further processing or review.
