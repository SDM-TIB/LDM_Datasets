To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Online Algorithm for Contrastive Principal Component Analysis" by Siavash Golkar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of the proposed method on real datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their comparisons and evaluations. In **Section 4.1**, they mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Noisy Digits Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,000 synthetic images generated by superimposing images of handwritten digits (0 and 1) from the MNIST dataset onto natural images from the UPenn Natural Image Database. The negative samples are natural images.

2. **Mouse Dataset**: This dataset includes protein expression measurements of mice that have undergone shock therapy, with some developing Down Syndrome. The negative samples consist of protein expression measurements from mice that have not been exposed to shock therapy.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citations are:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, “The MNIST database of handwritten digits,” http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For the **UPenn Natural Image Database**, the citation is:
  > Gašper Tkačik et al., “Natural images from the birthplace of the human eye,” PLOS One, vol. 6, no. 6, pp. e20409, 2011.

- For the **Mouse Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Clara Higuera et al., “Self-organizing feature maps identify proteins critical to learning in a mouse model of down syndrome,” PLOS One, vol. 10, no. 6, pp. e0129126, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
