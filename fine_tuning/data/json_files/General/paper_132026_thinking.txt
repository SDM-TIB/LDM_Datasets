To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Decoding Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Sean Oâ€™Brien and Mike Lewis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors evaluate their method on various reasoning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention several datasets for different tasks, including:

1. **GSM8K**: A widely used benchmark consisting of grade-school word math problems.
2. **HellaSwag**: A commonsense reasoning benchmark.
3. **AQuA**: A dataset for algebraic word problems.
4. **ASDiv**: Another dataset for algebraic word problems.
5. **SVAMP**: A dataset for evaluating math word problem solvers.
6. **MATH**: A larger and more challenging benchmark for math problems.
7. **CommonsenseQA**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.
8. **StrategyQA**: Another commonsense reasoning dataset.
9. **AI2 Reasoning Challenge**: A dataset for multiple-choice reasoning tasks.
10. **BoolQ**: A dataset for yes/no questions.
11. **MMLU**: A benchmark for measuring massive multitask language understanding.
12. **PIQA**: A dataset for reasoning about physical commonsense.
13. **SIQA**: A dataset for social interaction reasoning.
14. **WinoGrande**: A large-scale adversarial Winograd schema challenge.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will extract include:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
