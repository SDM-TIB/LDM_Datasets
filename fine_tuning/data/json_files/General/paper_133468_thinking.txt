To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TRIGO: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Proof Reduction for Generative Language Models" by Jing Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new benchmark called **TRIGO**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (TRIGO Dataset)**, where the authors detail how they constructed the TRIGO dataset. They mention collecting trigonometric expression reduction problems from various sources, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

In **subsection 4.1 (Problem Collection)**, the authors specify two datasets:
1. **TRIGO-real**: This dataset consists of 427 problems collected from high school exercises and exams, with a total of 10,574 proof tactics.
2. **TRIGO-web**: This dataset includes an additional 453 samples collected from various websites, used as a test set.

The authors also mention the generation of additional datasets:
3. **TRIGO-gen**: This dataset is automatically generated and consists of samples created by applying predefined rules to generate problems of varying difficulty. It includes three subsets based on the number of rules applied (TG-1, TG-2, TG-3).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are newly created by the authors, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will document the datasets as follows:

- For **TRIGO-real**, the citation is:
  > Jing Xiong, Jianhao Shen, Ye Yuan, Haiming Wang, Yichun Yin, Zhengying Liu, Lin Li, Zhijiang Guo, Qingxing Cao, Yinya Huang, Chuanyang Zheng, Xiaodan Liang, Ming Zhang, Qun Liu. *TRIGO: Benchmarking Formal Mathematical Proof Reduction for Generative Language Models*. In Proceedings of [Conference Name], [Year].

- For **TRIGO-web**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same work.

- For **TRIGO-gen**, the citation is also the same as above.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the citations are formatted correctly and that the dataset descriptions are clear and concise, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.
