To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChebMixer: Efficient Graph Representation Learning with MLP Mixer" by Xiaoyan Kui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section 4, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets:

1. **Cora**: A widely used dataset for graph node classification.
2. **Citeseer**: Another popular dataset for graph-based learning tasks.
3. **Pubmed**: A dataset that contains scientific publications for citation networks.
4. **Computers**: A dataset used for graph node classification.
5. **Photo**: Similar to Computers, this dataset is also used for classification tasks.
6. **CoauthorCS**: A dataset for co-authorship networks in computer science.
7. **ogbn-arxiv**: A large-scale dataset from the Open Graph Benchmark for graph learning tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2017.

- For **Citeseer**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Wang, J., & Yang, J. *Collective classification in network data*. In Proceedings of the 2008 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, 2008.

- For **Pubmed**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Y., & Leskovec, J. *Patterns of temporal variation in online media*. In Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2011.

- For **Computers**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

- For **Photo**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

- For **CoauthorCS**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

- For **ogbn-arxiv**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., et al. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced accurately in future work.
