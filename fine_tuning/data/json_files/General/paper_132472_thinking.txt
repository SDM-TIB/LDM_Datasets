To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards a Neuronally Consistent Ontology for Robotic Agents" by Florian Ahrens et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of **fMRI data** collected from participants, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **experimental design and annotation** subsection. Here, the authors describe the use of **ten 1st-person videos** recorded via a head-mounted camera, which serve as the stimulus material for the fMRI study. This indicates that the videos themselves may constitute a dataset.

In the **participants and data acquisition section**, the authors mention that **thirty participants** were recruited for the study. This demographic information is important for understanding the dataset's context but does not constitute a dataset itself.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets or data types that may have been analyzed, such as the **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** results, which are derived from the fMRI data. However, these results are typically not standalone datasets but rather analyses of the previously mentioned fMRI data.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets identified:

1. **fMRI Dataset**: This dataset consists of the fMRI data collected from participants while they viewed the 1st-person videos. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is derived from the study conducted by Ahrens in 2021.

2. **Video Dataset**: The dataset includes ten 1st-person videos depicting table-setting activities. These videos are crucial for the fMRI study as they serve as the stimuli for the participants. The authors do not provide a formal citation for these videos, but they are part of the experimental setup.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. The only relevant citation I can find is for the fMRI study:

- For the **fMRI study**, the citation is:
  > Florian Ahrens, Neuronal Dynamics of Everyday Activities and their Implications for Robot Control â€“ an fMRI Study, PhD Thesis, University of Bremen, 2021.

Since the videos are part of the experimental design and do not have a separate citation, I will note that they are part of the study's methodology.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

- **Dataset 1**: fMRI Dataset (derived from Ahrens 2021)
- **Dataset 2**: Video Dataset (not formally cited, part of the experimental design)

With this information, I can now prepare to format the datasets according to the required structure, ensuring that the citations are included where applicable.
