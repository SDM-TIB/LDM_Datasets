To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Argument Component Classification for Classroom Discussions" by Luca Lugini and Diane Litman, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the focus on classifying student utterances in classroom discussions, which suggests that there is a dataset involved. The introduction provides context about the educational domain and hints at the unique nature of the dataset being used.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they collected **73 transcripts of text-based classroom discussions** centered on English Language Arts (ELA) for high school classes. This section provides critical information about the dataset, including its composition and the method of data collection.

The authors detail that the dataset consists of a mix of small group and whole class discussions, with specific demographic information about the schools involved. They also explain the process of annotating the data for argument components and specificity, which is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will note the key characteristics of the dataset:
- **Number of transcripts**: 73
- **Type of discussions**: Text-based classroom discussions
- **Educational context**: English Language Arts (ELA) for high school
- **Unit of analysis**: Argument moves consisting of argumentative discourse units (ADUs)
- **Annotation scheme**: Based on the Toulmin model, including claims, evidence, and warrants.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the dataset. The authors reference their own previous work for the annotation scheme, which is crucial for citing the dataset accurately.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Lugini, L., & Litman, D. (2018). Annotating student talk in text-based classroom discussions. In Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 110â€“116.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.
