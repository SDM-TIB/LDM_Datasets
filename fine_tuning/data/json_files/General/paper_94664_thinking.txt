To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces and Machine Learning for Wireless Fingerprinting Localization" by Cam Ly Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the generation of radio maps for wireless fingerprinting localization, which suggests that there may be datasets related to radio signal measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **background and related works section** to identify any existing datasets that the authors might have used or referenced. This section often provides context and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to the study.

In the **system model and problem statement section**, the authors describe the process of generating radio maps and the parameters involved. I will look for any mention of specific datasets used for training or validation purposes.

Moving to the **radio map generation section**, I will pay close attention to any details about the datasets used to create the radio maps. The authors may describe the parameters of the datasets, such as the number of configurations or the locations sampled.

In the **performance evaluation and simulations section**, the authors may provide insights into the datasets used for simulations, including the number of locations and configurations. This is crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the key characteristics of each dataset, such as its purpose, size, and any relevant details about its use in the research.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, complete with proper citations.
