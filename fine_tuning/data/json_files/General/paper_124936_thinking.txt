To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Training a Two Layer ReLU Network Analytically" by Adrian Barbu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on "four out of the five real datasets evaluated," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.4 (Datasets Used)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Abalone Dataset**: This dataset is described as being about predicting the age of abalone from its physical measurements, containing 4,177 observations and 7 features.

2. **Bike-sharing Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting hourly bike rental counts, with 17,379 observations and 13 features.

3. **Year Prediction MSD Dataset**: This dataset is about predicting the release year of a song from audio features, containing 515,345 observations and 90 features.

4. **SDF Decoder Dataset**: This dataset is generated for a shape decoder task, with 73,080 observations and 2 features.

5. **Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 15,912 observations, with 225 inputs and 225 outputs, derived from image patches.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository for the Abalone, Bike-sharing, and Year Prediction MSD datasets, which I will note accordingly. The SDF decoder dataset is based on the work by Park et al. (2019), and the DAE dataset is derived from the Berkeley dataset (Martin et al., 2001).

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Abalone Dataset**:
  > Dua, D.; Graff, C. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2017.

- **Bike-sharing Dataset**:
  > Dua, D.; Graff, C. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2017.

- **Year Prediction MSD Dataset**:
  > Dua, D.; Graff, C. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 2017.

- **SDF Decoder Dataset**:
  > Park, J.J.; Florence, P.; Straub, J.; Newcombe, R.; Lovegrove, S. *Deepsdf: Learning continuous signed distance functions for shape representation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019, pp. 165–174.

- **Denoising Autoencoder Dataset**:
  > Martin, D.; Fowlkes, C.; Tal, D.; Malik, J. *A Database of Human Segmented Natural Images and its Application to Evaluating Segmentation Algorithms and Measuring Ecological Statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001, Vol. 2, pp. 416–423.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
