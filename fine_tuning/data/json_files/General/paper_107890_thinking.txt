To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DropNAS: Grouped Operation Dropout for Differentiable Architecture Search" by Weijun Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for benchmarking.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Benchmark)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with a resolution of 32x32 pixels, divided into 10 categories.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it is divided into 100 categories.
3. **ImageNet**: A larger dataset with 1.3 million training images and 50,000 testing images, distributed across 1,000 classes, with images resized to 224x224 pixels for evaluation.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are typically not included in the references, but I can provide general citations based on common knowledge:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all necessary information for downstream processing or review.
