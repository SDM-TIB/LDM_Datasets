To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Mobile GUI: from Pixel-Words to Screen-Sentences" by Jingwen Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a dataset called **RICO-PW**, which is based on the public **RICO dataset**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used in the study. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **RICO-PW**: This dataset is built upon the public RICO dataset and includes screenshots with Pixel-Words annotations. It is specifically designed to address the lack of high-quality training data for GUI understanding.

2. **P2S-UI**: This is a dataset collected by the authors, containing 27,077 mobile UI images, with 5,556 images annotated with Pixel-Words, as well as annotations for relation, clickability, and app type for each screenshot.

3. **RICO-ICON**: This dataset consists of 120,067 icons cropped from the RICO dataset, categorized into 32 categories.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **RICO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Biplab Deka, Zifeng Huang, Chad Franzen, Joshua Hibschman, Daniel Afergan, Yang Li, Jeffrey Nichols, and Ranjitha Kumar. *Rico: A mobile app dataset for building data-driven design applications*. In Proceedings of the 30th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST 2017).

- The **RICO-PW** dataset is a new dataset created by the authors based on the RICO dataset, so it does not have a separate citation but is referenced as an extension of the RICO dataset.

- For **P2S-UI**, since it is a dataset collected by the authors, it does not have a separate citation in the references but is described in the paper.

- For **RICO-ICON**, it is also derived from the RICO dataset, and thus does not have a separate citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations:

1. **RICO-PW**: Built on the RICO dataset, includes Pixel-Words annotations.
   - Citation: Based on the RICO dataset.

2. **P2S-UI**: A dataset collected by the authors with annotations for various tasks.
   - Citation: Not separately cited.

3. **RICO-ICON**: A dataset of icons derived from the RICO dataset.
   - Citation: Based on the RICO dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
