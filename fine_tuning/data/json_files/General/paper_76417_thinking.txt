To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Convolutional Networks with Web Images" by Nizar Massouh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data download sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the goal of building large-scale databases from web images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **Chapter 3 (Data Download)**, where the author outlines the process of collecting data. In this chapter, the author mentions the **ImageNet** dataset explicitly, describing it as a large-scale image database containing up to 14 million images structured into approximately 21,000 categories. This is a significant dataset for the research.

In **section 3.5 (Collected Data)**, the author provides a detailed table summarizing the various databases collected during the research. The table includes several datasets, such as:

1. **Controlled Query**: This dataset focuses on high-quality images collected using a semi-supervised query expansion method. It contains a significant number of images, but the exact count is not specified in the text.

2. **Controlled Download**: This dataset consists of images chosen from the first returned results of search engines, emphasizing relevance and quality.

3. **Random Split**: This dataset is collected without any query expansion methods, focusing on obtaining as many images as possible.

4. **Controlled Split**: This dataset is based on images returned from the first result pages, assuming that relevance decreases with deeper search results.

I will also check the **Bibliography section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The most notable dataset is **ImageNet**, which is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. The citation for ImageNet is:

- For **ImageNet**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
