To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning for Prawn Farming: Forecasting and Anomaly Detection" by Joel Janek Dabrowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on forecasting and anomaly detection in water quality parameters, which suggests that data from sensors is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Dataset, Preprocessing, and Evaluation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe the dataset acquired from sensors placed in several ponds on an Australian prawn farm. They mention that the dataset covers the period from September 30, 2018, to April 19, 2020, and includes data sampled at 15-minute intervals.

The authors specify that the dataset used for testing the forecasting models contains 27,553 samples for training and 1,450 samples for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and size.

I will also look for any specific references to the dataset's source or any related publications that provide a full citation. In this case, the dataset is derived from the authors' own sensor deployment, so I will note that it does not have a traditional citation but is instead a proprietary dataset collected by the authors.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Prawn Farming Water Quality Dataset**: This dataset consists of water quality parameters collected from sensors deployed in prawn ponds over two grow-out seasons. It includes measurements of dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll, and water temperature, sampled at 15-minute intervals. The dataset contains 27,553 training samples and 1,450 testing samples.

Since this dataset is not published in a traditional sense, I will note that the dataset is proprietary to the authors and provide the citation for the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the paper is:
> Joel Janek Dabrowski, Ashfaqur Rahman, Andrew Hellicar, Mashud Rana, and Stuart Arnold. *Deep Learning for Prawn Farming: Forecasting and Anomaly Detection*. In Proceedings of the 24th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
