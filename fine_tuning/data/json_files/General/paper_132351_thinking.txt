To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LAPP: Layer Adaptive Progressive Pruning for Compressing CNNs from Scratch" by Pucheng Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the method demonstrates superior performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on two popular image classification datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. I will note these datasets and look for specific details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of classes, number of images, and any preprocessing steps mentioned. For instance, the CIFAR-10 dataset is described as containing 60,000 color images across 10 classes, while ImageNet is noted for having approximately 1.28 million training images from 1,000 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Master’s thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky et al., “ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,” International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, 2015.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
