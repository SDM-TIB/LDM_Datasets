To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Style-Based Global Appearance Flow for Virtual Try-On" by Sen He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a "popular virtual try-on benchmark," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they state that they experimented with the **VITON dataset**, which is described as containing 14,221 image pairs for training and 2,032 pairs for testing, with both person and garment images at a resolution of 256 × 192.

I will also note that they created an additional dataset called **augmented VITON** to evaluate the model's robustness against misalignments. This dataset was generated by randomly augmenting the testing person images from the original VITON dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VITON dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Xintong Han, Zuxuan Wu, Zhe Wu, Ruichi Yu, and Larry S. Davis. *VITON: An Image-Based Virtual Try-On Network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Since the augmented VITON dataset is derived from the original VITON dataset, I will cite the same reference for it.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **VITON Dataset**: Contains 14,221 training image pairs and 2,032 testing image pairs, with a resolution of 256 × 192.
   - Citation: Xintong Han, Zuxuan Wu, Zhe Wu, Ruichi Yu, and Larry S. Davis. *VITON: An Image-Based Virtual Try-On Network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

2. **Augmented VITON Dataset**: Created by augmenting the testing person images in the original VITON dataset to evaluate robustness against misalignments.
   - Citation: Xintong Han, Zuxuan Wu, Zhe Wu, Ruichi Yu, and Larry S. Davis. *VITON: An Image-Based Virtual Try-On Network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
