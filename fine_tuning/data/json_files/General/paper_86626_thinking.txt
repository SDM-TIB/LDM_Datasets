To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BiPaR: A Bilingual Parallel Dataset for Multilingual and Cross-lingual Reading Comprehension on Novels" by Yimin Jing, Deyi Xiong, and Yan Zhen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces BiPaR as a bilingual parallel dataset and mentions the number of bilingual parallel paragraphs and question-answer pairs created. This indicates that BiPaR is the primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the dataset is discussed in detail in **section 3 (Dataset Creation)**, where the authors describe the process of collecting bilingual parallel passages and creating question-answer pairs. They mention that they collected 3,667 bilingual parallel passages and constructed 14,668 question-answer pairs.

I will also check the **tables** and **figures** for any additional information about the dataset. For instance, **Table 1** compares BiPaR with existing datasets, which provides context about its unique features. 

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the full citation for the BiPaR dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Yimin Jing, Deyi Xiong, and Yan Zhen. *BiPaR: A Bilingual Parallel Dataset for Multilingual and Cross-lingual Reading Comprehension on Novels*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year]. [Additional details if available].

Finally, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, size, and unique characteristics, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the dataset as described in the paper.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I have thoroughly extracted and documented the dataset information from the paper.
