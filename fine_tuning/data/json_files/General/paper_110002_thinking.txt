To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modality Associative Bridging through Memory: Speech Sound Recollected from Face Video" by Minsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their framework to two tasks: lip reading and speech reconstruction from silent video, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Application 1: Lip reading)** and **section 4.2 (Application 2: Speech reconstruction from silent video)**. In section 4.1.1, the authors mention two datasets used for lip reading:

1. **LRW Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale word-level English audio-visual dataset that includes 500 words with a maximum of 1,000 training videos each. The preprocessing details are also provided, which indicates the dataset's structure and usage.

2. **LRW-1000 Dataset**: This is a Mandarin words audio-visual dataset consisting of 718,018 video samples with 1,000 word classes. The authors also provide preprocessing details, which further clarifies how the dataset is utilized in their experiments.

In section 4.2.1, the authors mention the **GRID dataset** used for speech reconstruction from silent video. This dataset contains short English phrases and is sampled at specific rates for video and audio.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LRW Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung and Andrew Zisserman. *Lip Reading in the Wild*. In Asian Conference on Computer Vision, pages 87–103, 2016.

- For **LRW-1000 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shuang Yang et al. *LRW-1000: A Naturally-Distributed Large-Scale Benchmark for Lip Reading in the Wild*. In 2019 14th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition (FG 2019), pages 1–8, 2019.

- For **GRID Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Martin Cooke et al. *An Audio-Visual Corpus for Speech Perception and Automatic Speech Recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 120(5):2421–2424, 2006.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
