To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extreme Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression: A Fast and Robust Framework for Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Faxian Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two well-known hyperspectral image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe:

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset was acquired by the AVRIS sensor in 1992 and contains 145×145 pixels with 200 spectral bands after removing 20 bands affected by atmospheric conditions. It includes 10,366 labeled samples across 16 classes.

2. **Pavia University Dataset**: Acquired by the ROSIS instrument in 2001, this dataset consists of 610×340 pixels and 103 spectral bands after discarding 12 noisy bands. It contains 42,776 labeled samples across 9 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Indian Pines Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Plaza, A.; Benediktsson, J. A.; Boardman, J. W., et al. *Recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral image processing*. Remote Sens. Environ. 2009, 113, S110-S122.

- For the **Pavia University Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, J.; Marpu, P. R.; Plaza, A., et al. *Generalized composite kernel framework for hyperspectral image classification*. IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens. 2013, 51, 4816-4829.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for any future use.
