To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Regularized Multi-Scale Feature Flow for High Dynamic Range Imaging" by Qian Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of reconstructing HDR images from LDR images, which suggests that datasets related to HDR imaging may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they mention using the **HDR dataset** from Kalantari et al. (2017) for training, which consists of 74 samples for training and 15 samples for testing. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **testing data** subsection. The authors state that they evaluate their method on the datasets from **Sen et al. (2012)** and **Tursun et al. (2016)**, which do not contain ground truths for HDR images but are used for qualitative comparisons.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **HDR Dataset** (Kalantari et al.):
   > Nima Khademi Kalantari and Ravi Ramamoorthi. *Deep High Dynamic Range Imaging of Dynamic Scenes*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 36(4):144:1–144:12, 2017.

2. **Sen et al. Dataset**:
   > Pradeep Sen, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Maziar Yaesoubi, Soheil Darabi, Dan B Goldman, and Eli Shechtman. *Robust Patch-Based HDR Reconstruction of Dynamic Scenes*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 31(6):203:1–203:12, 2012.

3. **Tursun et al. Dataset**:
   > Okan Tarhan Tursun, Ahmet Oğuz Akyüz, Aykut Erdem, and Erkut Erdem. *An Objective Deghosting Quality Metric for HDR Images*. Computer Graphics Forum, 35:139–152, 2016.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its respective citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
