To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bounded logit attention: Learning to explain image classifiers" by Thomas Baumhauer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a trainable explanation module for convolutional image classifiers, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Cats vs. Dogs Dataset**: This dataset consists of 23,262 medium resolution color images divided equally into two classes: "cats" and "dogs." The authors specify that they resized all images to 224Ã—224 pixels.

2. **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: This dataset contains 20,580 medium size color images of 120 dog breeds, with 12,000 images used for training and 8,580 for validation.

3. **Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 11,788 color images of 200 bird species, with 5,994 images for training and 5,794 for validation.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations I find are:

- For the **Cats vs. Dogs Dataset**:

- For the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and provided proper citations for each.
