To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Networks Should Be Wide Enough to Learn Disconnected Decision Regions" by Quynh Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look for any references to datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. These sections typically detail the experimental setup and the datasets used. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets that the authors might have used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. This dataset is widely recognized in the machine learning community, particularly for image classification tasks involving handwritten digits.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors also refer to a synthetic dataset created for their experiments, which involves rotating images of the digit '1'. However, this dataset does not have a formal citation as it is generated by the authors for the purpose of their study.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Synthetic Digit-1 Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors involving rotated images of the digit '1'. This dataset does not have a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate.
