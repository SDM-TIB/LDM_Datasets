To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RCCNet: An Efficient Convolutional Neural Network for Histological Routine Colon Cancer Nuclei Classification" by S.H. Shabbeer Basha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a publicly available dataset called **CRCHistoPhenotypes**, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section**, specifically the **Dataset Description** subsection. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the **CRCHistoPhenotypes** dataset. They mention that it consists of 22,444 nuclei patches belonging to four classes: 'Epithelial', 'Inflammatory', 'Fibroblast', and 'Miscellaneous'. The dataset is described as having a total of 7,722 patches from the 'Epithelial' class, 5,712 from 'Fibroblast', 6,971 from 'Inflammatory', and 2,039 from 'Miscellaneous', with each patch having dimensions of 32 × 32 × 3.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CRCHistoPhenotypes** dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For **CRCHistoPhenotypes**, the citation is:
  > K. Sirinukunwattana, S. E. A. Raza, Y.-W. Tsang, D. R. Snead, I. A. Cree, and N. M. Rajpoot. *Locality sensitive deep learning for detection and classification of nuclei in routine colon cancer histology images*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, vol. 35, no. 5, pp. 1196–1206, 2016.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that the dataset name, description, and citation are clearly articulated.
