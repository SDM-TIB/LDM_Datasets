To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MB-DECTNet: A Model-Based Unrolled Network for Accurate 3D DECT Reconstruction" by Tao Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methods and results sections for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and mention their lab's previous work, but they do not specify any datasets here. I will move on to the **methods section**, where they describe the data acquisition process.

In **section 3.1 (Data Acquisition)**, the authors state that they used "five helical scans at 90 and 140 kVp of a head-and-neck cancer patient" for their experiments. This indicates that they have a specific dataset derived from clinical scans, which is crucial for their study.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the dataset, such as how it was processed or any specific characteristics. The authors mention that they selected four patient data as the training set and one as the test set, with a total of 168 samples in the training set. This information is important for describing the dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the dataset is derived from clinical scans, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on proprietary clinical data from a specific institution.

The relevant details I have gathered are as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Head-and-Neck Cancer Patient Scans
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of five helical scans at 90 and 140 kVp from a head-and-neck cancer patient. Four scans were used for training, and one was used for testing, totaling 168 samples in the training set.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset is derived from clinical data and does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is based on proprietary data from Washington University in St. Louis.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. I will ensure that the dataset entry includes all relevant details, including the description and the context of the dataset's origin.
