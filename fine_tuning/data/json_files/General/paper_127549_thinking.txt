To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KeyPosS: Plug-and-Play Facial Landmark Detection through GPS-Inspired True-Range Multilateration" by Xu Bao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will navigate to **section 4.1 (Dataset and Metric)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will carefully note the names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned:

1. **WFLW (Wider Facial Landmarks in-the-wild)**: This dataset includes 10,000 face images, annotated with 98 landmarks, and is designed to capture variations in pose, expression, and occlusion.

2. **AFLW (Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild)**: This dataset contains approximately 25,000 annotated face images from Flickr, with up to 21 landmarks per image, showcasing a wide range of appearances.

3. **300W**: This dataset consists of 600 images (300 indoor and 300 outdoor) with 68 landmarks annotated for each face, covering various identities and conditions.

4. **COCO-WholeBody**: This dataset extends the COCO dataset with whole-body annotations, including facial landmarks among other keypoints.

After identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **WFLW**, the citation is:
  > Wu, W., Qian, C., Yang, S., Wang, Q., Cai, Y., & Zhou, Q. (2018). Look at Boundary: A Boundary-Aware Face Alignment Algorithm. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2129–2138.

- For **AFLW**, the citation is:
  > Köstinger, M., Wohlhart, P., Roth, P. M., & Bischof, H. (2011). Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild: A large-scale, real-world database for facial landmark localization. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCVW), 2144–2151.

- For **300W**, the citation is:
  > Sagonas, C., Antonakos, E., Tzimiropoulos, G., Zafeiriou, S., & Pantic, M. (2016). 300 Faces In-The-Wild Challenge: database and results. Image and Vision Computing, 47, 3–18.

- For **COCO-WholeBody**, the citation is:
  > Jin, S., Xu, L., Xu, J., Wang, C., Liu, W., Qian, C., Ouyang, W., & Luo, P. (2020). Whole-Body Human Pose Estimation in the Wild. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 196–214.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all necessary information is captured for future reference or processing.
