To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Fake News Spreader Detection on Twitter using Character N-Grams" by Inna Vogel and Meghana Meghana, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fake news spreaders on Twitter, which suggests that there may be datasets related to Twitter user accounts and their tweets.

Next, I will focus on **section 1 (Dataset and Corpus Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset they used. They refer to the **PAN 2020 author profiling corpus**, which is crucial for my extraction process. The authors describe this corpus in detail, noting that it consists of 300 English and 300 Spanish Twitter user accounts, with each account containing 100 tweets stored in XML format.

I will summarize the key details of the dataset:
- **PAN 2020 Author Profiling Corpus**: This dataset includes 300 English and 300 Spanish Twitter user accounts, with each account containing 100 tweets. The tweets are balanced between users identified as fake news spreaders and credible users.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PAN 2020 author profiling corpus. The relevant citation is:
> Rangel, F., Rosso, P., Ghanem, B., Giachanou, A. (2020). *Profiling fake news spreaders on Twitter*. In: PAN at CLEF 2020 Fake News Spreader Twitter Dataset. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3692319

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the PAN 2020 author profiling corpus, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
