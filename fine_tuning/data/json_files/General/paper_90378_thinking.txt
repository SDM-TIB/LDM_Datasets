To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "NOISY TEXT DATA: ACHILLES’ HEEL OF BERT" by Ankit Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate BERT's performance on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they focus on the performance of BERT on noisy text data and refer to various NLP tasks. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Moving to **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and consists of 25,000 training and 25,000 test sentences. The authors create multiple noisy variants of this dataset, which they refer to as IMDB0, IMDB2.5, ..., IMDB22.5.

2. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset is also used for sentiment analysis and contains 67,349 training and 872 test sentences. Similar to the IMDB dataset, the authors create noisy variants of SST-2, labeled SST-20, SST-22.5, ..., SST-222.5.

3. **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS-B)**: This dataset is used for the textual similarity task and consists of 5,749 training and 1,500 test data points. The original dataset is referred to as STS-B0, with noisy variants created as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies-volume 1, pages 142–150, 2011.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631–1642, 2013.

- For the **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS-B)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity-multilingual and cross-lingual focused evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.00055, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
