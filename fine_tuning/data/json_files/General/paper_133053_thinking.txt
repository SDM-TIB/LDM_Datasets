To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Multi-head Contrastive Learning" by Lei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. This dataset is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images. This dataset is also widely used in the field of machine learning.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset includes images from 10 classes with a higher resolution of 96x96 pixels and provides a substantial set of unlabeled images, making it suitable for self-supervised learning tasks.

4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: Contains 100,000 images of 200 classes, with each image downsized to 64x64 pixels. This dataset is often used for benchmarking in image classification.

5. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing over 14 million annotated images, widely used in various computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
