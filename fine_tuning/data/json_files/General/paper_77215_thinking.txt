To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Alternative View: When Does SGD Escape Local Minima?" by Robert Kleinberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Empirical Observations)** and any dedicated **Datasets section** if available. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details about their size, structure, and any relevant characteristics.

While reviewing the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to datasets like **CIFAR-10** or **CIFAR-100**, I will ensure to gather details about these datasets, such as their purpose and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For instance, if the paper mentions the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Similarly, I will find the citation for **CIFAR-100**:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my approach involves:
1. Reading the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identifying specific sections that discuss datasets in detail.
3. Noting down the datasets and their characteristics.
4. Retrieving full citations from the References section.
5. Compiling the information for clarity and accessibility.
