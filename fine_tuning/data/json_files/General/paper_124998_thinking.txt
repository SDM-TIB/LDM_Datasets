To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Possibilities of AI-Generated Text Detection" by Souradip Chakraborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that empirical evaluations were conducted across multiple datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental studies section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they utilized. In this section, they mention four datasets:

1. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as containing news articles, and it is used for generating machine-generated text. The authors cite the original paper for this dataset.

2. **SQuAD Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing Wikipedia paragraphs and is also used for generating machine-generated text. The original paper for this dataset is cited as well.

3. **IMDb Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. They provide a citation for the original paper that introduced this dataset.

4. **Kaggle FakeNews Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for its use in detecting fake news. The authors include a citation for the dataset's source.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **XSum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B. Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1797–1807, Brussels, Belgium, October-November 2018.

- For **SQuAD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 2383–2392, Austin, Texas, November 2016.

- For **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Maas, Raymond E Daly, Peter T Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies, pp. 142–150, 2011.

- For **Kaggle FakeNews Dataset**, the citation is:
  > William Lifferth. *Fake news*. 2018. URL: https://kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
