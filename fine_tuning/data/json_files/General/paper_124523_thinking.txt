To extract datasets from the research paper titled "G-EVAL: NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment" by Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of NLG systems and mentions the use of two generation tasks: text summarization and dialogue generation. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks may be present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology and experiments sections**. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on three meta-evaluation benchmarks: **SummEval**, **Topical-Chat**, and **QAGS**. This suggests that these benchmarks are datasets used for evaluation.

I will then check the **experiments section** in detail to gather more information about each dataset:

1. **SummEval**: This benchmark is used for summarization evaluation and is built on the **CNN/DailyMail dataset**. The authors reference the original paper that introduced this dataset.
   
2. **Topical-Chat**: This dataset is used for evaluating dialogue response generation systems and is mentioned as a testbed for meta-evaluating different evaluators.

3. **QAGS**: This benchmark is designed to evaluate hallucinations in summarization tasks and includes two different summarization datasets: **CNN/DailyMail** and **XSum**.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CNN/DailyMail dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomas Kocisky, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 28, 2015.

- For **XSum**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, 2018.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
