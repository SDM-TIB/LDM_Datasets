To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VIDEOADVISER: VIDEO KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION FOR MULTIMODAL TRANSFER LEARNING" by Yanan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **MOSI**, **MOSEI**, and **VEGAS** datasets, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly section 5, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **MOSI Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being collected from online videos for evaluating video-level sentiment analysis tasks. The authors provide a brief description of its size and the annotation scale used.

2. **MOSEI Dataset**: Similar to MOSI, this dataset is also used for video-level sentiment analysis and is noted for its modifications to ensure fair evaluation. The authors mention that it is annotated with a Likert scale ranging from -3 to +3.

3. **VEGAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for the audio-visual retrieval task and is described as containing 28,103 videos, with each video represented by audio and visual feature vectors.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MOSI Dataset**:
  > Zadeh, A., Zellers, R., Pincus, E., & Morency, L.-P. (2016). *MOSI: Multimodal corpus of sentiment intensity and subjectivity analysis in online opinion videos*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1605.00690.

- For **MOSEI Dataset**:
  > Bagher Zadeh, A., Liang, P. P., Poria, S., Cambria, E., & Morency, L.-P. (2018). *Multimodal language analysis in the wild: CMU-MOSEI dataset and interpretable dynamic fusion graph*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2236–2246.

- For **VEGAS Dataset**:
  > Zhou, Y., Wang, Z., Fang, C., Bui, T., & Berg, T. L. (2018). *Visual to sound: Generating natural sound for videos in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3550–3558.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
