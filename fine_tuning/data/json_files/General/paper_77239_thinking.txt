To extract datasets from the research paper titled "500+ Times Faster Than Deep Learning" by Suvodeep Majumder et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a case study involving text mining on Stack Overflow, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this topic. The introduction further discusses the use of a dataset from Stack Overflow, indicating that this is a key dataset for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the **experimental design section** (Section 3) is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets. I will focus on **Section 3.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention using a dataset that includes 6,400 training examples and 1,600 testing examples, specifically related to Stack Overflow posts.

The authors also reference previous works by Xu et al. and Fu et al., indicating that they are using the same datasets as those studies. This is a crucial point, as it allows me to identify the original sources of the datasets.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following relevant works:

1. For the dataset used in the study by Xu et al.:
   > Bowen Xu, Deheng Ye, Zhenchang Xing, Xin Xia, Guibin Chen, and Shanping Li. *Predicting semantically linkable knowledge in developer online forums via convolutional neural network*. In Proceedings of the 31st IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, pages 51â€“62, 2016.

2. For the dataset used in the study by Fu et al.:
   > Wei Fu and Tim Menzies. *Easy over Hard: A Case Study on Deep Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.00133, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Stack Overflow Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,400 training examples and 1,600 testing examples, specifically related to knowledge units tagged with "java" from Stack Overflow posts.

- **Citations**:
   - Xu et al. dataset citation: Bowen Xu et al. (2016).
   - Fu et al. dataset citation: Wei Fu and Tim Menzies (2017).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets and their citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
