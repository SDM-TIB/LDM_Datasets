To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An End-to-End Dialogue State Tracking System with Machine Reading Comprehension and Wide & Deep Classification" by Yue Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on a test dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, **Table 1** provides a summary of the datasets used, including the number of dialogues, domains, services, and zero-shot services. The table indicates that the training dataset consists of 16,142 dialogues across 16 domains, while the development and test datasets contain 2,482 and 4,201 dialogues, respectively.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper refers to the **DSTC 8 Track 4** competition, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets used. However, it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely derived from the competition's framework.

To summarize the datasets extracted:
1. **Training Dataset**: Contains 16,142 dialogues across 16 domains.
2. **Development Dataset**: Contains 2,482 dialogues across 16 domains.
3. **Test Dataset**: Contains 4,201 dialogues across 18 domains, with a significant portion being zero-shot services.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for these datasets, I will note that they are part of the **DSTC 8 Track 4** competition, which can be referenced as follows:
> Rastogi, A., Zang, X., Sunkara, S., Gupta, R., & Khaitan, P. (2019). *Towards scalable multi-domain conversational agents: The schema-guided dialogue dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.05855.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
