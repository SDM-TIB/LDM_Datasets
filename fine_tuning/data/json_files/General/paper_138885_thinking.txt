To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AIR-Bench: Benchmarking Large Audio-Language Models via Generative Comprehension" by Qian Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of AIR-Bench, which is a benchmark for evaluating audio-language models. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this benchmark.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In the paper, the authors describe two benchmarks: the **foundation benchmark** and the **chat benchmark**. I will focus on these sections to identify any datasets used for these benchmarks.

In the **foundation benchmark** section, the authors list various tasks and their corresponding datasets. I will extract the datasets mentioned along with their descriptions. For example, they mention:

1. **Librispeech**: A dataset for automatic speech recognition.
   - Citation: Panayotov, V., Chen, G., Povey, D., & Khudanpur, S. (2015). *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210.

2. **Common Voice**: A multilingual speech corpus.
   - Citation: Ardila, R., Branson, M., Davis, K., Henretty, M., Kohler, M., Meyer, J., Morais, R., Saunders, L., Tyers, F. M., & Weber, G. (2019). *Common voice: A massively multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670.

3. **MELD**: A multimodal dataset for emotion recognition in conversations.
   - Citation: Poria, S., Hazarika, D., Majumder, N., Naik, G., Cambria, E., & Mihalcea, R. (2018). *MELD: A multimodal multi-party dataset for emotion recognition in conversations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02508.

4. **IEMOCAP**: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database.
   - Citation: Busso, C., Bulut, M., Lee, C.-C., Kazemzadeh, A., Mower, E., Kim, S., Chang, J.-N., Lee, S., & Narayanan, S. S. (2008). *IEMOCAP: Interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 42(4), 335-359.

In the **chat benchmark** section, I will also look for datasets mentioned. For instance, they mention:

1. **Clotho**: An audio captioning dataset.
   - Citation: Drossos, K., Lipping, S., & Virtanen, T. (2020). *Clotho: An audio captioning dataset*. In ICASSP 2020-2020 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 736–740.

2. **MusicCaps**: A dataset for automatic music captioning.
   - Citation: Agostinelli, A., Denk, T. I., Borsos, Z., Engel, J., Verzetti, M., Caillon, A., Huang, Q., Jansen, A., Roberts, A., Tagliasacchi, M., et al. (2023). *MusicLM: Generating music from text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.11325.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy access and review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper.
