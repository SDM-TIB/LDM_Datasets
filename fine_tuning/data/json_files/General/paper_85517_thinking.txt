To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Defending Against Label Flipping Attacks on Malware Detection Systems" by Rahim Taheri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their algorithms on three Android datasets: **Drebin**, **Contagio**, and **Genome**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used in their evaluations. Here, they provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **Drebin Dataset**: This dataset consists of 118,505 applications/samples from various Android sources. It is a well-known dataset for Android malware detection.

2. **Contagio Dataset**: This dataset includes 11,960 mobile malware samples and 16,800 benign samples. It is another significant dataset used for evaluating malware detection systems.

3. **Genome Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 1,200 samples of Android malware collected from different categories, supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) project.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Drebin Dataset**:
  > Arp, D., Spreitzenbarth, M., Hubner, M., Gascon, H., Rieck, K., Siemens, C. (2014). *Drebin: Effective and explainable detection of android malware in your pocket*. In Proceedings of the NDSS, pp. 23–26.

- **Contagio Dataset**:
  > Contagio dataset. (2020). Retrieved from http://contagiominidump.blogspot.com/

- **Genome Dataset**:
  > Jiang, X., Zhou, Y. (2012). *Dissecting android malware: Characterization and evolution*. In Proceedings of IEEE S&P, pp. 95–109.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
