To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How to Prune Your Language Model: Recovering Accuracy on the 'Sparsity May Cry' Benchmark" by Eldar Kurtic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the introduction, the authors mention the "Sparsity May Cry (SMC-Bench)" benchmark and reference specific tasks such as **CommonsenseQA** and **WinoGrande**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in detail, particularly in sections 4 and 5. They explicitly mention using the **CommonsenseQA** and **WinoGrande** datasets for their evaluations on the SMC benchmark.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the context of the datasets used.

1. **CommonsenseQA**: This dataset is referenced in the paper, and I will look for its citation in the references section. The citation is:
   > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00937, 2018.

2. **WinoGrande**: Similarly, I will find the citation for this dataset. The citation is:
   > Keisuke Sakaguchi, Ronan Le Bras, Chandra Bhagavatula, and Yejin Choi. *Winogrande: An adversarial winograd schema challenge at scale*. Communications of the ACM, 64(9):99â€“106, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper references for further exploration or validation.
