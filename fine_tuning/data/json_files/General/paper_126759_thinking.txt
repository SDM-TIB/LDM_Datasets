To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Logit-Based Ensemble Distribution Distillation for Robust Autoregressive Sequence Uncertainties" by Yassir Fathullah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their focus on uncertainty estimation for sequence prediction tasks, particularly in machine translation. This suggests that datasets related to translation tasks may be involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly section 5, where the authors describe their experiments on machine translation tasks. Here, they mention using the **En-De WMT’16** and **En-Ru WMT’20** datasets for training and evaluation. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of sentence pairs.

The paper also references three out-of-domain datasets used for evaluating detection performance: **Khresmoi**, **MTNT**, and **KFTT**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets as well, including their types and the context in which they are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **En-De WMT’16 Dataset**:
   > Myle Ott, Sergey Edunov, David Grangier, and Michael Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation: Research Papers, 2018.

2. **En-Ru WMT’20 Dataset**:

3. **Khresmoi Dataset**:

4. **MTNT Dataset**:

5. **KFTT Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
