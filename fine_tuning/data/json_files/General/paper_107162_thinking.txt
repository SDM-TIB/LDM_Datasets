To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DetarNet: Decoupling Translation and Rotation by Siamese Network for Point Cloud Registration" by Zhi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method improves registration performance on both indoor and outdoor scenes, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using the **KITTI dataset** and the **SUN3D dataset** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors state that they used the KITTI odometry dataset, which contains 11 outdoor driving scenarios of point clouds. They followed a specific splitting method for training, validation, and testing, which is crucial information for understanding how the dataset was applied.

2. **SUN3D Dataset**: The paper describes the SUN3D dataset as composed of 268 sequences of RGBD videos. The authors mention that they randomly selected sequences for training and validation, and they also detail how point clouds were generated from the video sequences.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **KITTI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354–3361, 2012.

- For the **SUN3D dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jianxiong Xiao, Abhinav Owens, and Antonio Torralba. *SUN3D: A database of big spaces reconstructed using SFM and object labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1625–1632, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
