To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Continual learning-based probabilistic slow feature analysis for monitoring multimode nonstationary processes" by Jingxin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its application to monitoring processes, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Monitoring Procedure and Experiment Design)**, where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using a **Continuous Stirred Tank Heater (CSTH)** and a **coal pulverizing system** as case studies. I will look for specific datasets related to these systems.

In **Table II**, the authors provide detailed information about the CSTH, including the number of training and testing samples for different modes. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the CSTH.

Additionally, in **Table V**, the authors present experimental data for the coal pulverizing system, including the number of training and testing samples, as well as fault locations and causes. This suggests that there is a dataset associated with the coal pulverizing system as well.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets by checking the references section of the paper. However, since the datasets are derived from the authors' experiments and not from external sources, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the datasets.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

1. **Continuous Stirred Tank Heater (CSTH) Dataset**:
   > Zhang, J., Zhou, D., Chen, M., & Hong, X. (2022). Continual learning-based probabilistic slow feature analysis for monitoring multimode nonstationary processes. *Journal of Process Control*, 103, 76-86.

2. **Coal Pulverizing System Dataset**:
   > Zhang, J., Zhou, D., Chen, M., & Hong, X. (2022). Continual learning-based probabilistic slow feature analysis for monitoring multimode nonstationary processes. *Journal of Process Control*, 103, 76-86.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise overview of the datasets used in the research.
