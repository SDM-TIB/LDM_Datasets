To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptual Assessment and Optimization of HDR Image Rendering" by Peibei Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **four HDR image quality datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss their experimental setups. In this section, they mention the four datasets used for benchmarking their HDR quality metrics:

1. **Narwaria2013 Dataset**: This dataset contains 140 HDR images and is referenced in the context of HDR image quality assessment.

2. **Valenzise2014 Dataset**: This dataset includes 50 HDR images and is also used for evaluating HDR quality metrics.

3. **Zerman2017 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 100 HDR images, contributing to the assessment of the proposed metrics.

4. **UPIQ Dataset**: This dataset is the largest, containing 4,159 images, including 380 HDR and 3,779 LDR images, and is noted for its careful alignment of scores to a common perceptual scale.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Narwaria2013**, the citation is:
  > Manish Narwaria, Matthieu Perreira Da Silva, Patrick Le Callet, and Romuald Pepion. *Tone mapping-based high-dynamic-range image compression: Study of optimization criterion and perceptual quality*. Optical Engineering, 52(10):102008:1–102008:15, 2013.

- For **Valenzise2014**, the citation is:
  > Giuseppe Valenzise, Francesca De Simone, Paul Lauga, and Frederic Dufaux. *Performance evaluation of objective quality metrics for HDR image compression*. In Applications of Digital Image Processing XXXVII, pages 78–87, 2014.

- For **Zerman2017**, the citation is:
  > Emin Zerman, Giuseppe Valenzise, and Frederic Dufaux. *An extensive performance evaluation of full-reference HDR image quality metrics*. Quality and User Experience, 2(5):1–16, 2017.

- For **UPIQ**, the citation is:
  > Aliaksei Mikhailiuk, María Pérez-Ortiz, Dingcheng Yue, Wilson Suen, and Rafał K. Mantiuk. *Consolidated dataset and metrics for high-dynamic-range image quality*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 24(67):2125–2138, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
