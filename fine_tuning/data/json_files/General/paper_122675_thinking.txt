To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Boosted Soft Trees" by Tristan Cinquin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed models were evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction may provide context on the datasets used for experiments, so I will look for any specific names or descriptions.

Next, I will focus on the **methods** and **experiments** sections, particularly section 5, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention a suite of regression datasets used for evaluation. I will specifically look for a table or a description that outlines these datasets, including their names and any relevant details such as the number of samples and features.

From the text, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Boston Dataset**: Contains 506 samples with 13 features.
2. **Naval Dataset**: Contains 11,934 samples with 16 features.
3. **Power Dataset**: Contains 11,568 samples with 4 features.
4. **Protein Dataset**: Contains 45,730 samples with 9 features.
5. **Yacht Dataset**: Contains 308 samples with 6 features.
6. **Song Dataset**: Contains 514,345 samples with 90 features.
7. **Concrete Dataset**: Contains 1,030 samples with 8 features.
8. **Energy Dataset**: Contains 768 samples with 8 features.
9. **Kin8nm Dataset**: Contains 8,192 samples with 8 features.
10. **Wine Dataset**: Contains 1,599 samples with 11 features.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Some datasets may have specific papers or sources that describe them in detail. For example, the Boston dataset is commonly known and can be cited as:

- **Boston Housing Dataset**: 
  > Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1):81-102.

For the other datasets, I will look for similar references in the citations provided in the paper or through external sources.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant details are included for each dataset.
