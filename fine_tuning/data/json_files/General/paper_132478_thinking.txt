To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MindGPT: Non-Invasive Brain Recordings Interpreting What You See" by Jiaxuan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The MindGPT Approach)**, particularly the **subsection 3.1 (Dataset and Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they utilized the **DIR dataset**, which is specifically designed for fMRI-based decoding. The authors describe the dataset's structure, including the number of images and the experimental setup involving healthy subjects.

In this section, the authors detail that the DIR dataset consists of 1200 training images and 50 test images, collected while subjects viewed natural images from ImageNet. They also mention that the DIR dataset contains a larger number of image-fMRI pairs compared to previous datasets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's significance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DIR dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced the DIR dataset, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the DIR dataset is:
> Guohua Shen, Kshitij Dwivedi, Kei Majima, Tomoyasu Horikawa, and Yukiyasu Kamitani. *End-to-end deep image reconstruction from human brain activity*. Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 13:21, 2019.

Additionally, the authors mention that the visual stimuli used in their experiments are identical to those from another dataset, which is the **ImageNet dataset**. I will also retrieve the citation for ImageNet from the references.

The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the DIR dataset and the ImageNet dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
