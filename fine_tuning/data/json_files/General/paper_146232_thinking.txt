To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Model Enhanced Knowledge Representation Learning: A Survey" by Xin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experiments section typically contains detailed information about the datasets employed in the research.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention various datasets used for their evaluations. I will carefully note each dataset's name, purpose, and any specific details provided about them.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **FIGER**: This dataset is designed for fine-grained entity recognition, providing annotations for a wide range of entity types.
2. **Open Entity**: Used for entity typing in an open-domain setting, it helps classify entities into predefined categories.
3. **TACRED**: A large-scale relation extraction dataset created by Stanford, annotated with various relation types.
4. **FewRel**: A benchmark dataset for evaluating relation classification tasks with limited examples.
5. **WN11**: A subset of the WordNet knowledge graph, focusing on knowledge graph completion tasks.
6. **FB13**: Derived from the Freebase knowledge graph, used for relation extraction and knowledge base completion tasks.
7. **WN9**: Another subset of the WordNet knowledge graph, designed for knowledge graph completion and link prediction.
8. **FB15K**: A widely used benchmark dataset derived from Freebase for knowledge graph completion and entity resolution.
9. **FB15k-237**: A subset of FB15K, created to address redundancy and test leakage issues.
10. **WN18RR**: A refined version of the WN18 dataset for benchmarking link prediction and knowledge graph completion models.
11. **UMLS**: A comprehensive dataset used in biomedical and healthcare research, integrating various health vocabularies.
12. **NELL-One**: A few-shot learning dataset derived from the Never-Ending Language Learning system.
13. **CoDEx**: A suite of knowledge graph completion datasets designed for diverse benchmarks.
14. **Wikidata5M**: A large-scale dataset derived from Wikidata, containing millions of entities and relations.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
