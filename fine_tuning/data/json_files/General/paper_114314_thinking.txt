To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Density-Distance Fields" by Itsuki Ueda et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it can hint at the types of experiments conducted. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used in detail in a specific section. I will pay close attention to any datasets mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors may describe the datasets used for training and testing their proposed method. If they mention any datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "NeRF synthetic dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 405â€“421, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset and its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete and correctly formatted, ready for any further processing or review.
