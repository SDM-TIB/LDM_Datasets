To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unexplainable Explanations: Towards Interpreting tSNE and UMAP Embeddings" by Andrew Draganov and Simon Dohn, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of tSNE and UMAP for dimensionality reduction but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **related work and experiments sections**. These sections typically provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. They describe how they applied tSNE and UMAP to visualize embeddings from the last convolutional layer of a VGG11 model trained on MNIST. This is a clear indication that MNIST is one of the datasets used.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but it is important to provide the correct citation as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: 
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their proper citations.
