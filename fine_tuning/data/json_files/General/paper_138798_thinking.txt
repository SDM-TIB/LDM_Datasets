To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The SkipSponge Attack: Sponge Weight Poisoning of Deep Neural Networks" by Stefanos Koffas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on various models and datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, specifically **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images across 10 classes.
3. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: The authors specify a special split of 39,209 training images and 12,630 testing images.
4. **TinyImageNet (TIN)**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, used for image classification tasks.
5. **CelebA**: A dataset with 200,599 training images and 2,000 test images, each annotated with 40 binary attribute labels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

- **CIFAR10**:

- **CelebA**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are accurately represented and properly cited, which is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility in research.
