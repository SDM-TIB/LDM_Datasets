To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Transfer from Pre-Trained Language Models to CIF-Based Speech Recognizers via Hierarchical Distillation" by Minglun Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference the **AISHELL-1 dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide more details about the AISHELL-1 dataset. They mention that it contains **178 hours of audio** and that they extracted **80-channel filterbank features** from it. Additionally, they specify the output vocabulary, which includes **4230 Chinese characters** and four special tokens.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AISHELL-1 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **AISHELL-1 Dataset**:
  > Hui Bu et al., “AISHELL-1: An open-source Mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline,” in O-COCOSDA. IEEE, 2017, pp. 1–5.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the AISHELL-1 dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's details and citation.

After gathering all necessary information, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
