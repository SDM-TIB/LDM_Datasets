To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymptotic Unbiased Sample Sampling to Speed Up Sharpness-Aware Minimization" by Jiaxin Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method (AUSAM) across various tasks, including classification and human pose estimation, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction outlines the context and significance of the research but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, the authors mention conducting experiments on the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each image resized to 64x64 pixels.
4. **MPII Human Pose Dataset**: A dataset for human pose estimation containing around 40,000 images with annotated body joints.

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations I find are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- For **MPII Human Pose Dataset**:
  > Mykhaylo Andriluka, Leonid Pishchulin, Peter Gehler, and Bernt Schiele. *2D human pose estimation: New benchmark and state of the art analysis*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
