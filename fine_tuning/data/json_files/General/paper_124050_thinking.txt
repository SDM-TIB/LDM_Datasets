To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "CTRAN: CNN-Transformer-based Network for Natural Language Understanding" by Mehrdad Rafiepour and Javad Salimi Sartakhti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors applied their network on **ATIS** and **SNIPS**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **ATIS Dataset**: This dataset is widely adopted for evaluating natural language understanding models. It contains 4,478 training examples, 500 for validation, and 893 for testing. The dataset includes 127 slot types and 21 intents.

2. **SNIPS Dataset**: This dataset is from the SNIPS personal assistant and consists of 13,084 training examples, 700 for validation, and 700 for testing. It includes 7 types of intents and 72 types of slots.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ATIS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C., Godfrey, J., & Doddington, G. (1990). *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990. URL: https://aclanthology.org/H90-1021.

- For the **SNIPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., et al. (2018). *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets and their citations. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
