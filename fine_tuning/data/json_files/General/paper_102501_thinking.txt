To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DPT: Deformable Patch-based Transformer for Visual Recognition" by Zhiyang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the authors conducted extensive evaluations on image classification and object detection, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **ImageNet** for image classification and **MS COCO** for object detection. These are two well-known datasets in the field of computer vision.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 1.28 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, covering 1,000 categories.
2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is a large-scale detection benchmark with a training set of 118,000 images and a validation set of 5,000 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories.
2. **MS COCO**: A comprehensive dataset for object detection with 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
