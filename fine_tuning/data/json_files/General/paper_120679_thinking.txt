To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Complex Knowledge Base Question Answering via Question-to-Action and Question-to-Question Alignment" by Yechun Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CQA** and **WQSP** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as a dedicated **Datasets** or **Experiments** section. In this paper, the authors refer to the **CQA dataset** and the **WQSP dataset** in the **Experiments** section, where they discuss their experimental setup and results.

1. **CQA Dataset**: The paper describes the CQA dataset as a large-scale dataset containing 944K training pairs, 100K validation pairs, and 156K test pairs. It consists of seven types of complex questions, making it a challenging dataset for the model.

2. **WQSP Dataset**: The WQSP dataset is mentioned as containing 4,737 simple questions. The authors state that their method performs well on this dataset, indicating its relevance in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **CQA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Amrita Saha, Ghulam Ahmed Ansari, Abhishek Laddha, Karthik Sankaranarayanan, and Soumen Chakrabarti. *Complex Sequential Question Answering: Towards Learning to Converse over Linked Question Answer Pairs with a Knowledge Graph*. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Second AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2018.

- For the **WQSP dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wen-tau Yih, Ming-Wei Chang, Xiaodong He, and Jianfeng Gao. *Semantic Parsing via Staged Query Graph Generation: Question Answering with Knowledge Base*. In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
