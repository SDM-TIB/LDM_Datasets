To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Personalized Federated Learning by Structured and Unstructured Pruning Under Data Heterogeneity" by Saeed Vahidian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on "different benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **EMNIST**: An extension of the MNIST dataset that includes handwritten letters, providing a more comprehensive dataset for character recognition.
4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

The authors also mention how they partition these datasets into non-IID distributions for their experiments, which is crucial for understanding the context in which these datasets are used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **EMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Gregory Cohen, Saeed Afshar, Jonathan Tapson, and Andre Van Schaik. *EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters*. 2017 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), 2017. doi: 10.1109/ijcnn.2017.7966217.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
