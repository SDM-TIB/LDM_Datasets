To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Fully Automated Deep Learning-enabled Detection for Hepatic Steatosis on Computed Tomography: A Multicenter International Validation Study" by Zhongyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates an AI system on **eight international datasets**, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their study. They specifically mention that they collected **1,014 CT images from eight publicly available datasets**. The datasets listed are:

1. **LIDC-IDRI**: This dataset is used for lung cancer detection and contains CT scans from multiple institutions in the USA.
2. **NSCLC-Lung1**: This dataset consists of CT scans from patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the Netherlands.
3. **RIDER**: This dataset includes CT scans from patients with lung cancer, collected at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in the USA.
4. **VESSEL12**: This dataset is focused on lung vessel segmentation and includes scans from hospitals in the Netherlands and Spain.
5. **MIDRC-RICORD-1A**: This dataset contains chest CT scans of COVID-19 positive patients from multiple international sites.
6. **MIDRC-RICORD-1B**: Similar to RICORD-1A, this dataset also includes chest CT scans of COVID-19 positive patients.
7. **COVID-19-Italy**: This dataset consists of CT scans from COVID-19 positive patients in Italy.
8. **COVID-19-China**: This dataset includes CT scans from COVID-19 positive patients in China.

In the **Results section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used for evaluating their AI methods, providing further validation of their use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
