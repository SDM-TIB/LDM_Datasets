To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling Provable Adversarial Defenses" by Eric Wong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST** and **CIFAR** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST** dataset for digit classification and the **CIFAR10** dataset for image classification. I will take note of any specific details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics or any modifications made for the experiments.

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit classification. The authors mention using it in their experiments and provide results related to robust error rates.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The authors also report results for this dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
