To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Systolic-CNN: An OpenCL-defined Scalable Run-time-flexible FPGA Accelerator Architecture for Accelerating Convolutional Neural Network Inference in Cloud/Edge Computing" by Akshay Dua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the Systolic-CNN architecture on various CNN models, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention that the experiments were conducted using the **ImageNet dataset** for AlexNet and the **COCO dataset** for RetinaNet. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that the **ImageNet dataset** is a large-scale hierarchical image database, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision. The **COCO dataset** is also referenced as a dataset for object detection tasks, which is important for understanding the context of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
