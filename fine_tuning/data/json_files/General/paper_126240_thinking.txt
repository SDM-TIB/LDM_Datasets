To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MrTF: Model Refinery for Transductive Federated Learning" by Xin-Chun Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted "abundant experimental studies" which suggests that multiple datasets are likely involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention several datasets in the context of their experiments, specifically in section 5. They categorize the datasets into different tasks such as digits recognition and image classification.

I will identify the datasets mentioned:
1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **MNISTm**: A modified version of MNIST.
3. **SVHN**: Street View House Numbers dataset.
4. **CIFAR10**: A dataset for image classification with 10 classes.
5. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes.
6. **FeMnist**: A dataset that combines digits and characters.
7. **Shakespeare**: A dataset constructed from the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In section 5.1, the authors provide statistics for these datasets, which confirms their usage in the experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
