To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint-DetNAS: Upgrade Your Detector with NAS, Pruning and Dynamic Distillation" by Lewei Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on **MS COCO**, which is a well-known dataset for object detection tasks. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Datasets and evaluation metrics** subsection, the authors explicitly mention using **MS COCO** for their experiments. They also specify that the mean Average Precision (mAP) is used as the performance metric, which is standard for evaluating object detection models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **MS COCO** dataset. The citation for MS COCO is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MS COCO dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
