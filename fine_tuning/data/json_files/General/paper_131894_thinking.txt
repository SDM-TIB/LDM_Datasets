To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence of Gradient-based MAML in LQR" by Negin Musavi and Geir E. Dullerud, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss the application of MAML to LQR tasks, but I need to confirm if they used any specific datasets for their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors describe the LQR tasks in detail, indicating that they are using a set of LQR tasks defined by tuples of matrices (Ai, Bi, Qi, Ri). However, they do not reference any publicly available datasets or benchmark datasets typically used in machine learning research. Instead, they generate the LQR tasks based on specific parameters.

Since there are no external datasets cited in the paper, I will note that the authors created their own synthetic datasets based on the LQR framework. I will document this as follows:

1. **LQR Tasks**: The authors define a set of LQR tasks characterized by tuples of matrices (Ai, Bi, Qi, Ri), where Ai and Bi are fixed matrices, and Qi and Ri are generated based on random coefficients drawn from a specified interval.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets or benchmarks that could be relevant. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical works and previous studies on MAML and LQR, without specific datasets mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

- **LQR Tasks**: The datasets used in this research are synthetic LQR tasks defined by the matrices (Ai, Bi, Qi, Ri), generated based on specific parameters and random coefficients.

In conclusion, I will compile the information regarding the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that the datasets are not publicly available but are generated for the purpose of this study. I will also note that no external dataset citations are provided in the paper.
