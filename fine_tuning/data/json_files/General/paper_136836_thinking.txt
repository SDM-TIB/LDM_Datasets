To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperMix: Out-of-Distribution Detection and Classification in Few-Shot Settings" by Nikhil Mehta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **CIFAR-FS** and **MiniImageNet**, which suggests these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. In this section, they explicitly mention:

1. **CIFAR-FS**: This dataset consists of 32x32 color images derived from the CIFAR-100 dataset, split into 64 classes for meta-training, 16 for validation, and 20 for meta-testing, with 600 images per class.

2. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is a common benchmark for few-shot learning, consisting of 84x84 color images with 100 classes, each containing 600 examples. The authors use 64 classes for meta-training, 16 for validation, and 20 for meta-testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-FS**, the citation is:
  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P. H. S., & Vedaldi, A. (2019). Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers. *ICLR*.

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. 

This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research, along with their proper citations, which is crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
