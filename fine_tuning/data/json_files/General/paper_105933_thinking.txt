To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improvements to short-term weather prediction with recurrent-convolutional networks" by Jussi Leinonen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Weather4cast 2021 competition**, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with this competition.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The author discusses the competition and the variables involved, such as temperature, convective rainfall rate, probability of tropopause folding, and cloud mask. However, I need to find explicit references to datasets.

In the **models and training section**, the author mentions that the predictions utilized the **IEEE Big Data Cup competition dataset**, which included new training data from various regions. This indicates that there is a dataset associated with the competition.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The author discusses the performance of models on the competition leaderboards, but I need to ensure that I have the correct dataset names and details.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset identified is:

- **Weather4cast 2021 competition dataset**: This dataset is used for training and evaluation in the competition. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is likely a competition dataset hosted by the organizers.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the Weather4cast dataset, I will note that it is associated with the competition and provide the URL for the competition for reference:
> Weather4cast 2021 competition. Available at: https://www.iarai.ac.at/weather4cast/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I have the correct citations or references for any datasets mentioned in the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
