To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sim-T: Simplify the Transformer Network by Multiplexing Technique for Speech Recognition" by Guangyong Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on three datasets: **Aishell-1**, **HKUST**, and **WSJ eval92**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they validated the effectiveness of the proposed Sim-T network using the following datasets:

1. **Aishell-1**: This dataset is described as a Mandarin speech corpus used for automatic speech recognition (ASR). 

2. **HKUST**: This dataset is also a Mandarin telephone speech corpus, which is widely used in ASR research.

3. **WSJ eval92**: This dataset is based on the Wall Street Journal corpus and is commonly used for English speech recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Aishell-1**, the citation is:
  > Bu H, Du J, Na X, et al. "Aishell-1: An open-source mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline." Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment, 2017, pp. 1-5.

- For **HKUST**, the citation is:
  > Liu Y, Fung P, Yang Y, et al. "HKUST/MTS: A very large scale mandarin telephone speech corpus." International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing, 2006, pp. 724-735.

- For **WSJ eval92**, the citation is:
  > Paul D B, Baker J. "The design for the Wall Street Journal-based CSR corpus." Proceedings of the workshop on Speech and Natural Language, 1992, pp. 357â€“362.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and organized presentation of the datasets used in the research.
