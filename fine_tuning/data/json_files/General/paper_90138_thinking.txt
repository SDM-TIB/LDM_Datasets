To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Dense Video Captioning" by Vladimir Iashin and Esa Rahtu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**, indicating that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional context or details about the dataset. The authors mention that their model is assessed using the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**, which is a standard benchmark for dense video captioning tasks. This confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**. They note that it contains approximately 20,000 videos from YouTube, split into training, validation, and testing sets. Each video has an average of 3.65 temporally localized captions, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ActivityNet Captions dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Ranjay Krishna, Kenji Hata, Frederic Ren, Li Fei-Fei, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *Dense-captioning events in videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Confirming the dataset's significance in the experiments section.
3. Extracting detailed information about the dataset from the experiments section.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

With this information, I can now create a comprehensive entry for the **ActivityNet Captions dataset** that includes its name, description, and citation.
