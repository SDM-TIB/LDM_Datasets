To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Neural Machine Translation: Can Linguistic Hierarchies Help?" by Fahimeh Saleh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **TED dataset with 53 languages**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** to find more details about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on a **parallel corpus from TED talks transcripts**, which is a significant dataset for their multilingual neural machine translation experiments.

I will also check the **data section** for any additional details about the TED dataset. The paper provides a table (Table 11) that lists the languages included in the TED dataset along with their respective training sizes in terms of the number of sentences. This table confirms that the dataset consists of 53 languages, which is essential for understanding the scope of their experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the TED dataset as mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **TED dataset**: 
  > Mauro Cettolo, Christian Girardi, and Marcello Federico. *WIT3: Web Inventory of Transcribed and Translated Talks*. In Conference of European Association for Machine Translation, pages 261â€“268, 2012.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Dataset Name**: TED dataset
   - **Description**: A parallel corpus consisting of transcripts and translations of TED talks in 53 languages.
   - **Languages Included**: Kazakh, Belarusian, Bengali, Basque, Malay, Bosnian, Azerbaijani, Urdu, Tamli, Mongolian, Marathi, Galician, Kurdish, Estonian, Georgian, Bokmal, Hindi, Slovenian, Armenian, Burmese, Finnish, Macedonian, Lithuanian, Albanian, Danish, Swedish, Slovak, Indonesian, Czech, Ukrainian, Croatian, Greek, Serbian, Hungarian, Persian, German, Japanese, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Polish, Romanian, Turkish, Chinese, Spanish, and others.
   - **Training Size**: Varies by language, with the number of sentences provided in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
