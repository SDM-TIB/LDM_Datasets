To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging a Joint of Phenotypic and Genetic Features on Cancer Patient Subgrouping" by David Oniani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using **Mayo Clinic electronic health records (EHRs)** and **genetic test reports**, which indicates that these are key datasets.

In the **Materials section**, the authors specify that they collected a cancer patient cohort consisting of **794 patients** with accessible Mayo Clinic EHRs and genetic test reports. They detail the types of cancer included in this cohort, which suggests that the dataset is comprehensive and well-defined.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of how the data was processed or utilized in the **Methods section**. The authors describe extracting phenotypic features from EHRs and collecting genetic features from **FoundationOne CDx genetic test reports**. This indicates that both the EHRs and the genetic test reports are significant datasets used in their analysis.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their classification and clustering methods based on the datasets, further confirming their importance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **Mayo Clinic EHRs**: While the paper does not provide a specific citation for the EHRs, it is understood that these are internal records from the Mayo Clinic, and thus do not have a formal citation. However, I will note that they are a proprietary dataset used for research.

2. **FoundationOne CDx genetic test reports**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset either, but it is a well-known commercial product. I will note that it is a proprietary dataset used for genetic testing in cancer patients.

After identifying these datasets, I will summarize them as follows:

- **Dataset 1**: Mayo Clinic Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
  - Description: A dataset containing clinical data from 794 cancer patients, including phenotypic features extracted from clinical notes and radiology reports.
  - Citation: Not applicable (internal dataset).

- **Dataset 2**: FoundationOne CDx Genetic Test Reports
  - Description: A dataset containing genetic test results for cancer patients, providing information on genomic findings within hundreds of cancer-related genes.
  - Citation: Not applicable (commercial product).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper along with their relevant details.
