To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The role of noise in denoising models for anomaly detection in medical images" by Antanas Kascenas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their findings on two real-world datasets related to medical imaging, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section (Section 4)**, as this is where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **BraTS Challenge Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating anomaly detection performance on brain tumor segmentation. It includes various MRI modalities from multiple institutions. The authors provide details about how they split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, as well as preprocessing steps.

2. **iCAIRD GG&C NHS Dataset**: This dataset consists of head CT scans from patients diagnosed with strokes. The authors describe how the data was collected, the number of patients and scans, and the ethical approval obtained for using this data.

Additionally, they mention a third dataset, **CQ500**, which is used for qualitative evaluation but does not contain voxel-level ground truth.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **BraTS Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
> Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al. (2014). The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (BraTS). *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(1993-2024).

For the **iCAIRD GG&C NHS Dataset**, the citation is:
> Wilde, K., Anderson, L., Boyle, M., Pinder, A., Weir, A., et al. (2022). Introducing a new Trusted Research Environment â€“ the Safe Haven Artificial Platform (SHAIP). *International Journal of Population Data Science*, 7.

The **CQ500 dataset** citation is:
> Chilamkurthy, S., Ghosh, R., Tanamala, S., Biviji, M., Campeau, N.G., Venugopal, V.K., Mahajan, V., Rao, P., Warier, P. (2018). Deep learning algorithms for detection of critical findings in head CT scans: a retrospective study. *The Lancet*, 392(2388-2396).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
