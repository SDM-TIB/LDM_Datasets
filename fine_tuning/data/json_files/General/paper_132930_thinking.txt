To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Inference for GARCH-family Models" by Martin Magris and Alexandros Iosifidis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Variational Inference (VI) in econometrics and finance, particularly focusing on GARCH-family models. I will look for any references to specific datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, particularly the subsection labeled **Data**. Here, the authors mention that they used daily close-to-close log returns for the constituents of the S&P 500 index, covering 1383 trading days from January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2023. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also note that they mention using **488 stocks** from the S&P 500 index, as some constituents changed and their time series are incomplete. This detail is important for understanding the scope of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is derived from the S&P 500 index, I will note that the dataset itself may not have a formal citation like a published dataset would. Instead, I will acknowledge the source of the data as the S&P 500 index.

The relevant citation for the paper itself is:
> Martin Magris and Alexandros Iosifidis. *Variational Inference for GARCH-family Models*. Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.

In summary, I will compile the dataset information as follows:

1. **S&P 500 Index Dataset**: Daily close-to-close log returns for the constituents of the S&P 500 index, covering 1383 trading days from January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2023, with a total of 488 stocks.

Now, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for datasets, ensuring that I include the necessary citations and details.
