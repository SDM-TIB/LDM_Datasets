To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decision support system for Forest fire management using Ontology with Big Data and LLMs" by Ritesh Chandra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that typically contain detailed descriptions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of various fire weather indices and the role of sensor networks in gathering climatic data. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets here.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3.2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors describe a dataset that includes spatial, temporal, and meteorological data crucial for analyzing and predicting forest fire behavior in Montesinho Park, Portugal. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its components such as spatial coordinates, temporal details, and meteorological variables.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Montesinho Park Dataset**: This dataset encompasses spatial, temporal, and meteorological data crucial for analyzing and predicting forest fire behavior. It includes precise spatial coordinates, temporal details highlighting seasonal and weekly trends in fire occurrences, and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall. The target variable is the burned area, which quantifies the extent of forest damage.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** for this dataset in the **References section**. The authors mention that the dataset is derived from a website, specifically referencing Montesinho Park. However, they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the information available:

- For the **Montesinho Park Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Montesinho Natural Park. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://amontesinho.pt/en/the-region/montesinho-natural-park/

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
