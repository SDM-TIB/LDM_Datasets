To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decomposing Word Embedding with the Capsule Network" by Xin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the CapsDecE2S model was evaluated on two public corpora: **Word-in-Context** and **English all-words Word Sense Disambiguation**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Word-in-Context (WiC) Dataset**: This dataset is described as a benchmark for evaluating context-sensitive word embeddings, with a training set of 5.4K pairs, a development set of 0.63K, and a test set of 1.4K. 

2. **English all-words Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) Datasets**: The paper lists several datasets under this category, including:
   - **Senseval-2 (SE2)**
   - **Senseval-3 (SE3)**
   - **SemEval-07 task 17 (SE07)**
   - **SemEval-13 task 12 (SE13)**
   - **SemEval-15 task 13 (SE15)**

In the experiments section, the authors confirm that these datasets were used to evaluate the performance of their proposed model, which reinforces their significance.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Word-in-Context (WiC) Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **SemEval-13 task 12 (SE13)** dataset, the citation is:

In Second Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics (*SEM), Volume 2: Proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2013), Association for Computational Linguistics, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013, pp. 222–231.

- For the **SemEval-15 task 13 (SE15)** dataset, the citation is:
  > D. Jurgens, R. Navigli. *SemEval-2015 task 13: Multilingual all-words sense disambiguation and entity linking*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
