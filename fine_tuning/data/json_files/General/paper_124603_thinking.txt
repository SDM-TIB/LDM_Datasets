To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixed Autoencoder for Self-supervised Visual Representation Learning" by Kai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed Mixed Autoencoder (MixedAE) on various downstream tasks, specifically mentioning improvements on **ImageNet-1K**, **ADE20K**, and **COCO** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were utilized. In Section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention that they evaluate their model on **ImageNet-1K** for image classification, **ADE20K** for semantic segmentation, and **COCO** for object detection and instance segmentation. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is widely known and used for image classification tasks. It contains over 1 million images across 1,000 categories.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and contains images annotated with object and stuff categories. It is a standard benchmark in the field of scene understanding.

3. **COCO**: The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is used for object detection and instance segmentation. It contains images with complex scenes and annotations for object instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Tete Xiao, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20K dataset*. In International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 2019.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
