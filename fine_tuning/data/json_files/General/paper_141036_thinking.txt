To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ModeTv2: GPU-accelerated Motion Decomposition Transformer for Pairwise Optimization in Medical Image Registration" by Haiqiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "two public brain MRI datasets and one abdominal CT dataset," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses the datasets in detail. In this case, the **Experiments section (4.1)** explicitly lists the datasets used:

1. **LPBA Dataset**: This dataset contains 40 brain MRI volumes, each with 54 manually labeled regions of interest (ROIs). The authors mention that 30 volumes were used for training and 10 for testing.

2. **Mindboggle Dataset**: This dataset consists of brain MRI volumes that have been affinely aligned to mni152, containing 62 manually labeled ROIs. The authors used 42 volumes for training and 20 for testing.

3. **Abdomen CT Dataset**: This dataset includes CT volumes with annotations for four organs. The authors specify that 35 volumes were used for training and 8 for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LPBA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shattuck, D.W., Mirza, M., Adisetiyo, V., Hojatkashani, C., Salamon, G., Narr, K.L., Poldrack, R.A., Bilder, R.M., Toga, A.W. (2008). Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures. *NeuroImage*, 39(3), 1064-1080.

- For the **Mindboggle Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Klein, A., Tourville, J. (2012). 101 labeled brain images and a consistent human cortical labeling protocol. *Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 6, 171.

- For the **Abdomen CT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Abdomen CT dataset. Retrieved from https://learn2reg.grand-challenge.org/.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective details and citations. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
