To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards physiology-informed data augmentation for EEG-based BCIs" by Oleksandr Zlatov and Benjamin Blankertz, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for training data in EEG-based BCIs and hints at the use of existing datasets for evaluation. However, it does not specify any dataset names.

Next, I will examine the **Material and Methods** section, particularly subsection 2.1, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention a "large-scale BCI study with motor imagery as control paradigm" and reference several papers analyzing this dataset. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized, but I need to find its name and details.

In subsection 2.1, the authors state that the study involved **80 participants** and that they recorded EEG data during motor imagery tasks. They also mention that the data has been analyzed in previous studies, which suggests that this dataset is well-documented in the literature.

To find the exact citation for this dataset, I will look at the **References section**. The authors reference several papers, including:

- **Blankertz et al., 2010**: This paper discusses neurophysiological predictors of SMR-based BCI performance and is likely related to the dataset used in the current study. The citation is:
  > Blankertz, B., Sannelli, C., Halder, S., Hammer, E. M., Kübler, A., Müller, K.-R., Curio, G., and Dickhaus, T. (2010). Neurophysiological predictor of SMR-based BCI performance. *Neuroimage*, 51(4):1303–1309.

Next, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors discuss various methods and approaches, but they primarily focus on the augmentation of the existing dataset rather than introducing new datasets. Therefore, I will conclude that the main dataset referenced is the one analyzed in the Blankertz et al. (2010) paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset used in the study. The dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Motor Imagery Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 80 participants performing motor imagery tasks, specifically left-hand and right-hand imagery. The data has been previously analyzed in various studies, including the one by Blankertz et al. (2010).

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Blankertz, B., Sannelli, C., Halder, S., Hammer, E. M., Kübler, A., Müller, K.-R., Curio, G., and Dickhaus, T. (2010). Neurophysiological predictor of SMR-based BCI performance. *Neuroimage*, 51(4):1303–1309.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
