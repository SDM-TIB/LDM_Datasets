To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Folded Attention for 3D Medical Image Reconstruction and Segmentation" by Hang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions two tasks: quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In the **experimental results** section, the authors describe their experiments on MS lesion segmentation and QSM reconstruction, which indicates that specific datasets were used for these tasks.

Upon examining the text, I find that the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **MS Lesion Segmentation Dataset**: The authors state that they used a dataset consisting of 30 MR images acquired from a 3.0 T GE scanner, with images from T1, T2, and T2-FLAIR sequences. They also mention that golden masks were traced by a neural radiologist.

2. **COSMOS Dataset**: For the QSM task, the authors mention using COSMOS data, which was acquired from 6 healthy subjects scanned with 5 brain orientations using a 3.0T GE scanner. They provide details about the acquisition matrix and voxel size.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MS Lesion Segmentation Dataset**, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but they reference the work of Myronenko (2018) for MRI brain tumor segmentation, which may be relevant for context.

- For the **COSMOS Dataset**, the authors cite the original paper describing the COSMOS technique:
  > Liu, T.; Spincemaille, P.; De Rochefort, L.; Kressler, B.; and Wang, Y. 2009. *Calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling (COSMOS): a method for conditioning the inverse problem from measured magnetic field map to susceptibility source image in MRI*. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: An Official Journal of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 61(1):196â€“204.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

In summary, I have identified two datasets used in the paper, along with their respective citations, and I am now ready to format this information appropriately for further processing.
