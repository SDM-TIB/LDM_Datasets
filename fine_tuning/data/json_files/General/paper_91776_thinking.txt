To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconstructing Undersampled Photoacoustic Microscopy Images using Deep Learning" by Anthony DiSpirito III et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the study involves reconstructing undersampled photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) images, which suggests that there may be datasets related to PAM images.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, particularly the **Data Preparation** subsection, where the authors describe their dataset. They mention that their dataset consists of in vivo mouse brain microvasculature data acquired by the Photoacoustic Imaging Lab at Duke University. This is a clear indication of a specific dataset being used.

In the **Data Preparation** section, the authors specify that their dataset contains **292 maximum-amplitude-projection images** of mouse brain vasculature, all acquired at a wavelength of 532 nm. They also describe the preprocessing steps taken, such as thresholding and noise removal, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

I will also check the **Results section** to see if the authors reference any additional datasets or provide further details about the dataset used in their experiments. However, it appears that the primary dataset is the one mentioned in the Methods section.

Finally, I will look at the **Data and Code Availability** section, where the authors state that the mouse brain microvasculature datasets used for this study are downloadable at the Open Science Framework (OSF). This is crucial information as it provides a source for accessing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- **Mouse Brain Microvasculature Dataset**: 
  > DiSpirito III, A., Li, D., Vu, T., Chen, M., Zhang, D., Luo, J., Horstmeyer, R., & Yao, J. (2020). *Reconstructing Undersampled Photoacoustic Microscopy Images using Deep Learning*. Available at Open Science Framework: [https://osf.io/](https://osf.io/) (specific link to be provided in the paper).

With this information, I can now create a structured entry for the dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their sources for future reference or analysis.
