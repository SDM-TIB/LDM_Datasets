To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Find Missing Video Frames with Synthetic Data Augmentation: A General Framework and Application in Generating Thermal Images Using RGB Cameras" by Mathias Viborg Andersen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of generative models to create synthetic thermal imagery, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of missing data due to sensor frame rate mismatches and the need for accurate driver state monitoring. This indicates that they likely used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset." Here, the authors describe a dataset that consists of thermal and RGB images captured from 17 subjects seated in a simulated driver's seat. They mention that the RGB images are captured at approximately 30 frames per second, while the thermal images are captured at less than 9 frames per second. This section provides crucial details about the dataset used in their study.

The authors also discuss the generation of synthetic data to augment their dataset, which implies that they may have used additional datasets or methods to create the synthetic images. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one they collected from the subjects.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors present results comparing different input styles and training methods, which further confirms the use of the dataset they described earlier.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not explicitly cite external datasets, but it does reference other works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset of Thermal and RGB Images**: This dataset consists of images captured from 17 subjects in a simulated driving environment, including various perspectives (thermal, front, overhead, profile, and tablet orientations). The dataset is designed to facilitate the training of models for driver state estimation.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors for their research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations as needed.
