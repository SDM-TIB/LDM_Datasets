To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Programmable and Customized Intelligence for Traffic Steering in 5G Networks Using Open RAN Architectures" by Andrea Lacava et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights that the authors developed a framework (ns-O-RAN) for automated data collection and testing of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In the introduction, the authors state that their TS xApp was trained with more than **40 million data points** collected by ns-O-RAN. This indicates a significant dataset, but I need to find more specific details about its origin and structure.

In the **system design and architecture** section, the authors describe how ns-O-RAN integrates a real-world near-RT RIC with a simulated environment on ns-3. They mention that this framework allows for the collection of **RAN Key Performance Metrics (KPMs)** and other data, which are crucial for training their models. I will note that these KPMs are part of the dataset used for training.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or provide additional context about the data collection process. If there are any references to existing datasets or benchmarks used in their experiments, I will document those as well.

After gathering all relevant information, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to specific datasets or papers that describe datasets, I will ensure to include those citations.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include:
1. The name of the dataset (e.g., "ns-O-RAN dataset").
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its size and what it contains (e.g., "40 million data points collected for training the TS xApp").
3. The full citation for the dataset or the relevant paper that describes it.

Finally, I will ensure that all entries are formatted correctly and ready for downstream processing or review.
