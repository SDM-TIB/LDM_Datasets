To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BJTU-WeChat’s Systems for the WMT22 Chat Translation Task" by Yunlong Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the submission to the WMT’22 chat translation task, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the task and methods without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results section** (section 4) where datasets are typically detailed. In section 4.2, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. They mention the following datasets:

1. **BConTrasT Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used for speaker-aware in-domain data generation. It is associated with the WMT20 chat translation task and is crucial for their methodology.

2. **Taskmaster-1 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the source for generating speaker-aware in-domain data. It is used in conjunction with the BConTrasT dataset to enhance the training process.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BConTrasT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Amin Farajian, António V. Lopes, André F. T. Martins, Sameen Maruf, and Gholamreza Haffari. *Findings of the WMT 2020 shared task on chat translation*. In Proceedings of WMT, pages 65–75, 2020.

- For the **Taskmaster-1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bill Byrne, Karthik Krishnamoorthi, Chinnadhurai Sankar, Arvind Neelakantan, Ben Goodrich, Daniel Duckworth, Semih Yavuz, Amit Dubey, Kyu-Young Kim, and Andy Cedilnik. *Taskmaster-1: Toward a realistic and diverse dialog dataset*. In Proceedings of EMNLP-IJCNLP, pages 4516–4525, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
