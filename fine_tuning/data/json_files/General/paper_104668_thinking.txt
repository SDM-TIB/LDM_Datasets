To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SignBERT: Pre-Training of Hand-Model-Aware Representation for Sign Language Recognition" by Hezhen Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on **four public benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **NMFs-CSL**: This dataset is described as the most challenging Chinese sign language dataset, containing 1,067 words, with 25,608 training samples and 6,402 testing samples.

2. **SLR500**: This dataset consists of 500 daily words with a total of 125,000 recording samples performed by 50 signers, with 90,000 samples for training and 35,000 for testing.

3. **MSASL**: An American sign language dataset that includes a vocabulary size of 1,000, with 25,513 samples for training, validation, and testing.

4. **WLASL**: Another ASL dataset with a vocabulary of 2,000 words and 21,083 samples, which also has subsets (WLASL100 and WLASL300).

In addition, the authors mention two other datasets, **STB** and **HANDS17**, which provide 2D hand joint annotations and are used to validate the feasibility of their proposed framework.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.
