To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Helps Transformers Recognize Conversational Structure? Importance of Context, Punctuation, and Labels in Dialog Act Recognition" by Piotr Zelasko et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved strong results on the **Switchboard Dialog Act** and **Meeting Recorder Dialog Act** corpora, suggesting that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **related work section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In **section 2.1**, they describe the **Switchboard Dialog Act (SWDA)** dataset, which consists of telephone conversations that have been manually segmented into turns and utterances. The authors mention that it contains about 1.4 million words and uses the DAMSL labeling scheme.

In **section 2.2**, the authors discuss the **Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA)** dataset, which comprises 75 meetings with a total of approximately 850,000 words. They note that the dialog act labeling scheme for MRDA overlaps with SWDA but is distinct.

To confirm the datasets used in their experiments, I will check the **experiments section** where they mention using both SWDA and MRDA for their evaluations. This reinforces that these datasets are indeed the focus of their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section**:

1. For the **Switchboard Dialog Act (SWDA)**, the citation is:
   > Dan Jurafsky, Elizabeth Shriberg, and Debra Bicaca. *Switchboard SWBD-DAMSL Labeling Project Coderâ€™s Manual*. 1997.

2. For the **Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA)**, the citation is:
   > Elizabeth Shriberg, Raj Dhillon, Sonali Bhagat, Jeremy Ang, and Hannah Carvey. *The ICSI Meeting Recorder Dialog Act (MRDA) Corpus*. Technical report, International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, CA, 2004.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
