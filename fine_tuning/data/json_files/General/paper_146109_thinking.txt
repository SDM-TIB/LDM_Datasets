To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data-Centric Perspective on Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Tabular Data" by Andrej Tschalzev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors selected **10 relevant datasets from Kaggle competitions**, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (A Data-Centric Evaluation Framework for Tabular Machine Learning)**, where the authors describe their evaluation framework. In this section, they mention a **table summarizing the main properties of the included datasets**. I will look for this table, as it will likely contain the names and characteristics of the datasets.

Upon locating **Table 1**, I will extract the names of the datasets listed, which include:

1. **Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing (MBGM)**
2. **Santander Value Prediction Challenge (SVPC)**
3. **Amazon Employee Access Challenge (AEAC)**
4. **Otto Group Product Classification Challenge (OGPCC)**
5. **Santander Customer Satisfaction (SCS)**
6. **BNP Paribas Cardif Claims Management (BPCCM)**
7. **Santander Customer Transaction Prediction (SCTP)**
8. **HQC (HQC)**
9. **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (IFD)**
10. **Porto Seguro Safe Driver Prediction (PSSDP)**

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The authors typically provide citations for the competitions or datasets they reference, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, I will look for citations like:

- For **Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing**, the citation might be:
  > Alexander Novy, et al. *Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing*. Kaggle Competition, 2017.

- For **Santander Value Prediction Challenge**, the citation might be:
  > Ben Hamner, et al. *Santander Value Prediction Challenge*. Kaggle Competition, 2016.

I will continue this process for each dataset, ensuring that I accurately capture the citation format used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format, ready for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I do not miss any important details and that I provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the research paper.
