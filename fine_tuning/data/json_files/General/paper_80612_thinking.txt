To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building Program Vector Representations for Deep Learning" by Lili Mou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their learned vector representations and that they publish all datasets, source codes, and learned representations on their project website. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental results in Section V, where they mention using a dataset from an online Open Judge (OJ) system for program classification tasks. This is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper states that the dataset used for the program classification task comes from an online Open Judge system, but it does not provide a detailed citation in the text. Therefore, I will need to look up the Open Judge system to find the appropriate citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details as follows:

1. **Open Judge Dataset**: This dataset consists of source codes submitted by students to an online platform for programming problems. The authors mention that they selected four problems for their classification task, but specific details about the dataset (like the number of samples or types of problems) are not provided in the paper.

Next, I will search for the citation for the Open Judge system. If I find a relevant paper or documentation that describes the Open Judge system, I will include that citation.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for any datasets mentioned, including the Open Judge system, and prepare to format this information according to the required structure.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section or mentions in the experiments section.
3. Identify the Open Judge dataset and gather details.
4. Search for the citation of the Open Judge system.
5. Compile the dataset information and citations for final output.
