To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Relatedness Based Re-ranker for Text Spotting" by Ahmed Sabir et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a benchmark dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset and Visual Context Extraction)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they specifically mention the **COCO-text dataset**, which is based on Microsoft COCO. The authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of images and text instances, which is crucial for understanding its scope and application.

In this section, the authors state:
- **COCO-text Dataset**: This dataset consists of 63,686 images and 173,589 text instances. It is used for text spotting in natural images and does not include visual context information, which the authors supplement with additional classifiers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO-text dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Veit, A., Matera, T., Neumann, L., Matas, J., & Belongie, S. (2016). *Coco-text: text detection and recognition in natural images*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1601.07140.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets explicitly in the paper, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citation, into a structured format for further use.
