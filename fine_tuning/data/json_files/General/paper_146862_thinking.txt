To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ContextualStory: Consistent Visual Storytelling with Spatially-Enhanced and Storyline Context" by Sixiao Zheng and Yanwei Fu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks," indicating that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors provide a description of both datasets:

1. **PororoSV**: This dataset contains 10,191 training samples, 2,334 validation samples, and 2,208 test samples. Each sample consists of a sequence of 5 frames paired with corresponding 5 sentences, featuring 9 main characters.

2. **FlintstonesSV**: This dataset includes 20,132 training samples, 2,071 validation samples, and 2,309 test samples. Similar to PororoSV, each sample consists of a sequence of 5 frames paired with corresponding 5 sentences, featuring 7 main characters.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PororoSV**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Gan, Z., Shen, Y., Liu, J., Cheng, Y., Wu, Y., Carin, L., Carlson, D., and Gao, J. (2019). *StoryGAN: A Sequential Conditional GAN for Story Visualization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 6329–6338.

- For **FlintstonesSV**, the citation is:
  > Gupta, T., Schwenk, D., Farhadi, A., Hoiem, D., and Kembhavi, A. (2018). *Imagine This! Scripts to Compositions to Videos*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 598–613.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the necessary information about the datasets used in the research paper.
