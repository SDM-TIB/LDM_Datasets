To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ROAR: Reinforcing Original to Augmented Data Ratio Dynamics for Wav2Vec2.0 Based ASR" by Vishwanath Pratap Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using the **LibriSpeech dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Librispeech corpus**. They describe using four training subsets: 10 minutes, 1 hour, 10 hours, and 100 hours of data. This section provides the necessary details about the dataset used for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Librispeech dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proc. ICASSP, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Librispeech dataset**, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its various splits as mentioned in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear communication of the dataset's relevance and origin in the context of the research conducted.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Librispeech dataset** and ensure that it is ready for any further processing or review.
