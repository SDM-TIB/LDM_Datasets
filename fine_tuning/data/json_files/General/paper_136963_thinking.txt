To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FerKD: Surgical Label Adaptation for Efficient Distillation" by Zhiqiang Shen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets mentioned in the text, along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on **ImageNet-1K**, which suggests that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets utilized. In section 4, titled "ImageNet Experiments," the authors clearly state that they conducted training on the **ImageNet-1K (IN1K)** training set and report the top-1 validation accuracy. This indicates that ImageNet-1K is a primary dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also reference the **COCO dataset** for object detection and segmentation tasks, as seen in section 5, where they evaluate their method's performance on COCO using models pre-trained on ImageNet-1K.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ImageNet-1K**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **COCO dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
