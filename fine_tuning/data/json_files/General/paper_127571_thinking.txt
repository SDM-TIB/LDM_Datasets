To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalizing Adam To Manifolds For Efficiently Training Transformers" by Benedikt Brantner, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, but the introduction discusses the application of the Adam optimizer and mentions the use of specific datasets in the context of training neural networks. I will look for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will review **section 4 (Numerical Example: the Transformer)**, as this section is likely to contain information about datasets used for training the transformer model. Here, the author mentions that the neural networks are trained on the **MNIST dataset**. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, consisting of handwritten digit images.

In this section, the author describes how the MNIST dataset is split into training and test data, with specific details about the number of labeled images. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed used in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Li Deng. *The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research*. IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 29(6):141â€“142, 2012.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digit images, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
