To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shortcut Matrix Product States and its applications" by Zhuan Li and Pan Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their proposed method using extensive numerical experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions. In this paper, the authors refer to several applications, including function fitting, partition function calculation of the 2-D Ising model, and generative modeling of handwritten digits. I will pay close attention to any datasets associated with these applications.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is used for unsupervised generative modeling of handwritten digits. It consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **2-D Ising Model**: While not a traditional dataset, the authors refer to using a probability tensor network for the 2-D Ising model, which is a well-known model in statistical mechanics. The authors compute the partition function using this model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **2-D Ising Model**, while it is a theoretical model rather than a dataset, the authors reference the original work related to the model:
  > Lars Onsager. *Crystal statistics. I. A two-dimensional model with an order-disorder transition*. Physical Review, 65(117), 1944.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference or processing.
