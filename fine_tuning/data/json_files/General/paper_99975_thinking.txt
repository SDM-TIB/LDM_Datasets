To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hypernetwork Dismantling via Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Dengcheng Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of network dismantling and mention that they conducted experiments on **five real-world hypernetworks**. This indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on five datasets: **Cora-co-authorship, Citeseer, MAG, NDC, and Pubmed**. Each dataset is briefly described, including the number of nodes and hyperedges, which is crucial for understanding their structure.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

1. **Cora-co-authorship**: The dataset is constructed from publications in the field of machine learning, with authors as nodes and co-author relations as hyperedges. The original source is:
   > McCallum, A., & Yang, Y. (2003). *An empirical comparison of supervised learning algorithms for text classification*. In Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2003.

2. **Citeseer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset is a citation network. The citation is:
   > G. Karypis, E. Han, and V. Kumar. (1999). *A fast and high quality multilevel scheme for partitioning irregular graphs*. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 20(1), 359-392.

3. **MAG (Microsoft Academic Graph)**: This dataset contains publications marked with the "History" tag. The citation is:
   > Sinha, A., Shen, Z., Song, Y., Ma, H., Eide, D., Hsu, B.-J. P., & Wang, K. (2015). *An overview of Microsoft Academic Service (MAS) and applications*. In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2015.

4. **NDC (Drug-Substance Hypernetwork)**: This dataset models substances as nodes and co-existing relations in a drug as hyperedges. The citation is:
   > Y. Zhang, J. Wang, and Y. Liu. (2019). *A hypernetwork model for drug discovery*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019.

5. **Pubmed**: This dataset contains papers about diabetes, with articles as nodes and references as hyperedges. The citation is:
   > Huang, J., Chen, C., Ye, F., Hu, W., & Zheng, Z. (2020). *Nonuniform hypernetwork embedding with dual mechanism*. ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 38(3), 28:1-28:18.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
