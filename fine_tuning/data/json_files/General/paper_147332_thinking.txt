To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KWT-Tiny: RISC-V Accelerated, Embedded Keyword Spotting Transformer" by Aness Al-Qawlaq et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **background and results sections** to see if the authors discuss any datasets in detail. In particular, I will look for mentions of datasets used for training or testing the KWT-Tiny model.

In the **background section**, the authors mention that the KWT model achieved 98.6% accuracy on the **Google Speech Commands (GSC) dataset**. This indicates that the GSC dataset is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to confirm the datasets used and to find their full citations. The references section is particularly important as it will provide the necessary bibliographic details.

From my reading, I identify the following dataset:

1. **Google Speech Commands (GSC) Dataset**: This dataset is used to evaluate the KWT-Tiny model's performance. It consists of audio samples for keyword spotting tasks.

Now, I will look up the full citation for the Google Speech Commands dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Warden, P. (2018). *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. [online] Available at: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz [Accessed 4 Feb. 2024].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately document the datasets referenced in the paper.
