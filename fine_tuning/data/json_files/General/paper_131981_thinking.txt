To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images Driven by Transformer" by Gongyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed GeleNet outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods." This indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets. In the section labeled **IV. Experiments**, the authors state that they conducted experiments on three datasets: **ORSI-SOD**, **EORSSD**, and **ORSI-4199**. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

1. **ORSI-SOD Dataset**: This dataset is described as the first public dataset for ORSI-SOD, containing 800 images with corresponding pixel-level ground truths. It is specified that 600 images are used for training and 200 for testing.

2. **EORSSD Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,000 images and corresponding ground truths, with 1,400 images for training and 600 for testing.

3. **ORSI-4199 Dataset**: This is noted as the largest dataset for ORSI-SOD, comprising 4,199 images and corresponding ground truths, with 2,000 images for training and 2,199 for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **ORSI-SOD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, G., Liu, Z., & Ling, H. (2021). "Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, 3528-3542.

- For the **EORSSD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Q., et al. (2021). "Dense Attention Fluid Network for Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 30, 1305-1317.

- For the **ORSI-4199 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tu, Z., et al. (2022). "ORSI Salient Object Detection via Multiscale Joint Region and Boundary Model." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 60, 1-13.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
