To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Optimization with Distributed Features and Non-Smooth Objective Functions" by Cristiano Gratton et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of distributed learning and mention various applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to look for any datasets used in their simulations.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. If the authors describe their experimental setup, they may mention specific datasets, including their characteristics and sizes.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to note the original papers or sources for those datasets.

If I find any datasets, I will document the following for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The title or name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details such as size, number of features, or specific characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "UCI Machine Learning Repository," I would look up the full citation for that dataset and include it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
