To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster-aware Semi-supervised Learning: Relational Knowledge Distillation Provably Learns Clustering" by Yijun Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics such as the number of samples, classes, or any unique features of the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss **data collection or experimental setup**, as these often contain detailed information about the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I will look for the original citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.
3. The full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all the information is clearly organized and ready for presentation or further analysis. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
