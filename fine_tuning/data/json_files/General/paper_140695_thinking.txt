To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADAMER-CTC: Connectionist Temporal Classification with Adaptive Maximum Entropy Regularization for Automatic Speech Recognition" by SooHwan Eom et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **LibriSpeech corpus**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention the **LibriSpeech corpus** as the dataset for both training and evaluation. They describe the specific subsets used: the **train-960 subset** for training, which contains 460 hours of clean speech and 500 hours of noisy speech data, and the **dev-clean**, **test-clean**, and **test-other** subsets for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LibriSpeech corpus. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **LibriSpeech corpus**:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will only create an entry for the **LibriSpeech corpus**.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
