To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can GPT Models Follow Human Summarization Guidelines? Evaluating ChatGPT and GPT-4 for Dialogue Summarization" by Yongxin Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves two datasets: **DialogSum** and **DECODA**, which are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **DialogSum**: This dataset consists of social conversations and is divided into training, validation, and test splits with 12,460, 1,500, and 500 samples, respectively. It was used in a challenge that allows for comparison of results.

2. **DECODA**: This dataset is a call-center conversation corpus collected from the RATP (Paris public transport authority). It includes 100 conversations in the test set, with 212 synopses, and was proposed as a pilot task at Multiling 2015.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **DialogSum**, the citation is:
  > Yulong Chen, Yang Liu, Liang Chen, and Yue Zhang. *DialogSum: A real-life scenario dialogue summarization dataset*. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL-IJCNLP 2021, pages 5062–5074, Online, August 2021. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi:10.18653/v1/2021.findings-acl.449. URL https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-acl.449.

- For **DECODA**, the citation is:
  > Benoit Favre, Evgeny Stepanov, Jérémy Trione, Frédéric Béchet, and Giuseppe Riccardi. *Call centre conversation summarization: A pilot task at multiling 2015*. In Proceedings of the 16th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue, pages 232–236, Prague, Czech Republic, September 2015. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi:10.18653/v1/W15-4633. URL https://aclanthology.org/W15-4633.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
