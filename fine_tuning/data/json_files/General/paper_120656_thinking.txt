To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When are Lemons Purple? The Concept Association Bias of CLIP" by Yutaro Yamada et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the **Natural-Color Dataset (NCD)**, which is used to demonstrate the Concept Association Bias (CAB) in CLIP. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In the **Methodology section**, the authors describe the NCD in detail, stating that it consists of images of various vegetables and fruits, including lemons, and that they created a total of 494 images for their experiments. This section provides essential information about the dataset's purpose and structure.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset called **Rel3D**, which is used to test part-whole relationships in the context of CAB. This dataset is referenced in the section discussing the experiments related to part-whole recognition.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Natural-Color Dataset (NCD)**, the citation is:
   > Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Tahir, Chongyi Li, Ajmal Mian, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, and Abdul Wahab Muzaffar. *Image Colorization: A Survey and Dataset*. 2021.

2. For the **Rel3D dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ankit Goyal, Kaiyu Yang, Dawei Yang, and Jia Deng. *Rel3D: A Minimally Contrastive Benchmark for Grounding Spatial Relations in 3D*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 33, pages 10514â€“10525, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Natural-Color Dataset (NCD)**: A dataset of vegetables and fruits with a white background, used to investigate color recognition tasks and the Concept Association Bias in CLIP. It includes images of various objects such as lemons, with a total of 494 images created for the experiments.

- **Rel3D Dataset**: A dataset designed to test spatial relationships in 3D scenes, used to explore part-whole relationships in the context of CAB. It consists of images depicting various object pairs with specific spatial arrangements.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its full citation.
