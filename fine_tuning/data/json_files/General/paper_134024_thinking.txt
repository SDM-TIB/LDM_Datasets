To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph-based multimodal multi-lesion DLBCL treatment response prediction from PET images" by Oriane Thiery et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a method evaluated on a **private prospective multicentric dataset of 583 patients**, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their experiments. They mention the **GAINED study (NCT 01659099)**, which enrolled 670 newly diagnosed and untreated DLBCL patients. After filtering, they used 583 samples for their analysis. This section provides key details about the dataset, including the number of patients and the type of data collected (PET images and clinical indicators).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GAINED study. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset if needed. The reference for the GAINED study is:

- Le Gouill, S., Ghesquières, H., Oberic, L., Morschhauser, F., Tilly, H., Ribrag, V., Lamy, T., Thieblemont, C., Maisonneuve, H., Gressin, R., Bouhabdallah, K., Haioun, C., Damaj, G., Fornecker, L., Bouhabdallah, R., Feugier, P., Sibon, D., Cartron, G., Bonnet, C., André, M., Chartier, L., Ruminy, P., Kraeber-Bodéré, F., Bodet-Milin, C., Berriolo-Riedinger, A., Brière, J., Jais, J.P., Molina, T.J., Itti, E., Casasnovas, R.O. (2021). Obinutuzumab vs rituximab for advanced DLBCL: a PET-guided and randomized phase 3 study by LYSA. *Blood*, 137(17), 2307–2320.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **GAINED Study Dataset**: A private prospective multicentric dataset consisting of 583 patients diagnosed with DLBCL. The dataset includes PET images and clinical indicators such as age, ECOG scale, Ann Arbor stage, and the number of extranodal sites.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper documentation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
