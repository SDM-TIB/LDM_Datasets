To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChatGPT as a mapping assistant: A novel method to enrich maps with generative AI and content derived from street-level photographs" by Levente Juhász et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves using **Mapillary street-level photographs** and **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** data, which suggests that these could be the datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Study setup)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Data sources and preparation)**, where the authors describe the data sources used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they extracted OSM roads with specific tags and matched them with corresponding Mapillary photographs. This confirms that both OSM and Mapillary are indeed datasets utilized in their research.

In **subsection 2.3 (Methodology for suggesting OSM tags)**, the authors detail how they used the OSM data and Mapillary images to generate tagging suggestions. They also mention that the final dataset contains **94 OSM highway features** and their original tags, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will look at the **Data availability section**, which states that the dataset supporting the findings is freely available at a specific DOI link. This is important for providing a complete citation for the dataset.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: 
   > OpenStreetMap contributors. *OpenStreetMap*. https://openstreetmap.org (Accessed: 2023).

2. **Mapillary**: 
   > Mapillary contributors. *Mapillary*. https://mapillary.com (Accessed: 2023).

3. **Dataset from the study**:

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
