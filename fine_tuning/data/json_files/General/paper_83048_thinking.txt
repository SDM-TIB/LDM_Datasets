To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-objective Bayesian optimisation with preferences over objectives" by Majid Abdolshah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **MNIST dataset** in the context of training a neural network with two objectives of minimizing prediction error and prediction time. This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and I will need to document it.

Additionally, the authors reference a dataset related to a **Simple Crash Study**, which is available online. I will need to extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Simple Crash Study Dataset**: The citation for the Simple Crash Study dataset is:
   > Simple Crash Study Dataset. Available at: https://bit.ly/2FWNXQS.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
