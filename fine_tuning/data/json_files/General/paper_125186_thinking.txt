To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Filler Word Detection with Hard Category Mining and Inter-Category Focal Loss" by Zhiyuan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the **PodcastFillers dataset**. This indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors evaluate their method. Here, they explicitly state that they evaluate their proposed method on the **PodcastFillers dataset**. This confirms that this dataset is used for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PodcastFillers dataset**. The reference is listed as follows:
> Ge Zhu, Juan-Pablo Caceres, and Justin Salamon, “Filler word detection and classification: A dataset and benchmark,” in Interspeech. Citeseer, 2022.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my dataset extraction.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **PodcastFillers Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method and is essential for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details regarding the dataset used in the research.
