To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Catalog Phrase Grounding (CPG): Grounding of Product Textual Attributes in Product Images for e-commerce Vision-Language Applications" by Karim Bouyarmane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is trained with **2.3 million image-text pairs synthesized from an e-commerce site**, which indicates a significant dataset used for training. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** or **methodology** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the importance of multimodal understanding and refer to the use of **product image and textual attributes**. However, I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **experimentation and results** section, the authors describe the **product-brand matching dataset**, which consists of **50,000 (product, brand) training pairs per country from 6 countries**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the application of their model. They also mention that the training set is split into 80% for training and 20% for validation, and that they collected **20,000 (product, brand) pairs per country for testing**.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets used, but I can infer the following based on the context:

1. **Image-Text Pairs Dataset**: This dataset is synthesized from an e-commerce site, but no specific citation is provided. It is important to note that this dataset is proprietary to the authors' research and may not have a formal citation.

2. **Product-Brand Matching Dataset**: The authors mention collecting **50,000 (product, brand) pairs per country** from an e-commerce site. Again, no specific citation is provided for this dataset, as it appears to be a custom dataset created for the study.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will document them as follows:

- **Image-Text Pairs Dataset**: Synthesized from an e-commerce site, containing 2.3 million image-text pairs. No formal citation available.

- **Product-Brand Matching Dataset**: Custom dataset with 50,000 (product, brand) pairs per country, collected from an e-commerce site. No formal citation available.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations for the proprietary datasets used in this research.
