To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic ASR Pathways: An Adaptive Masking Approach Towards Efficient Pruning of a Multilingual ASR Model" by Jiamin Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and may reference datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or references to prior work that might include datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in subsection 4.1 titled "Dataset," the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they state that they utilized the **Multilingual Librispeech (MLS)** dataset, which consists of multilingual speech derived from audiobooks. They specify that the dataset includes training audio for four languages: English (EN), French (FR), Italian (IT), and Dutch (NL), along with the respective training audio lengths.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MLS dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> Vineel Pratap, Qiantong Xu, Anuroop Sriram, Gabriel Synnaeve, and Ronan Collobert. *MLS: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Research*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.03411, 2020.

Since the authors do not mention any other datasets in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MLS dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MLS dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
