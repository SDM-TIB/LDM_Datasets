To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAM-DEBLUR: LET SEGMENT ANYTHING BOOST IMAGE DEBLURRING" by Siwei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained on the **RealBlurJ, ReloBlur, and REDS datasets**, indicating that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **GoPro Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,103 training images and 1,111 test images. It is used for training the NAFNet model.
2. **RealBlurJ Dataset**: This dataset contains 980 images and is used to evaluate the model's generalization capabilities.
3. **REDS Dataset**: This dataset comprises 3,000 images and is also used for testing.
4. **ReLoBlur Dataset**: This dataset contains 395 images and is utilized in the experiments.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **GoPro Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seungjun Nah, Tae Hyun Kim, and Kyoung Mu Lee. "Deep multi-scale convolutional neural network for dynamic scene deblurring." In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017, pp. 3883–3891.

- For the **RealBlurJ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jucheol Won, Jaesung Rim, Haeyun Lee, and Sunghyun Cho. "Real-world blur dataset for learning and benchmarking deblurring algorithms." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

- For the **REDS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seungjun Nah, Sungyong Baik, Seokil Hong, Gyeongsik Moon, Sanghyun Son, Radu Timofte, and Kyoung Mu Lee. "Ntire 2019 challenge on video deblurring and super-resolution: Dataset and study." In CVPR Workshops, June 2019.

- For the **ReLoBlur Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haoying Li, Ziran Zhang, Tingting Jiang, Peng Luo, Huajun Feng, and Zhihai Xu. "Real-world deep local motion deblurring." In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2023, vol. 37, pp. 1314–1322.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
