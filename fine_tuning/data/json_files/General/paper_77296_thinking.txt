To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Generalization Method of Partitioned Activation Function for Complex Number" by HyeonSeok Lee and Hyo Seon Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for complex number artificial neural networks (CANN) and reference various problems where complex numbers are applicable. However, they do not mention specific datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and examples sections** where the authors describe their proposed methods and examples of activation functions. Here, they discuss the generalization of existing activation functions like LReLU and SELU but do not provide any datasets used for experiments or validation.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers and theoretical discussions rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any specific datasets for their experiments or validations, as the focus is on theoretical advancements in activation functions rather than empirical results based on datasets.

In conclusion, since no datasets are mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will note that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets, I would have compiled their details and full citations accordingly. However, in this case, I will summarize my findings and confirm that no datasets were identified in the research paper.
