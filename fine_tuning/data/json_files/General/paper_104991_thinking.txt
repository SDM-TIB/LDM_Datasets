To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Training and Inference of Graph Neural Networks with Fast Sampling and Pipelining" by Tim Kaler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report comprehensive experimental results with several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments** section, specifically **section 6 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three benchmark datasets: 

1. **ogbn-arxiv**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks and consists of a graph with 169,343 nodes and 1,166,243 edges. The features are 128-dimensional.

2. **ogbn-products**: Another dataset for node classification, containing 2,449,029 nodes and 62,000,000 edges, with 100-dimensional features.

3. **ogbn-papers100M**: This is the largest dataset mentioned, with 111,059,956 nodes and 1,600,000,000 edges, featuring 128-dimensional attributes.

In the same section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 4) that includes the number of nodes, edges, features, and the training/validation/testing splits for each dataset. This information is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of each dataset's structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the datasets as follows:

- For **ogbn-arxiv**, the citation is:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

- For **ogbn-products**, the citation is the same as above, as it is part of the Open Graph Benchmark.

- For **ogbn-papers100M**, the citation is also the same:
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open graph benchmark: Datasets for machine learning on graphs. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00687*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
