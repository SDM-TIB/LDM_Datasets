To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separation Power of Equivariant Neural Networks" by Marco Pacini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

In this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to equivariant neural networks or any benchmarks used for evaluating the proposed methods. I will note down the following details for each dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.

Now, I will proceed to read through the relevant sections of the paper to extract the datasets and their citations.
