To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How can I choose an explainer? An Application-grounded Evaluation of Post-hoc Explanations" by SÃ©rgio Jesus et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or data sources that are critical to their experiments. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets used for training or testing. This section typically provides insights into the data collection process, sample sizes, and characteristics of the datasets.

The **experiments section** is crucial as it often explicitly states the datasets used in the study. I will look for any subsections that detail the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics that the authors describe.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used real-world data from a fraud detection system, as indicated in the methodology. I will look for specific names of datasets or data sources, such as the training and experiment samples mentioned in the experiments section.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as per academic standards.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for any further processing or review.
