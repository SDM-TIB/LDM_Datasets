To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature-aware Diversified Re-ranking with Disentangled Representations for Relevant Recommendation" by Zihan Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted offline evaluations on a collected dataset, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the context of the recommendation system, hinting at the use of a specific dataset from the KuaiShou app.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this case, section 3.1 explicitly states that the authors constructed a new dataset from the KuaiShou app, detailing how they sampled user interactions and the characteristics of the dataset.

The dataset is described as follows:
- **Dataset from KuaiShou app**: This dataset was created by randomly sampling 0.3 million active users and tracing their logs for 24 hours. It includes nearly 4 million interactions, 0.25 million items, and 0.6 million sessions, with a focus on capturing feature-aware characteristics through item tags.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since this dataset is constructed by the authors themselves and does not reference an external source, I will note that it is an original dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation details. Since the dataset is original and does not have a formal citation, I will indicate that it is a proprietary dataset created for the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for inclusion in the final output.
