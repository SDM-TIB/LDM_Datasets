To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigate Position Bias in Large Language Models via Scaling a Single Dimension" by Yijiong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on several tasks, including **NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA**, **KV retrieval**, **LongBench**, and **timeline reorder tasks**. This indicates that these tasks may involve specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly mention using the **NaturalQuestions** dataset for multi-document QA and the **KV retrieval** dataset. They also refer to the **LongBench** benchmark, which is a comprehensive evaluation framework for long-context understanding.

Now, I will gather full citations for these datasets from the **References** section of the paper:

1. **NaturalQuestions Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Nelson F Liu, Kevin Lin, John Hewitt, Ashwin Paranjape, Michele Bevilacqua, Fabio Petroni, and Percy Liang. *Lost in the middle: How language models use long contexts*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 12:157–173, 2024.

2. **KV Retrieval Dataset**: The citation is the same as the NaturalQuestions dataset since it is referenced in the same context:
   > Nelson F Liu, Kevin Lin, John Hewitt, Ashwin Paranjape, Michele Bevilacqua, Fabio Petroni, and Percy Liang. *Lost in the middle: How language models use long contexts*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 12:157–173, 2024.

3. **LongBench**: The citation is:
   > Yushi Bai, Xin Lv, Jiajie Zhang, Hongchang Lyu, Jiankai Tang, Zhidian Huang, Zhengxiao Du, Xiao Liu, Aohan Zeng, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, and Juanzi Li. *Longbench: A bilingual, multitask benchmark for long context understanding*. ArXiv preprint, abs/2308.14508, 2023.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure to document them clearly, emphasizing the importance of proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
