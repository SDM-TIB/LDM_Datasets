To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Activating the Discriminability of Novel Classes for Few-shot Segmentation" by Dianwen Mei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **PASCAL-5i** and **COCO-20i** datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their evaluation on both datasets, providing details about how they are structured and used in the context of few-shot segmentation. 

In the **experiments section**, they clarify that **PASCAL-5i** is an extension of the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and contains 20 categories divided into 4 splits for training and testing. They also mention that **COCO-20i** is derived from the COCO dataset, containing 80 categories and complex scenes, also divided into 4 splits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **PASCAL-5i**, the citation is:
   > Shaban, A., Bansal, S., Liu, Z., Essa, I., & Boots, B. (2017). One-shot learning for semantic segmentation. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03410*.

2. For **COCO-20i**, the citation is:
   > Nguyen, K., & Todorovic, S. (2019). Feature weighting and boosting for few-shot segmentation. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 622â€“631).

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
