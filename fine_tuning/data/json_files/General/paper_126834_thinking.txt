To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ahead-of-Time P-Tuning" by Daniil Gavrilov and Nikita Balagansky, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on **GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarking datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** to see if there are any additional details about these datasets. The introduction confirms that the authors tested their method on the **GLUE** and **SuperGLUE** datasets, which are widely recognized benchmarks in natural language processing.

I will then proceed to the **experiments section** to gather more specific information about how these datasets were used. The authors mention that they compared their method against various fine-tuning methods on these datasets. They also provide details about the tasks associated with each dataset, which can help in understanding their application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**:
   > Alex Wang, Amapreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. 2018. URL: http://gluebenchmark.com/.

2. **SuperGLUE Benchmark**:
   > Alex Wang, Yada Pruksachatkun, Nikita Nangia, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel Bowman. *SuperGLUE: A Stickier Benchmark for General-Purpose Language Understanding Systems*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, volume 32. Curran Associates, Inc., 2019. URL: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/4496bf24afe7fab6f046bf4923da8de6-Paper.pdf.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
