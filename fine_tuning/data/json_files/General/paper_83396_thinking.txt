To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equivariant Entity Relationship Networks" by Devon Graham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention using two real-world datasets: the **European Soccer database** and the **NHL hockey database**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as the number of instances, features, and the nature of the data.

In the experiments section, the authors describe the **European Soccer database** as containing information for about 11,000 players, 300 teams, and 25,000 matches in European soccer leagues. They extract relations between teams and matches, as well as players and matches, which are crucial for their analysis.

Similarly, the **NHL hockey database** is described as containing information for about 2,212 players, 33 teams, and 11,434 matches in the NHL hockey league. The authors also mention the relations they extract from this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **European Soccer database**, the citation is:
> Dataset retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer

For the **NHL hockey database**, the citation is:
> Dataset retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future use.
