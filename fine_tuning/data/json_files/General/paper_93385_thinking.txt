To extract datasets from the research paper titled "KAPLAN: A 3D Point Descriptor for Shape Completion" by Audrey Richard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that experiments were conducted on public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

In the **implementation details section** (Section 4), the authors mention using **ShapeNet** to create their dataset of input-output pairs. They describe how they generate incomplete and complete versions of point clouds from this dataset. This is a crucial dataset for the experiments, and I need to note its significance.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for **ShapeNet**. The citation is:
> Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository. arXiv preprint 1512.03012.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for **ShapeNet** as it is the primary dataset referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ensuring that all relevant information is included for clarity and completeness.
