To extract datasets from the research paper titled "There Are Many Consistent Explanations of Unlabeled Data: Why You Should Average" by Ben Athiwaratkun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions achieving the best known semi-supervised results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. They provide details about the number of labeled examples used for training, which is crucial for understanding the context of their results.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citations I need to include are:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I follow the required format for documentation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as mentioned above. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the paper.
