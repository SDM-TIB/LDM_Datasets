To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-to-Sequence Automatic Speech Recognition with Word Embedding Regularization and Fused Decoding" by Alexander H. Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "Initial results on LibriSpeech," which indicates that the LibriSpeech dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that experiments were performed on **LibriSpeech** with two different settings: a high resource setting with 460 hours of fully annotated clean speech and a low resource setting with 100 hours of annotated clean speech. This confirms that LibriSpeech is the primary dataset used in their research.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citation for the LibriSpeech dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. "LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books." In Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). IEEE, 2015, pp. 5206â€“5210.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section to confirm the dataset used.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I am ready to create the dataset entry for LibriSpeech.
