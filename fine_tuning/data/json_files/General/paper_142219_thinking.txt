To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting" by Songtao Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted numerical experiments on public datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention five public traffic datasets: **PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08, PEMS07(M), and PEMS07(L)**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their types, time intervals, number of nodes, and time steps.

In the **table summarizing the datasets**, I will find the following information:

1. **PEMS04**: A traffic flow dataset with a time interval of 5 minutes, consisting of 307 nodes and 16,992 time steps.
2. **PEMS07**: Another traffic flow dataset with a time interval of 5 minutes, consisting of 883 nodes and 28,224 time steps.
3. **PEMS08**: A traffic flow dataset with a time interval of 5 minutes, consisting of 170 nodes and 17,856 time steps.
4. **PEMS07(M)**: A traffic speed dataset with a time interval of 5 minutes, consisting of 228 nodes and 12,672 time steps.
5. **PEMS07(L)**: Another traffic speed dataset with a time interval of 5 minutes, consisting of 1,026 nodes and 12,672 time steps.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as the source for these datasets. The citation for the PeMS datasets is as follows:

- **Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)**: 
  > Chao Chen, Karl Petty, Alexander Skabardonis, Pravin Varaiya, and Zhanfeng Jia. *Freeway performance measurement system: Mining loop detector data*. Transportation Research Record, 1748(1):96â€“102, 2001.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
