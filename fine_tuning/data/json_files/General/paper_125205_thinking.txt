To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Multi-Domain Performance with Active Learning-based Improvement Strategies" by Anand Gokul Mahalingam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used. The introduction often outlines the problem and may reference datasets that are central to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **"Domains and Datasets" section**, which is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors list several domains along with the corresponding datasets:

1. **Visual Question Answering: VQA 2.0 Dataset** - This dataset is used with the 'Neural VQA' model.
2. **Question Answering: SQuAD 2.0** - This dataset is utilized with the 'BiDirectional Attention' model.
3. **Audio Classification: Urban Sounds Dataset** - This dataset is analyzed using a 'Dilated CNN' model.
4. **Image Classification: CIFAR10** - This dataset is processed using the 'VGG16' model.
5. **Image Classification: CIFAR100** - This dataset is also processed using the 'VGG16' model.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sizes, characteristics, and any specific configurations mentioned in the methodology or results sections.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **VQA 2.0 Dataset**:
  > Ren, M., Kiros, R., & Zemel, R. (2015). *Exploring Models and Data for Image Question Answering*. Retrieved from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.02074.pdf

- For **SQuAD 2.0**:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2018). *SQuAD 2.0: The Next Generation of the Stanford Question Answering Dataset*. Retrieved from https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/

- For **Urban Sounds Dataset**:
  > Salamon, J., Jacoby, C., & Bello, J. P. (2014). *A Dataset for Urban Sound Research*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, Orlando, USA.

- For **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Retrieved from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
