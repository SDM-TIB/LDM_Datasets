To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When MAML Can Adapt Fast and How to Assist When It Cannot" by Sébastien M. R. Arnold et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the success of MAML on various datasets, which suggests that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using several benchmark datasets for meta-learning tasks, specifically:

1. **Omniglot**: A dataset used for few-shot learning, consisting of handwritten characters from various alphabets.
2. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning benchmark derived from the CIFAR-100 dataset, which contains images of 100 different classes.
3. **mini-ImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, commonly used for few-shot learning tasks.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets are indeed used for the experiments and to gather any additional details about their configurations or characteristics.

After confirming the datasets, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

- For **Omniglot**:
  > Lake, B. M., Salakhutdinov, R., & Tenenbaum, J. B. (2015). Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction. *Science*, 350(6266), 1332–1338.

- For **CIFAR-FS**:
  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P., & Vedaldi, A. (2019). Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers. In *International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For **mini-ImageNet**:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
