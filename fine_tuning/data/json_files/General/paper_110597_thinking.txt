To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving tracking with a tracklet associator" by Rémi Nahon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a method evaluated on the **MOT17 dataset**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional datasets mentioned. The introduction discusses the challenges of multiple object tracking (MOT) and references the **MOT17 challenge**, which is a well-known dataset in this field.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors state that they evaluated their model on the **training set of the MOT17 challenge**, confirming that this is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the MOT17 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MOT17 Dataset**:
  > A. Milan, L. Leal-Taixé, I. D. Reid, S. Roth, and K. Schindler. *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. 2016. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00831

Since the authors specifically mention using the training set of the MOT17 challenge, I will ensure to note that in my dataset description.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MOT17 dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
