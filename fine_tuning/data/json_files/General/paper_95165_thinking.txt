To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contextualized Attention-based Knowledge Transfer for Spoken Conversational Question Answering" by Chenyu You et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **Spoken-CoQA dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges in spoken conversational question answering (SCQA) and mention the lack of benchmark datasets. They reference several benchmark datasets, including **Spoken-SQuAD**, which is relevant to the context of their work.

In the **dataset section (Section 2)**, the authors explicitly describe the **Spoken-CoQA dataset**. They provide details about the dataset structure, indicating that each example consists of a passage, multiple queries, and corresponding answers. This section confirms that the Spoken-CoQA dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Spoken-CoQA dataset. The authors cite their previous work where the dataset was introduced:

- For **Spoken-CoQA**, the citation is:
  > Chenyu You, Nuo Chen, Fuli Liu, D. Yang, and Y. Zou. *Towards Data Distillation for End-to-End Spoken Conversational Question Answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.08923, 2020.

Additionally, they mention **Spoken-SQuAD** in the introduction, so I will look for its citation as well:

- For **Spoken-SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > C.-H. Li, S.-L. Wu, C.-L. Liu, and H.-y. Lee. *Spoken SQuAD: A Study of Mitigating the Impact of Speech Recognition Errors on Listening Comprehension*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.00320, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
