To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoftCVI: Contrastive variational inference with self-generated soft labels" by Daniel Ward et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for empirical validation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference specific datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant information about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (section 4). The authors describe various Bayesian inference tasks and may reference datasets used for these tasks. I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, along with their descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "PosteriorDB" or "SBI-Benchmark," I will look for their respective citations in the references. If the datasets are derived from other studies, I will trace back to the original papers to provide accurate citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly attributed.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining the integrity of the citations and providing a clear reference for future research.
