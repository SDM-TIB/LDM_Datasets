To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Deeper Deep Reinforcement Learning with Spectral Normalization" by Johan Bjorck et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections of the paper. These sections often provide a summary of the datasets used in the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

2. **Identify Sections on Experiments and Datasets**: Next, I will navigate to the sections that discuss experiments and datasets. In this paper, I will specifically look for sections labeled "Experiments" or "Datasets" to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used.

3. **Extract Dataset Information**: In the relevant sections, I will extract the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any specific details provided by the authors. For instance, I will note the number of samples, types of tasks, and any unique characteristics of the datasets.

4. **Check the References Section**: After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the references section of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

5. **Compile the Information**: I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
   - The name of the dataset
   - A brief description of the dataset
   - The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section.

6. **Review for Completeness**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure that I have captured all datasets mentioned in the paper and that the citations are accurate and complete.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I extract the datasets from the paper thoroughly and accurately, providing all necessary details for future reference.
