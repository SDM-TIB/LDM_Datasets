To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auxiliary Features-Guided Super Resolution for Monte Carlo Rendering" by Qiqi Hou and Feng Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of high-resolution auxiliary features for super-resolution in Monte Carlo rendering, which suggests that datasets related to these features may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using the **BCR dataset** and the **Gharbi dataset** for their experiments.

1. **BCR Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 2,449 images from 1,463 scenes rendered by Blender Cycles. They specify that they used 2,126 images for training, 193 for validation, and 130 for testing.

2. **Gharbi Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a comparison point for their method, but specific details about its composition are not provided in the text.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BCR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hou, Qiqi, Li, Zhan, Marshall, Carl S, et al. "Fast Monte Carlo Rendering via Multi-Resolution Sampling." Graphics Interface Conference, 2021, 25:1–9.

- For the **Gharbi dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gharbi, Michaël, Li, Tzu-Mao, Aittala, Miika, et al. "Sample-based Monte Carlo denoising using a kernel-splatting network." ACM Transactions on Graphics 38.4 (2019), 1–12.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
