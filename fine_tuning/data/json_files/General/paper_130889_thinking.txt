To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Cross-Quality Face Verification using Blind Face Restoration" by Messaoud Bengherabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **cross-quality LFW database**, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they state that they utilized two datasets:

1. **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**: This dataset is widely recognized for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments. It is referenced in the paper as a baseline for their experiments.

2. **XQLFW (Cross-Quality Faces in the Wild)**: This is a variant of the LFW dataset that includes synthetic degradations to address challenges in facial recognition under low-quality conditions. The authors describe it as containing images with varying levels of degradation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LFW**, the citation is:
  > G. B. Huang, M. Mattar, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In Workshop on faces in 'Real-Life' Images: detection, alignment, and recognition, 2008.

- For **XQLFW**, the citation is:
  > M. Knoche, S. Hormann, and G. Rigoll. *Cross-quality lfw: A database for analyzing cross-resolution image face recognition in unconstrained environments*. In 2021 16th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2021), pp. 1â€“5, IEEE, 2021.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
