To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LongRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-context LLMs" by Ziyan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the research. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their methods on four datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly subsection 3.1, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their sources, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that are mentioned.

The paper identifies four datasets used in the experiments:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is designed for end-to-end question answering, containing 3,610 questions sourced from real Google search queries, with answers identified in Wikipedia articles.

2. **HotpotQA**: This dataset consists of two-hop questions over diverse topics, focusing on the full-wiki setting where two Wikipedia passages are required to answer the questions. It contains 7,405 questions.

3. **Qasper**: This dataset is an information-seeking question answering dataset over academic research papers, where each question is a follow-up to the title and abstract of a paper.

4. **MultiFieldQA-en**: This dataset is based on long documents from various sources, including legal documents and academic papers, and is also structured for question answering.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
