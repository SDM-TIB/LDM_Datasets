To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DISO: A Domain Ontology for Modeling Dislocations in Crystalline Materials" by Ahmad Zainul Ihsan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the ontology and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Potential Use Cases)**, where the authors describe two potential use cases for the DISO ontology. Here, they mention the use of dislocation dynamics simulation data and dislocation experiment data. I will look for any specific datasets referenced in these use cases.

In the use case descriptions, the authors mention that they generated a dislocation dynamics dataset from the MoDELib software. This dataset is crucial, and I will need to find its details. They also refer to a dataset of dislocation structure data produced by MoDELib, which is linked to the GitHub repository.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references the following:

1. **Dislocation Dynamics Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the MoDELib software and can be found in the GitHub repository. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ahmad Zainul Ihsan, Said Fathalla, and Stefan Sandfeld. 2023. DISO: A Domain Ontology for Modeling Dislocations in Crystalline Materials. In The 38th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC â€™23), March 27-March 31, 2023, Tallinn, Estonia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, Article 4, 8 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3555776.3578739

2. **Materials Project Dataset**: The authors mention that details of the crystal structure of Nickel are taken from the Materials Project repository. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Anubhav Jain, Shyue Ping Ong, Geoffroy Hautier, Wei Chen, William Davidson Richards, Stephen Dacek, Shreyas Cholia, Dan Gunter, David Skinner, Gerbrand Ceder, and Kristin a. Persson. 2013. The Materials Project: A materials genome approach to accelerating materials innovation. APL Materials 1, 1 (2013), 011002. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4812323

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
