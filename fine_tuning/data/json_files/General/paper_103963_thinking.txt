To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secure PAC Bayesian Regression via Real Shamir Secret Sharing" by Jaron Skovsted Gundersen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of data privacy in machine learning and mention the use of distributed datasets. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely. Here, the authors explicitly mention using the **Boston house price dataset**, which is a well-known dataset suitable for linear regression. They describe it as containing 506 instances with 13 features targeting the median value of the prices of homes in $1000â€™s. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Boston house price dataset. The dataset is a copy of the UCI ML housing dataset, which is commonly referenced in machine learning literature. The citation for the original dataset is:

- For the **Boston housing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, Dheeru, and Graff, Casey. "UCI Machine Learning Repository." 2017. URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing.

Since the authors used a copy of this dataset from the sklearn library, I will note that the citation for the original dataset suffices.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Boston housing dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for any further processing or review.
