To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks for Optimal Bidding Strategies of Generation Units in Electricity Markets" by Pegah Rokhforoz and Olga Fink, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed algorithm is evaluated on the **IEEE 30-bus system** and the **IEEE 39-bus system**, which suggests that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors mention that they evaluate their algorithm on the **IEEE 30-bus system** under different scenarios and also test the model on the **IEEE 39-bus system**. This confirms that both datasets are used for evaluation.

In the **case study evaluations section**, the authors provide parameters for both the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 39-bus systems, including generation units and their capacities. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' structure and context.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 39-bus systems are standard benchmarks in power systems research, and their citations are typically found in the literature.

For the **IEEE 30-bus system**, the citation is:
> "IEEE Power System Test Case Archive." *IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting*, 2009. Available: http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/

For the **IEEE 39-bus system**, the citation is:
> "IEEE Power System Test Case Archive." *IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting*, 2009. Available: http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/pstca/

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
