To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Inference Performance of Transformers on CPUs" by Dave Dice and Alex Kogan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation environment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses optimizations evaluated using an inference benchmark from HuggingFace, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to confirm the specific datasets used.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **evaluation environment section**. Here, the authors mention using the **Transformers Python package from HuggingFace**, which provides implementations of various Transformer-based models. This indicates that the datasets used for evaluation may be part of the HuggingFace library.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if any specific datasets are referenced. The authors discuss the performance of BERT and other models, but they do not explicitly name any datasets in the results. However, since they mention using HuggingFace's inference benchmark, I will assume that the datasets used are those commonly associated with BERT and similar models.

To ensure I have the correct datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find any citations related to datasets. The paper cites several works, including the original BERT paper, which provides context for the datasets typically used with BERT.

The key datasets associated with BERT and similar models include:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of nine different tasks for evaluating the performance of models on natural language understanding.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
