To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Return to Tradition: Learning Reliable Heuristics with Classical Machine Learning" by Dillon Z. Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets or references to benchmark datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using the **2023 International Planning Competition Learning Track benchmarks**. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find the specific datasets used.

I will also check the **background and notation section** for any definitions or explanations that might reference datasets. If the authors describe any datasets or provide details about their structure or content, I will take note of that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. 

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset like the **Blocksworld domain**, I will look for the original source or paper that introduced this dataset. If they mention using datasets from the **International Planning Competition**, I will find the relevant citation that describes these datasets.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will organize the extracted information in a clear and structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
