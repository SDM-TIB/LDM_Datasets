To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalized Zero- and Few-Shot Learning via Aligned Variational Autoencoders" by Edgar Schönfeld et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed model on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generalized zero-shot learning and mention that they evaluate their model on benchmark datasets. This suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention four datasets: **CUB-200-2011**, **SUN attribute**, **Animals with Attributes 1 (AWA1)**, and **Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2)**. Each dataset is used in the context of zero-shot and few-shot learning settings.

To gather more details about each dataset, I will look for any specific descriptions or characteristics provided in the text. The authors typically include information such as the number of classes, the number of images, and any unique attributes associated with the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

1. **CUB-200-2011**: The citation is:
   > P. Welinder, S. Branson, T. Mita, C. Wah, F. Schroff, S. Belongie, and P. Perona. *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. In 2010.

2. **SUN attribute**: The citation is:
   > G. Patterson and J. Hays. *Sun Attribute Database: Discovering, Annotating, and Recognizing Scene Attributes*. In CVPR, pages 2751–2758, 2012.

3. **Animals with Attributes 1 (AWA1)**: The citation is:
   > C. H. Lampert, H. Nickisch, and S. Harmeling. *Learning to Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer*. In CVPR, pages 951–958, 2009.

4. **Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA2)**: The citation is:
   > Y. Xian, Z. Akata, G. Sharma, Q. Nguyen, M. Hein, and B. Schiele. *Latent Embeddings for Zero-Shot Classification*. In CVPR, pages 69–77, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their full citations for reference.
