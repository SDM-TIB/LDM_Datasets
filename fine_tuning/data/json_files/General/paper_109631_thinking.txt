To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer Compressed Sensing via Global Image Tokens" by Marlon Bran Lorenzana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a novel image decomposition method for compressed sensing in MRI, which suggests that there may be datasets related to MRI imaging.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe any specific datasets used for their experiments. In this case, the authors mention using a subset of the **NYU fastMRI DICOM brain database** for training and testing their models. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will then look for more details about this dataset in the **results and discussion section**. Here, the authors specify that the dataset consists of **64, 180 T1-w cross-sectional MR images** and provide information about how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. This gives me a clearer understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **NYU fastMRI dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Jure Zbontar, Florian Knoll, Anuroop Sriram, Tullie Murrell, Zhengnan Huang, Matthew J. Muckley, Aaron Defazio, Ruben Stern, Patricia Johnson, Mary Bruno, Marc Parente, Krzysztof J. Geras, Joe Katsnelson, Hersh Chandarana, Zizhao Zhang, Michal Drozdzal, Adriana Romero, Michael Rabbat, Pascal Vincent, Nafissa Yakubova, James Pinkerton, Duo Wang, Erich Owens, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Michael P. Recht, Daniel K. Sodickson, and Yvonne W. Lui, “fastMRI: An Open Dataset and Benchmarks for Accelerated MRI,” 2019.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **NYU fastMRI DICOM brain database**, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
