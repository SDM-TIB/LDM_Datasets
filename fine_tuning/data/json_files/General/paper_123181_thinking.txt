To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unnoticeable Backdoor Attacks on Graph Neural Networks" by Enyan Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on "real-world datasets," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention four public real-world datasets: **Cora**, **Pubmed**, **Flickr**, and **OGB-arxiv**. Each dataset is described in terms of its characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes.

I will then check the **dataset statistics table** (Table 3) for detailed information about each dataset. The table provides the following information:

1. **Cora**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 2,708
   - Number of Edges: 5,429
   - Number of Features: 1,433
   - Number of Classes: 7

2. **Pubmed**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 19,717
   - Number of Edges: 44,338
   - Number of Features: 500
   - Number of Classes: 3

3. **Flickr**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 89,250
   - Number of Edges: 899,756
   - Number of Features: 500
   - Number of Classes: 7

4. **OGB-arxiv**: 
   - Number of Nodes: 169,343
   - Number of Edges: 1,166,243
   - Number of Features: 128
   - Number of Classes: 40

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the research community, they may not have specific citations in the paper. Instead, I will provide general references for these datasets based on their common usage:

- **Cora Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Pubmed Dataset**: 
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

- **Flickr Dataset**: 
  > This dataset is often referenced in various studies but does not have a specific citation. It is commonly used in graph-based learning tasks.

- **OGB-arxiv Dataset**: 
  > Hu, W., Fey, M., Zitnik, M., Dong, Y., Ren, H., Liu, B., Catasta, M., & Leskovec, J. (2020). Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs. In NeurIPS, 33, 22118-22133.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
