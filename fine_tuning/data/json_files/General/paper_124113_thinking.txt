To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Difficulty in chirality recognition for Transformer architectures learning chemical structures from string representations" by Yasuhiro Yoshikai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of chemical language models and mention that they utilize public databases for training. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Dataset." Here, the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. They mention the **ZINC-15 dataset**, which contains approximately 1 billion molecules, and the **MoleculeNet** dataset, which is used for evaluating molecular property prediction tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors summarize their findings related to the performance of descriptors on various molecular property prediction tasks, referencing specific datasets such as **ESOL**, **FreeSolv**, **Lipophilicity**, **BACE**, **BBBP**, and **ClinTox**. Each dataset is associated with a specific task type and performance metrics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are as follows:

1. **ZINC-15 dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the study along with their full citations for future use.
