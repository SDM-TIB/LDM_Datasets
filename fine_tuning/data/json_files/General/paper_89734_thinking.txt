To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Co-VeGAN: Complex-Valued Generative Adversarial Network for Compressive Sensing MR Image Reconstruction" by Bhavya Vasudeva et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **Methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their experiments. In this section, they mention that they tested their proposed method on three different datasets. This is a crucial point as it indicates that specific datasets will be detailed.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide a summary of their findings based on the datasets used. They mention the datasets explicitly, which will help in confirming their names and any relevant details.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **MICCAI 2013 Grand Challenge Dataset**: This dataset includes T1 weighted MR images of the brain. The authors specify that they used 20,787 images for training and 2,000 images for testing.

2. **MRNet Dataset**: This dataset consists of coronal MR images of the knee. The authors indicate that they randomly selected 12,500 images for training and 2,000 non-overlapping images for testing.

3. **fastMRI Dataset**: This dataset contains coronal proton density weighted single-coil MR images of the knee. The authors note that this dataset includes complex-valued images and that they cropped the images to a size of 320 Ã— 320.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

- For the **MICCAI 2013 Grand Challenge Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Landman, B. A., & W. (Eds.). (2013). *2013 Diencephalon standard challenge*.

- For the **MRNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bien, N., et al. (2018). *Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee magnetic resonance imaging: Development and retrospective validation of MRNet*. PLoS Medicine, 15.

- For the **fastMRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zbontar, J., et al. (2018). *fastMRI: An open dataset and benchmarks for accelerated MRI*. ArXiv.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference.
