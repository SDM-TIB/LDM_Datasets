To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-Time Correlation Tracking via Joint Model Compression and Transfer" by Ning Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the lightweight student network accelerates the speed of state-of-the-art deep CF trackers." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section V)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. The authors mention evaluating their tracker on the **OTB-2013**, **OTB-2015**, and **Temple-Color** datasets, which are popular benchmarks for visual tracking.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **OTB-2013 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2013). *Online object tracking: A benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

2. **OTB-2015 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M.-H. (2015). *Object tracking benchmark*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI), 37(9), 1834-1848.

3. **Temple-Color Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Liang, P., Blasch, E., & Ling, H. (2015). *Encoding color information for visual tracking: algorithms and benchmark*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 24(12), 5630-5644.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.

This methodical approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information and providing proper credit to the original sources.
