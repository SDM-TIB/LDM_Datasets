To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Customize StyleGAN with One Hand Sketch" by Zhang Shaocong, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted quantitative evaluations on synthesized datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using the **GANSketch dataset**, which provides four test cases for quantitative evaluation, including sketches and real images from the LSUN datasets. This is a clear indication of the datasets being utilized.

The paper also references two additional datasets:
1. **QuickDraw**: This dataset is mentioned as a source of real hand-drawn sketches used for testing the method in real-world scenarios.
2. **Sketchy dataset**: This dataset is used to test the method with a broader range of sketch styles and object poses.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GANSketch dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sheng-Yu Wang, David Bau, and Jun-Yan Zhu. *Sketch Your Own GAN*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 14050–14060, 2021.

- For the **LSUN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Fisher Yu, Ari Seff, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Thomas Funkhouser, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a Large-Scale Image Dataset Using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365, 2015.

- For the **QuickDraw dataset**, the citation is:
  > Salman Cheema, Sumit Gulwani, and Joseph LaViola. *QuickDraw: Improving Drawing Experience for Geometric Diagrams*. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pages 1037–1064, 2012.

- For the **Sketchy dataset**, the citation is:
  > Patsorn Sangkloy, Nathan Burnell, Cusuh Ham, and James Hays. *The Sketchy Database: Learning to Retrieve Badly Drawn Bunnies*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(4):1–12, 2016.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
