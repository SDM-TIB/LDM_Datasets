To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Model Meets Graph Neural Network in Knowledge Distillation" by Shengxiang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of nodes, edges, classes, and features.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cora**: This dataset is described as a smaller academic citation network with approximately 2,700 papers categorized into 7 groups covering various branches of machine learning.

2. **PubMed**: This dataset consists of 19,717 scientific publications related to diabetes, segmented into three groups, with a total of 44,338 citation links.

3. **Arxiv**: This dataset represents a large academic citation network focusing on papers in natural language processing and computer vision, including over 170,000 papers classified into 40 distinct categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Cora**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings*. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Vol. 48, PMLR, 40–48, 2016.

- For **PubMed**, the citation is:
  > Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Marinka Zitnik, Yuxiao Dong, Hongyu Ren, Bowen Liu, Michele Catasta, and Jure Leskovec. *Open Graph Benchmark: Datasets for Machine Learning on Graphs*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), Vol. 33, 22118–22133, 2020.

- For **Arxiv**, the citation is:
  > Zhilin Yang, William Cohen, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings*. In International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Vol. 48, PMLR, 40–48, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research.
