To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YOLO ALGORITHM WITH HYBRID ATTENTION FEATURE PYRAMID NETWORK FOR SOLDER JOINT DEFECT DETECTION" by Li Ang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a new approach for solder joint defect detection, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved, particularly since it mentions improving detection accuracy.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they describe the solder joint defect dataset, which contains 3,154 defective solder joint images obtained using a CCD industrial camera. The dataset includes two types of defects: ineffective defects (1,680 images) and foot shifting defects (1,474 images). The authors also mention how the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is described as being prepared and modified based on a previous work, I will need to identify that original source. The authors reference the preparation method as adapted from [YG22]. 

I will check the reference for [YG22] to retrieve its full citation:
> Nuo Yang and Wei Guo. *Application of improved yolov5 model for strip surface defect detection*. In 2022 Global Reliability and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM-Yantai), pages 1â€“5. IEEE, 2022. doi:10.1109/PHM-Yantai55411.2022.9942194.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Solder Joint Defect Dataset**: Contains 3,154 images of defective solder joints, with 1,680 ineffective defects and 1,474 foot shifting defects. The dataset is divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%).

The full citation for the dataset preparation method is based on the work by Yang and Guo (2022).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
