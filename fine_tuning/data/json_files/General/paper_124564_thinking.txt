To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Reliable Uncertainty Quantification via Deep Ensemble in Multi-output Regression Task" by Sunwoong Yang and Kwanjung Yee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data preparation and training details)**, where the authors describe the specific dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they are predicting six aerodynamic coefficients for a missile configuration based on data obtained from the Missile Datcom solver. They state that 9800 points were generated through full-factorial sampling of five flow conditions.

In this section, the authors detail the dataset's composition, including the input parameters (Mach number, roll angle, pitch control fin deflection angle, roll control fin deflection angle, and angle of attack) and the six aerodynamic coefficients being predicted (normal force coefficient, axial force coefficient, pitching moment coefficient, rolling moment coefficient, yawing moment coefficient, and side force coefficient).

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the source of the dataset. The authors reference the Missile Datcom manual, which is crucial for proper citation.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
- Blake, W.B. (1998). *Missile Datcom: Userâ€™s Manual-1997 FORTRAN 90 Revision*. Technical Report. Air Force Research Lab Wright-Patterson AFB OH Air Vehicles Directorate.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, into a structured format for clarity and completeness. This ensures that all necessary information is captured for future reference or analysis.
