To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixture of Experts in a Mixture of RL settings" by Timon Willi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not detail specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are often described in the context of experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Mixture of Experts (MoEs) in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will continue to the methodology section, where the authors typically outline their experimental setup.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors mention using the **Gymnax suite** for implementing environments, which is a library for reinforcement learning environments. They specifically refer to three environments: **SpaceInvaders**, **Breakout**, and **Asterix**. These environments are crucial for the experiments and can be considered datasets in the context of reinforcement learning.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these environments. The Gymnax suite is mentioned, and I will look for its citation:

- For **Gymnax**, the citation is:
  > Lange, R. (2022). Gymnax: A JAX-based reinforcement learning environment library. Retrieved from http://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax.

Additionally, the authors reference **MinAtar environments**, which are also part of their experimental setup. I will look for the citation for MinAtar:

- For **MinAtar**, the citation is:
  > Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). MinAtar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

1. **Gymnax Suite** (used for implementing environments):
   - Citation: Lange, R. (2022). Gymnax: A JAX-based reinforcement learning environment library. Retrieved from http://github.com/RobertTLange/gymnax.

2. **MinAtar environments** (used for experiments):
   - Citation: Young, K., & Tian, T. (2019). MinAtar: An Atari-inspired testbed for thorough and reproducible reinforcement learning experiments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.03176.

With this information, I am ready to create entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This structured approach allows for a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the research paper.
