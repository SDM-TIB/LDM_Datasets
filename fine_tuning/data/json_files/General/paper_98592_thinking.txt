To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Severity Quantification and Lesion Localization of COVID-19 on CXR using Vision Transformer" by Gwanghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the importance of automated frameworks for quantifying COVID-19 severity and mentions the use of chest X-ray (CXR) images, which suggests that datasets related to CXR images are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental details section** where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **JSRT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 247 normal CXR images used for segmentation network training, along with its segmentation labels from the SCR dataset.

2. **CheXpert Dataset**: A large dataset containing 190,847 frontal CXR images with annotations for 14 types of radiological findings, used for pretraining the feature embedding network.

3. **Brixia Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as being used for training the model, and it contains a consensus subset where five different radiologists annotate CXR images.

4. **CNUH Dataset**: This dataset is used for external testing and consists of CXR images from another independent domestic institution.

5. **BIMCV Dataset**: This dataset contains COVID-19 lesion segmentation labels annotated on 12 frontal images, used for qualitative analysis.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For the **JSRT Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **BIMCV Dataset**, the citation is:

- The **CNUH Dataset** is not explicitly cited in the references, but it is mentioned as being collected from Chungnam National University Hospital.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its source.
