To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Study of Forward-Forward Algorithm for Self-Supervised Learning" by Jonas Brenig and Radu Timofte, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their benchmark employs **four standard datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

2. **Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST)**: A dataset that serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items.

3. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**: A dataset containing images of house numbers from Google Street View, which includes cropped digits and is used for digit recognition tasks.

4. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets are used for evaluating the performance of their proposed methods, which further validates their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yaniv Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
