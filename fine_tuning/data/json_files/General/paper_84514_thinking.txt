To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Legal Judgment Prediction in English" by Ilias Chalkidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the release of a new English legal judgment prediction dataset containing cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). This indicates that a dataset is indeed present in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (ECHR Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe it as containing approximately 11.5k cases from the ECHR's public database, including facts extracted from case descriptions and mappings to articles of the Convention that were violated. This section also outlines the dataset's structure, including training, development, and test splits.

I will note the key details about the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: ECHR Dataset
- **Description**: Contains approximately 11.5k cases from the European Court of Human Rights, with facts extracted and mapped to violated articles.
- **Split**: The dataset is divided into training, development, and test sets, with specific statistics provided.

To ensure I have the correct citation for this dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The authors reference their dataset submission, which is available at https://archive.org/details/ECHR-ACL2019. This URL will serve as the citation for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

The final output will include:
1. The dataset name: ECHR Dataset
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The citation: "ECHR Dataset. Available at: https://archive.org/details/ECHR-ACL2019."

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset from the research paper.
