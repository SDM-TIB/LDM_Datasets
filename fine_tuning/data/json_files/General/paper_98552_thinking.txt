To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast hyperspectral image denoising and inpainting based on low-rank and sparse representations" by Lina Zhuang and José M. Bioucas-Dias, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with "simulated and real data," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific datasets used in the study. In the paper, the authors describe two semi-synthetic observed hyperspectral datasets that were simulated using additive Gaussian noise or Poissonian noise. They mention that the clean images were obtained from:

1. **Pavia Centre subscene 1**: This dataset has a size of [200 × 200] pixels × 103 bands.
2. **Washington DC Mall subscene 2**: This dataset has a size of [256 × 256] pixels × 191 bands.

The authors also provide details about how these datasets were processed, including the removal of low signal-to-noise bands and the projection onto a signal subspace learned via SVD.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Pavia Centre dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pavia scenes were provided by Prof. Paolo Gamba from the Telecommunications and Remote Sensing Laboratory, Pavia University (Italy) and can be downloaded from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes.

- For the **Washington DC Mall dataset**, the citation is:
  > This dataset is available from the Purdue University Research Repository (https://engineering.purdue.edu/∼biehl/MultiSpec/hyperspectral.html).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
