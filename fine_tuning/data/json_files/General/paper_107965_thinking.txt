To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Masking for Self-Supervised Learning" by Yuge Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on various datasets, including **ImageNet100**, **STL10**, **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, **Flowers102**, and **iNaturalist**. This suggests that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology, the authors discuss their approach and mention the datasets used for evaluation, confirming the earlier findings from the abstract.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results for their method on the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet100**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset containing 100 classes, used for classification tasks.
2. **STL10**: A dataset derived from ImageNet, consisting of 10 object classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.
3. **CIFAR10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
4. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
5. **Flowers102**: A dataset containing 102 flower categories, with a total of 8,189 images.
6. **iNaturalist**: A dataset for species classification, containing images of various species.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and understanding the datasets' origins.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **STL10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A. Y., and Al, J. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2011.

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. E. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Flowers102**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., and Zisserman, A. *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In 2008 Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing, 2008.

- For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
  > Horn, G. V., Aodha, O. M., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Adam, H., Perona, P., and Belongie, S. J. *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In 2018 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation for clarity and proper referencing.
