To extract datasets from the research paper titled "V2XP-ASG: Generating Adversarial Scenes for Vehicle-to-Everything Perception" by Hao Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose an open adversarial scene generator, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **OPV2V Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) perception dataset that has been augmented with infrastructure sensor data. The authors specify that the training split of OPV2V is used to train modern V2X perception models, and they provide details about the number of driving logs and frames.

2. **Heuristic Dataset**: This dataset is created by the authors and includes high traffic density scenes with severe occlusions. It consists of frames sampled from driving logs in the CARLA simulator, specifically curated to include scenes with a low average number of LiDAR points.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **OPV2V Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Xu, H. Xiang, X. Xia, X. Han, J. Li, and J. Ma. *OPV2V: An Open Benchmark Dataset and Fusion Pipeline for Perception with Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication*. In Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 2583â€“2589, 2022.

- For the **Heuristic Dataset**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Hao Xiang, Runsheng Xu, Xin Xia, Zhaoliang Zheng, Bolei Zhou, Jiaqi Ma. *Heuristic Dataset for V2X Perception*. Unpublished dataset, 2023.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
