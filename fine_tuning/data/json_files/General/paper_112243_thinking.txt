To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RT-DNAS: Real-time Constrained Differentiable Neural Architecture Search for 3D Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation" by Qing Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **extended 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for any additional details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as covering right ventricle (RV), myocardium (MYO), and left ventricle (LV) labeled by experienced radiologists, and they specify that there are a total of 150 exams, with 100 used for training. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and purpose.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the extended 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wang, T., Xiong, J., Xu, X., Jiang, M., Yuan, H., Huang, M., Zhuang, J., Shi, Y. "MSU-Net: Multiscale Statistical U-Net for Real-Time 3D Cardiac MRI Video Segmentation." In International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention, pp. 614â€“622. Springer, 2019.

Since the paper primarily discusses the extended 2017 MICCAI ACDC dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any downstream processing or review.
