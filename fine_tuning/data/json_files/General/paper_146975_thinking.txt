To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Vision-Language Models as Emotion Recognizers in Context Awareness" by Yuxuan Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors fine-tuned LVLMs on two CAER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe two datasets:

1. **EMOTIC Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as the most widely used context emotion dataset, containing 23,571 images with 34,320 annotated agents. Each agent is assigned one or more of the 26 discrete emotion labels based on their apparent emotional states. The dataset is split into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) sets.

2. **HECO Dataset**: This dataset consists of 9,385 images of 19,781 annotated agents, with each agent labeled with one of eight emotions: Surprise, Excitement, Happiness, Peace, Disgust, Anger, Fear, and Sadness. Similar to EMOTIC, it is also split into training (70%), validation (10%), and testing (20%) sets.

To confirm the details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **EMOTIC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ronak Kosti, Jose M Alvarez, Adria Recasens, and Agata Lapedriza. *Emotion recognition in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1667–1675, 2017.

- For the **HECO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dingkang Yang, Shuai Huang, Shunli Wang, Yang Liu, Peng Zhai, Liuzhen Su, Mingcheng Li, and Lihua Zhang. *Emotion recognition for multiple context awareness*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 144–162. Springer, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.
