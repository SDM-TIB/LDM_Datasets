To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tracking-by-Trackers with a Distilled and Reinforced Model" by Matteo Dunnhofer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they were used.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors often discuss the performance of their methods on various benchmarks. This section may include additional details about the datasets, such as their characteristics, the number of samples, and any specific splits used for training and testing.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **GOT-10k Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a large-scale benchmark for generic object tracking, consisting of 180 videos with diverse object classes and motion patterns.
   - Citation: Huang, L., Zhao, X., Huang, K. (2019). GOT-10k: A Large High-Diversity Benchmark for Generic Object Tracking in the Wild. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*.

2. **UAV123 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its unique characteristics, as it includes sequences captured from low-altitude UAVs, making it distinct from traditional benchmarks.
   - Citation: Mueller, M., Smith, N., Ghanem, B. (2016). A Benchmark and Simulator for UAV Tracking. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*.

3. **LaSOT Dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as a high-quality benchmark for large-scale single object tracking, consisting of 280 videos.
   - Citation: Fan, H., Lin, L., Yang, F., et al. (2019). LaSOT: A High-quality Benchmark for Large-scale Single Object Tracking. In *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

4. **OTB-100 Dataset**: This dataset is widely used in the tracking literature and consists of 100 challenging videos.
   - Citation: Wu, Y., Lim, J., Yang, M.H. (2013). Online object tracking: A benchmark. In *IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*.

5. **VOT2019 Dataset**: This dataset is used in the annual VOT tracking competitions and includes 60 challenging videos.
   - Citation: Kristan, M., Matas, J., Leonardis, A., et al. (2019). The Seventh Visual Object Tracking VOT2019 Challenge Results. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
