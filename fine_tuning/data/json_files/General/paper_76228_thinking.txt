To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Pursuit and Dictionary Learning for Blind Source Separation in Polyphonic Music Recordings" by Sören Schulze and Emily J. King, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed algorithm on various audio samples, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experimental evaluation section**, the authors discuss the datasets used for testing their algorithm. They mention using audio samples from various sources, including:

1. **BASS-dB set**: This dataset is referenced as containing instruments that violate the structural assumptions made by the authors, but it is still mentioned in the context of their experiments.

2. **Data from Jaiswal et al.**: The authors used publicly available data from Jaiswal et al. for their experiments, which consists of computer-synthesized samples with two instruments.

3. **Data from Duan et al.**: The authors also utilized data from Duan et al., which includes acoustic and synthesized instruments.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **BASS-dB set**, the citation is:
  > Vincent, E., Gribonval, R., & Févotte, C. (2006). Performance measurement in blind audio source separation. *IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, 14(4), 1462-1469. doi:10.1109/TSA.2005.858005.

- For the **data used by Jaiswal et al.**, the citation is:
  > Jaiswal, R., Fitzgerald, D., Coyle, E., & Rickard, S. (2011). Clustering NMF basis functions using shifted NMF for monaural sound source separation. In *ICASSP 2011 - 2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing*, 245-248. doi:10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5946386.

- For the **data used by Duan et al.**, the citation is:
  > Duan, Z., Zhang, Y., Zhang, C., & Shi, Z. (2008). Unsupervised single-channel music source separation by average harmonic structure modeling. *IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing*, 16(4), 766-778. doi:10.1109/TASL.2008.919073.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
