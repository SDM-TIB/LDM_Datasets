To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning Models for Dengue Forecasting in Singapore" by Zi Iun Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of various machine learning techniques for forecasting dengue cases, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **Dataset and Features section**, the authors explicitly state that they utilize **weekly dengue incidence data in Singapore** from January 1, 2012, to November 29, 2019, provided by the National Environment Agency. This dataset consists of 412 data points, which is a clear indication of a primary dataset used in their study.

Next, I will look for any additional datasets or features that are mentioned. The authors describe the use of **meteorological data** and **search engine trends** as features for their machine learning models. They specify that historical rainfall, temperature, and wind speed data are available from the Meteorological Service Singapore, and that search trends can be obtained from Google Trends. However, these are not datasets in the same sense as the dengue incidence data but rather features derived from other sources.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset is the weekly dengue incidence data, and the citation for this data source is:

- For the **weekly dengue incidence data**:
  > National Environment Agency. "NEA | Dengue Cases." Accessed: Feb. 19, 2024. [Online]. Available: https://www.nea.gov.sg/dengue-zika/dengue/dengue-cases

Additionally, I will note the sources for the meteorological data and search trends, even though they are not datasets per se:

- For **meteorological data**:
  > Meteorological Service Singapore. "Historical Daily Records." Accessed: Mar. 14, 2024. [Online]. Available: http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily/

- For **Google Trends data**:
  > Google Trends. "Google Trends." Accessed: Mar. 14, 2024. [Online]. Available: https://trends.google.ws/trends/explore?date=all&geo=SG&q=dengue&hl=en-GB

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
