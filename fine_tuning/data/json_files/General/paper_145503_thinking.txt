To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intermediate Distillation: Data-Efficient Distillation from Black-Box LLMs for Information Retrieval" by Zizhong Li, Haopeng Zhang, and Jiawei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two benchmark datasets used for their experiments:

1. **NaturalQuestions (NQ)**: This dataset includes queries from Google and their corresponding Wikipedia pages, each with an annotated passage containing the answer. The authors specify that they used the version provided by ATLAS and mention the training, validation, and testing splits.

2. **TriviaQA**: This dataset contains question-answer pairs sourced from Wikipedia and the web, also provided by ATLAS, with specified training, validation, and testing splits.

I will also check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **NaturalQuestions (NQ)**, the citation is:
> Tom Kwiatkowski, Jennimaria Palomaki, Olivia Redfield, Michael Collins, Ankur Parikh, Chris Alberti, Danielle Epstein, Illia Polosukhin, Jacob Devlin, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova, Llion Jones, Matthew Kelcey, Ming-Wei Chang, Andrew M. Dai, Jakob Uszkoreit, Quoc Le, and Slav Petrov. *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:452–466, 2019.

For **TriviaQA**, the citation is:
> Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611, Vancouver, Canada, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which can be formatted as needed for further processing or review.
