To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Disentangling Identifiable Features from Noisy Data with Structured Nonlinear ICA" by Hermanni Hälvä et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions of the paper, and it may mention any datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including any references to prior works that may have introduced these datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors may discuss the performance of their method on these datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets' relevance and characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for any papers or resources that are cited in relation to the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will note the following details:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, types of data).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be easily referenced in future work.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets from the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
