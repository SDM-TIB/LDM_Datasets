To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MultiLegalSBD: A Multilingual Legal Sentence Boundary Detection Dataset" by Tobias Brugger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors curated a diverse multilingual legal dataset consisting of over 130,000 annotated sentences in six languages. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they created. They mention three primary multilingual legal datasets in French, Italian, and Spanish, each containing approximately 20,000 sentences. Additionally, they describe a smaller Portuguese dataset with around 1,800 sentences used for zero-shot experiments. 

The authors also mention that they standardized and integrated two publicly available datasets: one English collection of legal texts and one German dataset. This is crucial as it indicates that these datasets are part of their work and should be cited.

Now, I will gather the specific details for each dataset:

1. **Multilingual Legal Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 130,000 annotated sentences in six languages (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, English, and German). It includes judgments and laws from various legal areas.

2. **Portuguese Dataset**: A smaller dataset with approximately 1,800 sentences, divided into judgments and laws, used for zero-shot experiments.

3. **English Collection of Legal Texts**: This dataset is referenced from the work of Savelka et al. (2017), which includes adjudicatory decisions from the United States.

4. **German Dataset**: This dataset is referenced from the work of Glaser et al. (2021), comprising laws and judgments.

Next, I will look up the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **English Collection of Legal Texts**:
  > Savelka, J., Walker, V. R., Grabmair, M., & Ashley, K. D. (2017). Sentence Boundary Detection in Adjudicatory Decisions in the United States. TAL, 58(21).

- For the **German Dataset**:
  > Glaser, I., Moser, S., & Matthes, F. (2021). Sentence Boundary Detection in German Legal Documents. In Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence. SCITEPRESS, 812â€“821. https://doi.org/10.5220/0010246308120821

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources from the paper.
