To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RECALL: Replay-based Continual Learning in Semantic Segmentation" by Andrea Maracani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "web-crawled data" and "a generative adversarial network" for retrieving images, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** sections, particularly sections that discuss the experimental setup and datasets used. I will pay close attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets," "Experiments," or similar headings.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss their evaluation on the **Pascal VOC 2012 dataset**. This is a well-known dataset for semantic segmentation tasks, and it is crucial to note its details. The paper also references the use of **ImageNet** for pre-training the generative model, which is another important dataset to document.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will extract are:

1. For **Pascal VOC 2012**:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012 (VOC2012) Results*. http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2012/workshop/index.html.

2. For **ImageNet**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
