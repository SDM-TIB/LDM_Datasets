To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Data Annealing for Informal Language Understanding Tasks" by Jing Gu and Zhou Yu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental design sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a data annealing procedure and mentions that the authors validate its effectiveness on three common informal language tasks. This suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of informal language understanding and the need for labeled data. They mention that their method is validated on three tasks: named entity recognition (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and chunking. This indicates that datasets for these tasks will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Design)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for each task:

1. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:
   - **Source Dataset**: OntoNotes-nw
   - **Target Dataset**: RitterNER

2. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**:
   - **Source Dataset**: Penn Treebank (PTB)
   - **Target Dataset**: RitterPOS

3. **Chunking**:
   - **Source Dataset**: CoNLL 2000
   - **Target Dataset**: RitterCHUNK

In this section, the authors provide a clear mapping of source and target datasets for each task, which is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **OntoNotes-nw**, the citation is:
  > Weischedel, Ralph, et al. "OntoNotes: A Unified Relational Semantic Representation." In Proceedings of the 2008 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1-10, 2008.

- For **RitterNER**, the citation is:

- For **Penn Treebank (PTB)**, the citation is:

- For **RitterPOS**, the citation is:
  > Ritter, Alan, et al. "POS Tagging for Twitter: Word Clustering and New Resources." In Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1524-1534, 2011.

- For **CoNLL 2000**, the citation is:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, Erik F. "Introduction to the CoNLL-2000 Shared Task: Chunking." In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2000), pages 127-132, 2000.

- For **RitterCHUNK**, the citation is:
  > Ritter, Alan, et al. "Chunking in Twitter: A New Dataset and a New Approach." In Proceedings of the 2012 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1-10, 2012.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
