To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Planning-based Reasoning via Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing" by Chengwei Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their purposes, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors mention two datasets used for logical reasoning: 

1. **ReClor Dataset**: This dataset is described as a reading comprehension dataset requiring logical reasoning, with a total of 12,567 training questions and an average of 6 correct solutions per question.

2. **LogiQA-v2 Dataset**: This dataset is also a logical reasoning benchmark, with 4,638 training questions and an average of 5 correct solutions per question.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **GSM8K** and **MATH** datasets for mathematical reasoning, which are commonly used benchmarks in the field.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **ReClor Dataset**:
  > Yu, L., & Jiang, W. (2020). *ReClor: A Reading Comprehension Dataset Requiring Logical Reasoning*. In ICLR.

- For **LogiQA-v2 Dataset**:
  > Liu, H., Liu, J., Cui, L., Duan, N., Zhou, M., & Zhang, Y. (2022). *LogiQA2.0 Dataset - Logical Reasoning in MRC and NLI Tasks*. TASLP.

- For **GSM8K Dataset**:
  > Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., & Schulman, J. (2021). *Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems*. CoRR.

- For **MATH Dataset**:
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Kadavath, S., Arora, A., Basart, S., Tang, E., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring Mathematical Problem Solving with the MATH Dataset*. NeurIPS.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper.
