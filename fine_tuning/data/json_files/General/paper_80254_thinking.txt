To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Land Use Classification in Remote Sensing Images by Convolutional Neural Networks" by Marco Castelluccio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two remote sensing datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of land use classification and the need for effective datasets. They mention using two publicly available datasets, which is a strong indication that I will find their names and details in the subsequent sections.

I will then examine **section IV (Using CNNs for Remote Sensing Scene Classification)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **UC Merced Land Use Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,100 aerial optical images, categorized into 21 land use classes, with 100 images per class. The authors note that this dataset has been widely used in the literature, making it a reliable choice for comparison.

2. **Brazilian Coffee Scenes Dataset**: Released in 2015, this dataset includes over 50,000 labeled tiles from satellite images, categorized into coffee and non-coffee classes. The authors highlight the unique characteristics of this dataset, such as its use of infrared bands.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations I find are:

- For the **UC Merced Land Use Dataset**:
  > Yang, Y., & Newsam, S. (2010). Bag-of-visual-words and spatial extensions for land-use classification. In *International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems* (pp. 270–279).

- For the **Brazilian Coffee Scenes Dataset**:
  > Penatti, O. A. B., Nogueira, K., & dos Santos, J. A. (2015). Do deep features generalize from everyday objects to remote sensing and aerial scenes domains? In *IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops* (pp. 44–51).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
