To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HouseDiffusion: Vector Floorplan Generation via a Diffusion Model with Discrete and Continuous Denoising" by Mohammad Amin Shabani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluated their approach on the **RPLAN dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors mention using **60,000 vector floorplans from the RPLAN dataset**. This confirms that RPLAN is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the RPLAN dataset. The paper cites the RPLAN dataset as follows:
> Wenming Wu, Xiao-Ming Fu, Rui Tang, Yuhan Wang, Yu-Hao Qi, and Ligang Liu. *Data-driven interior plan generation for residential buildings*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 38(6):1â€“12, 2019.

Since RPLAN is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

The dataset entry will include the name of the dataset, a description of its contents, and the full citation. 

After completing this process, I will ensure that the dataset entry is ready for review or further processing.
