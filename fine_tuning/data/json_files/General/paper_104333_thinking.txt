To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit and Explicit Attention for Zero-Shot Learning" by Faisal Alamri and Anjan Dutta, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three popular benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note the names of these datasets as I encounter them.

In the **introduction**, the authors summarize their contributions and mention the datasets again, reinforcing their importance in the experiments. I will look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of images, classes, and attributes.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets: 

1. **AWA2**: The authors describe it as consisting of 37,322 images across 50 categories (40 seen and 10 unseen), with 85 binary and continuous class attributes.

2. **CUB**: This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 different bird species, with 150 classes considered seen and 50 unseen, along with 312 attributes.

3. **SUN**: The SUN dataset is noted for having the largest number of classes, with 14,340 images across 717 types of scenes, divided into 645 seen and 72 unseen classes, and it includes 102 annotated attributes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **AWA2**, the citation is:
  > Xian, Y., Lampert, C.H., Schiele, B., & Akata, Z. (2017). Zero-shot learning - the good, the bad and the ugly. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Tech. rep., California Institute of Technology.

- For **SUN**, the citation is:
  > Patterson, G., & Hays, J. (2012). Sun attribute database: Discovering, annotating, and recognizing scene attributes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research paper.
