To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Structured Instance Graph for Distilling Object Detectors" by Yixin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art results on the **COCO object detection task**, which indicates that the COCO dataset is likely used. I will note this down as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets employed for their experiments. I will carefully read through this section to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors state they conducted experiments on the **COCO dataset**. They mention training and validating their models on the **train/val2017** splits of COCO, which contains around 118k training images and 5k validation images. This confirms that COCO is indeed a dataset used in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the COCO dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

In summary, the steps I took to extract the dataset information are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Review the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Confirm the dataset used (COCO) and gather details about its splits.
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for COCO, ensuring it includes all necessary details and the full citation.
