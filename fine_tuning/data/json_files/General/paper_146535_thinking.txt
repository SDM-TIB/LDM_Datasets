To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Power of Convolution Augmented Transformer" by Mingchen Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a summary of the key contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the abstract discusses evaluations on real datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically outline the context of their work and may reference specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to validate their findings.

I will then examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. 

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide detailed descriptions of each dataset used in the study. I will note down the names, sizes, and any specific attributes of the datasets mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to include the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention using the **SlimPajama dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Daria Soboleva et al. *SlimPajama: A 627b token cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama*. 2023.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
