To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Breaking the Barriers of Data Scarcity in Drug-Target Affinity Prediction" by Qizhi Pei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets such as **BindingDB**, **DAVIS**, and **KIBA**. This indicates that these datasets are likely important for the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the datasets in the **Experimental Settings** section. Here, they provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) prediction:

1. **BindingDB**: This dataset is a public database of measured binding affinities, focusing on interactions of targets with small drug-like molecules. The authors mention that it contains 376,751 IC50-labeled samples, with 255,328 unique drugs and 2,782 unique targets.

2. **DAVIS**: This dataset contains selectivity assays of the kinase protein family and relevant inhibitors with their respective dissociation constant (Kd) values. It has 30,056 DTA pairs with 68 unique drugs and 379 unique targets.

3. **KIBA**: This dataset includes kinase inhibitor bioactivities measured in three metrics: Ki, Kd, and IC50. The final KIBA dataset used in the study has 118,254 DTA pairs with 2,068 unique drugs and 229 unique targets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **BindingDB**:

- For **DAVIS**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets relevant to the research and their proper citations.
