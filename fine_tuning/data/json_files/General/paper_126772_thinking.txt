To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Clustering via Orthogonalization-Free Methods" by Qiyuan Pang and Haizhao Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their numerical experiments and the datasets used for testing their methods. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets mentioned.

In the **numerical results section**, the authors discuss three numerical experiments and mention specific datasets used for testing their methods. They refer to synthetic graphs from the "Synthetic Data for the Streaming Graph Challenge," categorizing them into four types based on block overlap and size variation. The specific datasets mentioned include:

1. **LBOLBSV(SG)-1M**: A synthetic graph with 1 million nodes in the Low Block Overlap and Low Block Size Variation category.
2. **LBOHBSV(SG)-5M**: A synthetic graph with 5 million nodes in the Low Block Overlap and High Block Size Variation category.
3. **LBOHBSV(SG)-20M**: A synthetic graph with 20 million nodes in the High Block Overlap and Low Block Size Variation category.
4. **MAWI-Graph-1**: Traffic data from the MAWI Project.
5. **Graph500-scale24-ef16**: Synthetic graph data generated using the scalable Graph500 Kronecker generator.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and part of a challenge, they may not have formal citations like traditional datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are derived from the "Synthetic Data for the Streaming Graph Challenge" and provide the relevant URL for reference.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format, ensuring that I include all necessary details for each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
