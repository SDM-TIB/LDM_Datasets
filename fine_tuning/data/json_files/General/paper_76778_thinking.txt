To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised Adversarial Learning to Generate Photorealistic Face Images of New Identities from 3D Morphable Model" by Baris Gecer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on two datasets: **LFW** and **IJB-A**. This is a good starting point for identifying datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **Implementation Details** section, where the authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **CASIA-Web Face Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 500,000 face images of around 10,000 individuals. It is used as the real face image dataset for training.

2. **300W-3D and AFLW2000-3D Datasets**: These datasets are used to create a paired training set consisting of 5,000 real images with their corresponding 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameter annotations. The authors render synthetic images using these parameters.

3. **Large Scale Face Model (LSFM)**: This dataset is used to generate synthetic face images, totaling around 500,000 images of 10,000 different identities.

4. **Face Warehouse Model**: This model is utilized for generating expressions in the synthetic dataset.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations I need to extract include:

- For **CASIA-Web Face Dataset**:

- For **300W-3D**:

- For **Large Scale Face Model (LSFM)**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
