To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-scale Efficient Graph-Transformer for Whole Slide Image Classification" by Saisai Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on two public WSI datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention two datasets: **TCGA-RCC** and **CAMELYON16**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **TCGA-RCC Dataset**: This dataset is used for Renal Cell Carcinoma classification and includes 914 slides collected from 876 cases, with three categories: KICH, KIRC, and KIRP.

2. **CAMELYON16 Dataset**: This dataset is for metastasis detection in breast cancer and consists of 270 training and 129 test slides.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **TCGA-RCC dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas: A Comprehensive Molecular Characterization of Human Breast Tumors*. Nature, vol. 490, pp. 61-70, 2012.

- For the **CAMELYON16 dataset**, the citation is:
  > B. E. Bejnordi, M. Veta, P. J. van Diest, et al. *Diagnostic Assessment of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Women with Breast Cancer*. JAMA, vol. 318, pp. 2199-2210, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
