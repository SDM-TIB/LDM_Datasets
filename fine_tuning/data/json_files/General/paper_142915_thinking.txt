To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-Distribution Detection Based on Subspace Projection of High-Dimensional Features Output by the Last Convolutional Layer" by Qiuyu Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method was evaluated on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Discussion)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using **SVHN** and **CIFAR-10/100** images for classification tasks. They also reference several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets used in their evaluations, including **TinyImageNet (crop)**, **TinyImageNet (resize)**, **LSUN (crop)**, **LSUN (resize)**, **iSUN**, and **SVHN**.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **SVHN** (Street View House Numbers):

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation.
