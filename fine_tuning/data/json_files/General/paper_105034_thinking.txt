To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improvised Aerial Object Detection approach for YOLOv3 Using Weighted Luminance" by Sai Ganesh CS et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of images acquired from LANDSAT 8 and NIOP satellite imagery, which suggests that these are key datasets for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **Research Methodology** section, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they specify that the images are obtained from LANDSAT 8 via Google Earth Engine, which consists of numerous images pertaining to five different classes: armed vehicles, aircraft, helicopters, tents, and ships/boats. This section also provides information about how the images are annotated and the training/testing split.

I will also check the **Experiments and Analysis** section for any additional details about the datasets used, such as the number of images per class and how they were processed. The paper includes a table (Table 2) that outlines the dataset size and classification, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the authors used LANDSAT 8 imagery, I will ensure to include the citation for the LANDSAT 8 dataset.

The citation for the LANDSAT 8 dataset is:
> USGS. (2013). *Landsat 8 Data Users Handbook*. U.S. Geological Survey. Retrieved from https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/landsat-8-data-users-handbook

Additionally, I will note that the NIOP satellite images are mentioned, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset. If no citation is available, I will document it as "NIOP satellite imagery (no citation provided)."

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
