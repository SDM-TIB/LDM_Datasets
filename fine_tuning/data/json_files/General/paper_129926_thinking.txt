To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-centric FinGPT: Democratizing Internet-scale Data for Financial Large Language Models" by Xiao-Yang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss data sources and experiments**. The abstract mentions the aim to democratize financial data and references the collection of data from diverse sources, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Demoncratizing Internet-scale Financial Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed overview of the various data sources utilized in their framework. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets.

In **subsection 4.1 (Financial Data Sources)**, the authors list several categories of data sources, including:

1. **Financial News**: They mention sources like Yahoo, Reuters, and Seeking Alpha, which are critical for gathering market-related information.
2. **Social Media Discussions**: Platforms such as Twitter and Reddit are highlighted as important for sentiment analysis.
3. **Company Filings**: The SEC and Juchao are noted as sources for official company filings.
4. **Research Datasets**: Specific datasets like Stocknet, CHRNN, TTE, Astock, FiQA SA, and FPB are mentioned.

I will extract the relevant details for each dataset listed in subsection 4.1, ensuring to note their descriptions and any specific characteristics mentioned.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For example, the paper references the following datasets:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
