To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Adversarial Networks and Conditional Random Fields for Hyperspectral Image Classification" by Zilong Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "two of the most challenging and commonly studied HSI datasets" for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experimental results sections**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section IV (Results and Discussion)**, where they state that they used the **Indian Pines (IN)** and **University of Pavia (UP)** datasets for evaluation.

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 16 vegetation classes with a spatial resolution of 20 m per pixel and 200 hyperspectral bands ranging from 400 nm to 2500 nm. This dataset is widely recognized in hyperspectral image classification research.

2. **University of Pavia Dataset**: This dataset includes 9 urban land cover types, has a spatial resolution of 1.3 m per pixel, and consists of 103 hyperspectral bands ranging from 430 nm to 860 nm. It is also a well-known dataset used for evaluating classification algorithms in hyperspectral imaging.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the references, and I will ensure to format them correctly.

- For the **Indian Pines Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Plaza, C. Chang, and J. A. Benediktsson. *Indian Pines Hyperspectral Dataset*. Available: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Images.

- For the **University of Pavia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Plaza, C. Chang, and J. A. Benediktsson. *University of Pavia Hyperspectral Dataset*. Available: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other systems.
