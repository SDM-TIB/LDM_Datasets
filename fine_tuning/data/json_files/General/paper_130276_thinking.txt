To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Practical Robustness Auditing for Linear Regression" by Daniel Freund and Samuel B. Hopkins, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the empirical study of algorithms on various datasets, which suggests that there are datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and results. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for their analysis. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant citations.

In the experiments section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Microcredit Studies**: This refers to a collection of randomized control trials involving microcredit loans in developing countries. The authors note that these studies involve regression analyses with thousands of samples.

2. **Boston Housing Dataset**: A well-known dataset used for regression problems, which is referenced multiple times throughout the paper.

3. **Incarceration Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze the effects of the end of Jim Crow on incarceration rates, with specific details provided about its dimensions and sample size.

4. **GDP and Democracy Dataset**: This dataset investigates the relationship between political freedom and economic growth, also with specific details about its dimensions and sample size.

5. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generate synthetic datasets for their experiments, specifically mentioning a 2D and a 4D synthetic dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper documentation and attribution.

The citations I will look for include:

- For the **Microcredit Studies**, I will reference the survey by Meager (2022) that discusses multiple randomized control trials.
  
- For the **Boston Housing Dataset**, I will cite the original paper by Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978).

- For the **Incarceration Dataset**, I will reference the work by Eubank and Fresh (2022).

- For the **GDP and Democracy Dataset**, I will cite the paper by Martinez (2022).

- For the **Synthetic Datasets**, since they are generated by the authors, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of this study.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
