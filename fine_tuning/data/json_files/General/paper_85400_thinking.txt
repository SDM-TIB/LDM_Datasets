To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Optimize TSK Fuzzy Systems for Classification Problems: Mini-Batch Gradient Descent with Uniform Regularization and Batch Normalization" by Yuqi Cui, Dongrui Wu, and Jian Huang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets section** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **12 UCI datasets from various application domains**, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **Section A (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. They list the datasets along with their characteristics, including the number of samples, features, and classes. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Vehicle**: 846 samples, 18 features, 4 classes.
2. **Biodeg**: 1,055 samples, 41 features, 2 classes.
3. **DRD**: 1,151 samples, 19 features, 2 classes.
4. **Yeast**: 1,484 samples, 8 features, 10 classes.
5. **Steel**: 1,941 samples, 27 features, 7 classes.
6. **IS**: 2,310 samples, 19 features, 7 classes.
7. **Abalone**: 4,177 samples, 10 features, 3 classes.
8. **Waveform21**: 5,000 samples, 21 features, 3 classes.
9. **Page-blocks**: 5,473 samples, 10 features, 5 classes.
10. **Satellite**: 6,435 samples, 36 features, 6 classes.
11. **Clave**: 10,798 samples, 16 features, 4 classes.
12. **MAGIC**: 19,020 samples, 10 features, 2 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The datasets are sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and the citations will typically include the dataset title, the authors (if available), and the URL for access.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
