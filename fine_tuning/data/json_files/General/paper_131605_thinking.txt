To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Early Exiting Predictive Coding Neural Networks" by Alaa Zniber et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved comparable accuracy to VGG-16 in image classification on CIFAR-10, which indicates that the CIFAR-10 dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, particularly the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **CIFAR-10 dataset** in section IV (Experiments). They describe it as containing 60,000 32x32 RGB images evenly distributed over 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This detailed description confirms that CIFAR-10 is the primary dataset used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any further processing or review.
