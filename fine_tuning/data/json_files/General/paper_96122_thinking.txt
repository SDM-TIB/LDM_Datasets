To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Early Life Cycle Software Defect Prediction" by N.C. Shrikanth, Suvodeep Majumder, and Tim Menzies, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions analyzing hundreds of popular GitHub projects, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these projects. I will look for specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention using a tool called **Commit Guru** to extract data from GitHub repositories. I will note the characteristics of the data they collected, such as the number of projects, commits, and any specific criteria for selecting these projects.

In the **results** section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in their experiments. The authors provide details about the projects they analyzed, including the number of commits and the criteria for inclusion (e.g., projects with at least 1000 stars, a minimum number of defects, etc.). This information is crucial for understanding the datasets.

I will also check the **acknowledgments** and **references** sections for any additional datasets mentioned or cited. The references may include original sources for the datasets or tools used, which is important for providing full citations.

Based on my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **GitHub Projects Dataset**: This dataset includes 155 long-running open-source projects from GitHub, selected based on specific criteria (e.g., at least 1000 stars, at least 1% defects, etc.). The authors mention that this dataset contains a total of 3,728 commits.

2. **Commit Guru Data**: This dataset is derived from the Commit Guru tool, which processes GitHub repositories to extract commit data. The authors describe the features extracted from the commits, which are used for defect prediction.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the **Commit Guru** tool is as follows:
- Rosen, C., Grawi, B., & Shihab, E. (2015). Commit Guru: Analytics and risk prediction of software commits. In Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering (pp. 966–969). ACM.

For the **GitHub Projects Dataset**, since it is based on the authors' own analysis of GitHub projects, I will cite the paper itself as the source:
- Shrikanth, N.C., Majumder, S., & Menzies, T. (2020). Early Life Cycle Software Defect Prediction. In Proceedings of the 2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP) (pp. 182–190). IEEE.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations for further processing or review.
