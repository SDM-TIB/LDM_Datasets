To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Synthetic vascular structure generation for unsupervised pre-training in CTA segmentation tasks" by Nil Stolt Ans√≥, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the research involves a set of 4D CTA scans belonging to stroke patients, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** of the paper, which is explicitly labeled as such. Here, the author describes the datasets used in the research:

1. **Labeled Data Set**: This dataset consists of 4D CTA scans from 24 stroke patients, where each scan has a single 3D ground truth created by manual labeling. The author mentions that the final training set contains 243 3D scans from 20 patients, with specific details about how the scans were selected based on the presence and clarity of vessels.

2. **Unlabeled Data Set**: This dataset includes 33 stroke patients whose scans do not have labeled ground truths. The author explains that the first time frame from each unlabeled patient was used to create synthetic vessel data.

Additionally, the author discusses the augmentation of both datasets through various transformations, which is important for understanding how the datasets were prepared for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are derived from the author's own research and not from previously published datasets, there may not be external citations for them. Instead, I will note that the labeled dataset is based on the author's own manual segmentation work.

In summary, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **Labeled Data Set**: 
   - Description: 4D CTA scans from 24 stroke patients with manually labeled ground truths. The training set consists of 243 3D scans from 20 patients.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from the author's own work).

2. **Unlabeled Data Set**: 
   - Description: 4D CTA scans from 33 stroke patients without labeled ground truths. The first time frame from each patient was used to create synthetic vessel data.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from the author's own work).

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
