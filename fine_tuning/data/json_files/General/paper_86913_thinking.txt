To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embedded Bayesian Network Classifiers" by David Heckerman and Christopher Meek, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any references to datasets. The abstract discusses a new probability model for discrete Bayesian networks but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the theoretical aspects of Bayesian networks without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain details about the datasets used for validation or testing. However, upon reviewing the provided text, it appears that there are no specific datasets mentioned in these sections either. The paper primarily discusses theoretical models and algorithms without referencing empirical datasets.

Since the paper does not provide any datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the references listed are primarily focused on theoretical contributions and do not include specific datasets.

Given that no datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset entries or citations.

In summary, I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, but it appears that the focus is on theoretical models rather than empirical validation with specific datasets. As a result, there are no datasets to report or cite.
