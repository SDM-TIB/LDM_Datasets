To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recurrent Affine Transformation for Text-to-image Synthesis" by Senmao Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **CUB, Oxford-102, and COCO datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **CUB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200 categories with a total of 11,788 images of birds. The authors specify that they split the images into class-disjoint training and test sets, using 150 classes for training and 50 for testing.

2. **Oxford-102 Dataset**: This dataset contains 102 categories with 8,189 images of flowers. Similar to the CUB dataset, the authors mention that they split the images into training and test sets, using 82 for training and 20 for testing.

3. **MS COCO Dataset**: This dataset includes 123,287 images, each with 5 sentence annotations. The authors state that they used the official training and validation splits for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **CUB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., & Perona, P. (2010). *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 Dataset*. 

- For the **Oxford-102 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nilsback, M.-E., & Zisserman, A. (2008). *Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes*. In Proceedings of the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing.

- For the **MS COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & Doll√°r, P. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the specified requirements for downstream processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the citations are complete and accurate.
