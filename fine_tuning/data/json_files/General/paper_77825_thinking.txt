To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-ESN: A Multiple Projection-encoding Hierarchical Reservoir Computing Framework" by Qianli Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **Mackey-Glass System (MGS)**: This is a classical time series used for evaluating dynamical system identification methods. The authors generated a 10,000-length time series from the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation.

2. **NARMA System**: A tenth-order nonlinear autoregressive moving average system, which is known for its complexity and difficulty in identification. The authors generated a NARMA time series with a total length of 4,000.

3. **Monthly Sunspot Series**: This dataset consists of sunspot numbers, which are used to evaluate the capability of time-series prediction models. The authors used data from July 1749 to November 2016, totaling 3,198 observations.

4. **Daily Minimum Temperatures**: This dataset contains daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne, Australia, from January 1, 1981, to December 31, 1990, totaling 3,650 sample points.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. If the datasets are publicly available, I will also note the sources or links provided by the authors.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Mackey-Glass System**: The dataset is generated from the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation, which is a well-known mathematical model in time series analysis. The original reference for the equation can be cited as:
  > Mackey, M. C., & Glass, L. (1977). Oscillation and chaos in physiological control systems. *Science*, 197(4300), 287-289.

- **NARMA System**: The NARMA dataset is based on the nonlinear autoregressive moving average model, which can be referenced as:
  > NARMA System Reference: (specific reference not provided in the paper, but it is commonly cited in literature related to time series prediction).

- **Monthly Sunspot Series**: The dataset is sourced from the SILSO World Data Center, which can be cited as:
  > SILSO World Data Center. (2016). The international sunspot number. *International Sunspot Number Monthly Bulletin and online catalogue*. Retrieved from http://www.sidc.be/SILSO/

- **Daily Minimum Temperatures**: The dataset can be referenced as:
  > Melbourne Library. (1981-1990). Daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne, Australia. Retrieved from https://datamarket.com/data/set/2324/daily-minimum-temperatures-in-melbourne-australia-1981-1990

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
