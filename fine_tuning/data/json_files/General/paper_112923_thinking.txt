To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utilizing Class Separation Distance for the Evaluation of Corruption Robustness of Machine Learning Classifiers" by Georg Siedel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a method for evaluating classifier robustness but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (Section 3) and the **experimental details section** (Section 3.2). These sections typically contain information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on a **2D dataset** and the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. 

In Section 3.2, the authors describe the experimental setup, indicating that they used the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification tasks. They also mention using a **2D dataset** for binary classification experiments. 

Now, I will look for the **results section** (Section 4) to confirm the datasets used and any relevant details about them. The results section discusses the performance of classifiers on both datasets, providing insights into the outcomes of the experiments.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can infer the following:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, commonly cited as:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **2D Dataset**: The paper references experiments conducted on a 2D dataset, but it does not provide a specific citation. I will note that this dataset may refer to datasets commonly used in robustness studies, but without a specific reference, I cannot provide a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset and noting the lack of a citation for the 2D dataset. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
