To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XLDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis for Scaling Continual Learning to Extreme Classification at the Edge" by Karan Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "extreme datasets like AliProducts (50k classes) and Google Landmarks V2 (81k classes)," indicating that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors likely provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that elaborate on their characteristics.

In **Table 5**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets, including the number of classes and samples for each dataset. The datasets listed are:

1. **CalTech Birds (2011)**: 200 classes, 6,000 samples.
2. **ImageNet-1K (2012)**: 1,000 classes, 1.3 million samples.
3. **iNaturalist**: 8,100 classes, 500,000 samples.
4. **AliProducts v1**: 50,000 classes, 2.5 million samples.
5. **Google Landmarks v2 - Clean**: 81,000 classes, 1.4 million samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
