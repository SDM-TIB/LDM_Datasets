To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer based ensemble for emotion detection" by Aditya Kane et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an ensemble of models for emotion detection, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction references an extended version of the Ekman dataset, indicating that this is one of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset they used. They mention a dataset consisting of 1860 data points, classified into seven emotions. This dataset is crucial for understanding their experiments. They also discuss the class imbalance and the need for data augmentation, which leads me to look for additional datasets mentioned.

The authors state that they used the **GoEmotions dataset** to address class imbalance. This dataset is significant as it provides additional context for their experiments. They describe three data augmentation techniques based on the GoEmotions dataset, which indicates its importance in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Ekman Dataset**: The citation for the original dataset is:
   > Paul Ekman. 1992. An argument for basic emotions. *Cognition and Emotion*, 6(3-4):169â€“200.

2. **GoEmotions Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dorottya Demszky, Dana Movshovitz-Attias, Jeongwoo Ko, Alan Cowen, Gaurav Nemade, and Sujith Ravi. 2020. Goemotions: A dataset of fine-grained emotions. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00547*.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
