To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Methods for Simulation-Based Inference" by Manuel GlÃ¶ckler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and applications, which may include references to datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using a **neuroscience model of the pyloric network** in the crab Cancer borealis. They refer to a dataset that includes empirical observations and summary statistics derived from simulations. The specific details about the dataset are crucial for proper citation.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is important for ensuring that I provide accurate and complete references for each dataset.

From my review, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Pyloric Network Dataset**: This dataset consists of empirical observations from the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis, which includes 15 summary statistics of the pyloric rhythm. The dataset is referenced in the paper as being publicly available.

2. **Two Moons Simulator Dataset**: This dataset is used as a benchmark example to illustrate the capabilities of the Sequential Neural Variational Inference (SNVI) method. It is a synthetic dataset generated by a simulator that produces a bimodal posterior distribution.

3. **Bernoulli GLM Dataset**: This dataset is part of the SBI benchmark tasks used to evaluate the performance of the SNVI method. It consists of generalized linear model data with Bernoulli observations.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
