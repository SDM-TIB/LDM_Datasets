To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geoopt: Riemannian Optimization in PyTorch" by Max Kochurov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the Geoopt package and its capabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the motivation behind the package and its applications in geometric deep learning, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **implementation details** and **features** sections. These sections describe the functionalities of Geoopt and the types of manifolds and optimizers it supports. However, they do not reference any datasets either.

I will then look into the **advanced usage** and **other applications** sections. Here, the authors discuss various applications of Riemannian optimization in different fields such as language models, computer vision, and time series analysis. They mention several works and methods but do not provide specific datasets used in their experiments.

Finally, I will check the **References section** for any citations that might indicate datasets used in the context of the discussed applications. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets used for their experiments or implementations. Instead, they focus on the theoretical aspects and applications of the Geoopt package without providing specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed the steps of identifying their names, descriptions, and retrieving full citations from the references section.

In summary, I will document that no datasets were found in this paper, and therefore, there are no citations to provide.
