To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GIF: Generative Interpretable Faces" by Partha Ghosh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors use a dataset of approximately **65,500 high-quality face images** paired with corresponding FLAME parameters. This indicates that there is a significant dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Training data)**, where the authors provide specific information about the dataset used for training their model. Here, they explicitly state that their dataset consists of **Flickr images (FFHQ)**, which were introduced in StyleGAN. This is a crucial piece of information, as it identifies the dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FFHQ dataset. The citation for the FFHQ dataset is:
> T. Karras, S. Laine, and T. Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401â€“4410, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the FFHQ dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. The dataset entry will be structured accordingly, ready for further processing or review.
