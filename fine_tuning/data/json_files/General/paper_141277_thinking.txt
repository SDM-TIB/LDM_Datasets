To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Misleading Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Selective Filtering" by Yexin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on several datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, I will look for the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that define them.

The paper mentions three datasets:

1. **ScienceQA**: This dataset is described as a multimodal benchmark consisting of multiple-choice questions related to science topics, annotated with corresponding lectures and explanations. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tony Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan. *Learn to explain: Multimodal reasoning via thought chains for science question answering*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2209.09513, 2022.

2. **ECQA**: This dataset is a human-annotated version of CommonsenseQA, which assesses general commonsense reasoning. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 4149â€“4158, 2019.

3. **LastLetter**: This dataset is constructed from the Google-10000-English repository and involves a task of concatenating the last letters of given words. The citation for this dataset is:
   > The dataset is constructed by the authors and does not have a formal citation, but it is based on the Google-10000-English repository.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note any additional details provided in the paper, such as the number of instances or specific characteristics that may be relevant for understanding how these datasets were used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
