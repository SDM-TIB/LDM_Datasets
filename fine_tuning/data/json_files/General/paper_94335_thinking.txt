To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Mixtures of Low-Rank Models" by Yanxi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as a dedicated **"Datasets"** or **"Experiments"** section. In this paper, I will focus on sections that describe the empirical studies, as they typically include the datasets used.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, types of data). If the datasets are not explicitly named, I will look for descriptions that could help identify them.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if I find that the paper uses the **Penn Action Dataset**, I will note the details such as the number of video clips and the type of annotations provided. I will then look up the citation for this dataset, which might be something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
