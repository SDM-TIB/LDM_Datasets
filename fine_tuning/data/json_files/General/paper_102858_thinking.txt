To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probeable DARTS with Application to Computational Pathology" by Sheyang Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention applying their method to a histological tissue type dataset referred to as **ADP**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) to gather more details about the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **ADP dataset** and provide a comparison with other datasets such as **BCSS**, **BACH**, and **Osteosarcoma**. This suggests that these datasets are also relevant for extraction.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset in the **supplementary material**, particularly in the **Dataset Details** section. Here, the authors describe the **ADP dataset** as a multi-label dataset with a resolution of 272x272, and they mention that it contains a variety of histological tissue types. They also state that the **BCSS** dataset is multi-label, while **BACH** and **Osteosarcoma** are single-label datasets, all with the same resolution.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to find the appropriate citations:

1. **ADP Dataset**:
   - Citation:

Plataniotis, and Savvas Damaskinos. *Atlas of digital pathology: A generalized hierarchical histological tissue type-annotated database for deep learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 11747–11756, 2019.

2. **BCSS Dataset**:
   - Citation:

3. **BACH Dataset**:
   - Citation:

4. **Osteosarcoma Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
