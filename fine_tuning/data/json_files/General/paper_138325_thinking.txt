To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Addressing Bias Through Ensemble Learning and Regularized Fine-Tuning" by Ahmed Radwan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach through experiments on the **CIFAR10** and **HAM10000** datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more specific information about each dataset. In the experiments, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes. The authors mention that they sampled 25 images from each class to create a personalized dataset for their experiments. They also provide details about the training process, including the use of a pre-trained model and the specific architecture (Densenet121) that yielded the best results.

2. **HAM10000**: This dataset contains 10,000 images representing seven classes of skin lesions. The authors used 8,405 images for training and 1,500 images for testing. They also highlight the use of the same model architecture (Densenet121) for this dataset, along with the training parameters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoff Hinton. *Convolutional deep belief networks on CIFAR-10*. Unpublished manuscript, 40(7):1–9, 2010.

- For **HAM10000**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Tschandl, Cliff Rosendahl, and Harald Kittler. *The HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions*. Scientific data, 5(1):1–9, 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
