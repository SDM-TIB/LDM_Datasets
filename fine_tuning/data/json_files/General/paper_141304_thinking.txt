To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRKD: Enhanced Camera-Radar Object Detection with Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation" by Lingjun Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive evaluations on the **nuScenes dataset**. This indicates that the nuScenes dataset is likely a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly the **experiments** section. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **nuScenes dataset**. I will take note of any details provided about this dataset, such as its characteristics, size, and any specific splits used for training and validation.

I will also check the **related works** section to see if there are any references to other datasets that might have been used in prior studies or comparisons. However, the primary focus here is on the datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the nuScenes dataset, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for this dataset. The citation for the nuScenes dataset is as follows:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset details along with the full citation.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify any datasets mentioned.
2. Look for explicit mentions of datasets in the experiments section.
3. Check the references for full citations of the identified datasets.
4. Document the dataset details and citations clearly.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
