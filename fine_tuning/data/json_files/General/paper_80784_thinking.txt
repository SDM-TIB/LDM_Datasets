To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Wikipedia-Based Cross-Language Retrieval Models" by Benjamin Roth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the author mentions three corpora used for retrieval experiments:

1. **Wiki-Subset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 articles from Wikipedia, used for thematical correspondence tasks. It is important to note the specific nature of this dataset as it relates to the experiments conducted.

2. **Multext JOC**: This corpus contains 3,500 questions and answers from the European Parliament, with a focus on translations. The dataset is significant for evaluating cross-language retrieval methods.

3. **CLEF2000**: This dataset includes 110,000 English newspaper articles and 33 German queries, used for query-based text retrieval. This dataset is crucial for assessing the performance of the proposed models in a real-world scenario.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Wiki-Subset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is derived from the author's own assembly of Wikipedia articles.

- For **Multext JOC**, the citation is:
  > S.F. Adafre and M. de Rijke. *Finding similar sentences across multiple languages in Wikipedia*. In Proceedings of the 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 62â€“69, 2006.

- For **CLEF2000**, the citation is:
  > C. Peters and M. Braschler. *European Research Letter: cross-language system evaluation: the CLEF campaigns*. Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 52(12), 2001.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
