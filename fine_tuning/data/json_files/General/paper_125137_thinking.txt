To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Object Rigidity: Competition and cooperation between motion-energy and feature-tracking mechanisms and shape-based priors" by Akihito Maruya and Qasim Zaidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including any datasets utilized. In this paper, the authors describe the creation of various stimuli (e.g., circular rings with different configurations) and the methods used to analyze the visual perception of rigidity. I will look for any references to datasets or specific stimuli that were used in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any mention of datasets used for analysis or comparison. The authors may discuss the performance of their models or experiments in relation to specific datasets, which would be crucial for my extraction.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I anticipate that the datasets may include:
1. **Stimuli used in the experiments**: The authors created various shapes and configurations of rings to test rigidity perception. I will note the specific configurations and any relevant details.
2. **Data from observers**: The paper mentions measurements taken from observers regarding their perceptions of rigidity and non-rigidity. I will look for any datasets related to these measurements.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
