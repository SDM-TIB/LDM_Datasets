To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STEER: Unified Style Transfer with Expert Reinforcement" by Skyler Hallinan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "challenging dataset with text from a diverse set of styles," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Corpus of Diverse Styles (CDS)**: This dataset is described as a non-parallel, diverse text corpus with 11 distinct styles, including Shakespeare and the Bible.

2. **Grammarly’s Yahoo Answers Formality Corpus (GYAFC)**: This is a parallel corpus of formal and informal responses collected from the Yahoo Answers forum.

3. **Yelp Review Dataset (Yelp)**: This dataset consists of user reviews on various businesses and services from Yelp, annotated with binary sentiment ratings of positive or negative.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **Corpus of Diverse Styles (CDS)**, the citation is:
  > Krishna, K., Wieting, J., & Iyyer, M. (2020). Reformulating unsupervised style transfer as paraphrase generation. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 737–762.

- For **Grammarly’s Yahoo Answers Formality Corpus (GYAFC)**, the citation is:
  > Rao, S., & Tetreault, J. R. (2018). Dear sir or madam, may I introduce the GYAFC dataset: Corpus, benchmarks and metrics for formality style transfer. In North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **Yelp Review Dataset (Yelp)**, the citation is:
  > Shen, T., Lei, T., Barzilay, R., & Jaakkola, T. (2017). Style transfer from non-parallel text by cross-alignment. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 866–876.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
