To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic approach to limited-data computed tomography reconstruction" by Zenith Purisha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, they mention using both **simulated data** (specifically, a 2D chest phantom dataset) and **real data** (a carved cheese dataset). 

1. **Simulated Data: 2D Chest Phantom**: The authors state that they used one slice of Matlab’s 3D Chest dataset as a ground truth for their simulations. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

2. **Real Data: Carved Cheese**: The authors also mention using a dataset of a carved cheese slice measured with a custom-built CT device. They provide a link to where this dataset can be accessed online.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **3D Chest dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Segment lungs from 3-D chest scan and calculate lung volume." MATLAB documentation. Available at: https://se.mathworks.com/help/images/segment-lungs-from-3-d-chest-mri-data.html. Accessed: 2018-07-09.

- For the **carved cheese dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bubba, T. A., Juvonen, M., Lehtonen, J., März, M., Meaney, A., Purisha, Z., & Siltanen, S. (2017). *Tomographic x-ray data of carved cheese*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.05732.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
