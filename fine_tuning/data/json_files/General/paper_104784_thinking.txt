To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quantifying Cognitive Factors in Lexical Decline" by David Francis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for analysis.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their approach and the historical data they utilize. They mention using historical data across three languages (English, French, and German), which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these languages.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly section 4, where the authors describe their approach to selecting declining and stable words. They mention using the **Google Ngrams dataset** to identify words that have declined in frequency over time. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

In section 4.2, the authors detail how they selected their word pairs, indicating that they have curated sets of declining and stable words for English, French, and German. They specify that they have 300 declining words for English and French, and 250 for German, which are derived from the Google Ngrams dataset.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Google Ngrams dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Michel, J.-B., Shen, Y. K., Aiden, A. P., Veres, A., Gray, M. K., Pickett, J. P., Hoiberg, D., Clancy, D., Norvig, P., Orwant, J., et al. (2011). Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books. *Science*, 331(6014), 176–182.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention using the **Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE)** for the number of meanings of words, which is another dataset they reference. The citation for this dataset is:
> Kay, C., Alexander, M., Dallachy, F., Roberts, J., Samuels, M., & Wotherspoon, I. (2019). The Historical Thesaurus of English, version 4.21. University of Glasgow.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:
1. **Google Ngrams dataset**: Used to identify declining and stable words across English, French, and German.
   - Citation: Michel, J.-B., Shen, Y. K., Aiden, A. P., Veres, A., Gray, M. K., Pickett, J. P., Hoiberg, D., Clancy, D., Norvig, P., Orwant, J., et al. (2011). Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books. *Science*, 331(6014), 176–182.

2. **Historical Thesaurus of English (HTE)**: Used for the number of meanings of words in English.
   - Citation: Kay, C., Alexander, M., Dallachy, F., Roberts, J., Samuels, M., & Wotherspoon, I. (2019). The Historical Thesaurus of English, version 4.21. University of Glasgow.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
