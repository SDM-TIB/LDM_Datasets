To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Evaluation Benchmark for Autoformalization in Lean4" by Aryan Gulati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a benchmark designed for Lean4, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved. The introduction further elaborates that the paper proposes a benchmark of **101 pairs of mathematical formal-informal statements across 17 different topics in math**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In the **Methodology and Results** section, the authors specify that they selected a dataset of **101 theorem statements from mathlib4**, a library of mathematical theorems formulated in Lean4. This is a clear identification of the dataset used in their evaluation.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset includes formal statements, their corresponding natural language informalizations, and the specific mathematical topics, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for mathlib4, but it is important to note that it is a well-known library in the Lean community. Therefore, I will reference the general source of mathlib4:

- For **mathlib4**, the citation is:
  > The Lean Community. *mathlib4: A community-driven library of formalized mathematics in Lean*. Available at: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will allow for clear communication of the dataset's relevance and source in the context of the research paper.
