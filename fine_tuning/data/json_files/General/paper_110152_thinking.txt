To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Different Losses for Deep Learning Image Colorization" by Coloma Ballester et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on image colorization and the evaluation of various loss functions, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Analysis)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they mention using the **COCO dataset** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision.

I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as its size, content, and any preprocessing steps mentioned. The authors state that the COCO dataset contains various natural images and is divided into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., and Zitnick, C. L. (2014). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the COCO dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the COCO dataset, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
