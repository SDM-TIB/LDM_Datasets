To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Data Augmentation Methods on Social Media Corpora" by Isabel Garcia Pietri and Kineret Stanley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors explore data augmentation techniques using two social media datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Data** section, which is explicitly labeled as section 3. Here, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **TRAC-2 Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Second Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC-2) and contains approximately 6,000 comments from YouTube, labeled for aggression identification and gendered aggression. The dataset is noted to be highly imbalanced, with specific class distributions provided.

2. **RtGender Dataset**: This dataset is provided by Stanford and consists of social media posts from various platforms, with annotations for sentiment and relevance. The authors mention that they focus on a subset of this dataset, which contains around 15,000 total posts, and also provide details about the class distributions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TRAC-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, R.; Ojha, A.; Malmasi, S.; Zampieri, M. (2020). Evaluating Aggression Identification in Social Media.

- For the **RtGender Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Voigt, R.; Jurgens, D.; Vinodkumar, P.; Jurafsky, D.; Tsvetkov, Y. (2018). RtGender: A Corpus for Studying Differential Responses to Gender.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset is described accurately, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
