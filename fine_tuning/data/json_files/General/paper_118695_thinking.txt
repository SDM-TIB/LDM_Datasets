To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causal Modeling of Soil Processes for Improved Generalization" by Somya Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of soil organic carbon and mentions a comparative analysis of soil organic carbon estimation models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the data they utilized. Here, they mention the **North Wyke Farm Platform** as the primary dataset. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including its characteristics and the types of data it contains.

In section 3.1, the authors provide a detailed description of the North Wyke Farm Platform dataset, stating that it includes observations from multiple fields with different land use types, covering various soil properties and management practices. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of soil organic carbon estimation.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the North Wyke Farm Platform dataset. The paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, but it does reference the website where the data can be accessed. I will note that the dataset is available at the North Wyke Farm Platform website.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation format for the dataset, I will summarize the information I have gathered:

1. **North Wyke Farm Platform Dataset**: This dataset includes high-resolution long-term data on soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and management practices collected from three pasture-based livestock farming systems. The data spans from 2012 to the present and is used to study the sustainability of different land use types.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the information I have extracted, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the source where the dataset can be accessed.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be formatted for further use or processing.
