To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A taxonomy of explanations to support Explainability-by-Design" by Niko Tsakalakis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets that are foundational to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or studies that utilize datasets.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, as it typically outlines the research design and may detail any datasets used for analysis or experimentation. This section is crucial for understanding how the authors applied their taxonomy and whether they used any specific datasets to validate their findings.

After that, I will review the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work. This could provide insights into the datasets that were instrumental in their analysis.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If I find any datasets, I will ensure to document them with their full citations, including authors, title, publication venue, and year, as this is essential for academic integrity and reproducibility.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyze the introduction for context and references to datasets.
3. Examine the methodology for details on datasets used in the research.
4. Review the results and discussion for any additional dataset references.
5. Consult the references section for full citations of identified datasets.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
