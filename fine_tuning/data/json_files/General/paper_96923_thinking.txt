To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Addressing Contradictions in Dialogue Modeling" by Yixin Nie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the **DialoguE COntradiction DEtection task (DECODE)** and mentions a new conversational dataset containing contradictory dialogues. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Task and Data)**, where the authors describe the data collection process and the dataset itself. Here, they mention that they collected **17,713 human-written contradicting dialogues**, with **4,121** of these verified by three annotators. This section provides a clear overview of the dataset's size and purpose.

In the same section, the authors detail the sources of the dialogues used for the DECODE dataset, which include:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: A dataset for knowledge-powered conversational agents.
2. **EMPATHETICDIALOGUES**: A dataset aimed at empathetic dialogue generation.
3. **Blended Skill Talk**: A dataset designed for evaluating conversational agents' ability to blend skills.
4. **ConvAI2**: A dataset from a conversational intelligence challenge.

I will also note that the authors provide a breakdown of the dataset sources and data splits in **Table 1**, which summarizes the number of dialogues collected from each source.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- **Wizard of Wikipedia**:
  > Dinan, E., Logacheva, V., Malykh, V., Urbanek, J., Miller, A., Shuster, K., Kiela, D., Szlam, A., & Weston, J. (2018). *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. In International Conference on Learning Representations.

- **EMPATHETICDIALOGUES**:

- **Blended Skill Talk**:

- **ConvAI2**:
  > Dinan, E., Shuster, K., & Weston, J. (2020). *The second conversational intelligence challenge (convai2)*. In The NeurIPS’18 Competition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
