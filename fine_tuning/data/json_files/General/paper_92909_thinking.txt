To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Segmentation of Non-Tumor Tissues in Glioma MR Brain Images Using Deformable Registration with Partial Convolutional Networks" by Zhongqiang Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **MICCAI BraTS2018 T1 tumor images** for evaluation, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look closely at the **methodology and results sections** to gather more details about the dataset. In the results section, the author mentions using **140 cases from MICCAI BraTS2018** for their experiments, which confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its use.

I will also check the **experimental settings** to see if there are any specific details about how the dataset was utilized. The author specifies that they used **T1-weighted and FLAIR images** from the BraTS2018 dataset for tumor segmentation, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in the study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the MICCAI BraTS2018 dataset. The citation is typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract it accurately.

The citation for the MICCAI BraTS2018 dataset is:
> Menze, B. H., Kelm, B. M., van der Laak, J. A., et al. "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." In *Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI)*, pp. 334-340, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation for the MICCAI BraTS2018 dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
