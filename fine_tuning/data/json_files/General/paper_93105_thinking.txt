To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive Multi-Scale Residual Network for Single Image Super-Resolution" by Yuqing Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on several benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of single image super-resolution (SISR) and reference various existing methods, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention that the proposed PMRN is trained with the **DIV2K dataset** and tested on several benchmarks, including **Set5**, **Set14**, **B100**, **Urban100**, and **Manga109**. 

I will now gather details about each dataset:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is highlighted as a high-quality dataset with 2K resolution images, consisting of 800 training images, 100 validation images, and 100 test images. 

2. **Set5**: This is a commonly used benchmark dataset for image super-resolution, consisting of 5 images.

3. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset that includes 14 images, often used for evaluating super-resolution methods.

4. **B100**: This dataset contains 100 images and is also used for benchmarking super-resolution algorithms.

5. **Urban100**: This dataset consists of 100 images of urban scenes, specifically designed for testing super-resolution methods.

6. **Manga109**: This dataset includes 109 manga images and is used for evaluating super-resolution techniques on comic-style images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Manga109**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
