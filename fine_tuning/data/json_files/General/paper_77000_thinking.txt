To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HENet: A Highly Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks Optimized for Accuracy, Speed and Storage" by Qiuyu Zhu and Ruixin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model's efficiency is evaluated on several open-source datasets, specifically **CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly describe:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32×32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It also has 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning algorithms. The authors mention using 31×31 size images as input without any data augmentation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky A. Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images. Tech Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Netzer Y, et al. Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning. Nips Workshop on Deep Learning & Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
