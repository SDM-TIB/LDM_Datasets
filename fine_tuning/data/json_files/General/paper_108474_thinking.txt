To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semantically Proportional Patchmix for Few-Shot Learning" by Jingquan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset is described as a subset of ILSVRC-12, containing 100 distinct classes with 600 images each, resized to 84 × 84 pixels. The authors follow a specific split for training, validation, and evaluation.

2. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images from 200 bird classes, also resized to 84 × 84 pixels. The authors mention using a specific split for training, validation, and testing.

To ensure accuracy, I will check the **References section** for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Sachin Ravi and Hugo Larochelle. "Optimization as a model for few-shot learning." In ICLR. 2017, OpenReview.net.

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > P. Welinder, S. Branson, T. Mita, C. Wah, F. Schroff, S. Belongie, and P. Perona. "Caltech-UCSD Birds 200." Tech. Rep. CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have a clear and organized representation of the datasets used in the research.
