To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAMSON: Sharpness-Aware Minimization Scaled by Outlier Normalization for Improving DNN Generalization and Robustness" by GonÃ§alo Mordido et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on several architectures and datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for a subsection that explicitly discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** for their experiments. I will note down these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the training and evaluation processes for the models on these datasets. They mention that the models were trained for specific epochs and with certain configurations, but I need to ensure I capture the datasets' full citations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

Having gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
