To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Dialogue Management: Quality Datasets vs Models" by Miguel Ángel Medina-Ramírez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention studying errors in widely used datasets, specifically **Multiwoz 2.1** and **SGD**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their analysis. They mention:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This dataset is highlighted as a widely used multi-domain dialogue dataset, and the authors reference a specific paper for its details.
2. **SGD (Schema-Guided Dialogue)**: This dataset is also mentioned as a cleaner and more research-oriented dataset for agent generalization.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MultiWOZ 2.1**, the citation is:
  > Eric J. M. Mosig, Vladimir Vlasov, and Alan Nichol. *MultiWOZ 2.1: A consolidated multi-domain dialogue dataset with state corrections and state tracking baselines*. In Proceedings of the Twelfth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, pages 422–428, 2020.

- For **SGD**, the citation is:
  > Abhinav Rastogi, Xiaoxue Zang, Srinivas Sunkara, Raghav Gupta, and Pranav Khaitan. *Towards scalable multi-domain conversational agents: The schema-guided dialogue dataset*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 34, pages 8689–8696, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets discussed in the paper.
