To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Alternative Techniques for Improving Adversarial Robustness: Analysis of Adversarial Training at a Spectrum of Perturbations" by Kaustubh Sridhar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-10-C** datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

For the **CIFAR-10-C dataset**, the citation is:
> Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, used for training and evaluating machine learning models.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-10-C**: A dataset that consists of corrupted versions of the CIFAR-10 dataset, used to evaluate the robustness of models against common corruptions.
   - Citation: Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

With this information, I am ready to present the dataset details in the required format for further processing or review.
