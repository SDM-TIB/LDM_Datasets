To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Representation Decomposition for Image Manipulation and Beyond" by Shang-Fu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed dec-GAN on multiple image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is described as containing 60,000 training and 10,000 test digit images across 10 classes. This is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, particularly for digit recognition tasks.

2. **CMU Multi-PIE**: The authors specify that they used a subset of this dataset, which includes face images with variations in viewpoint, illumination, and expression. They mention that they only used images with 5 viewpoints and smiling expression variations, totaling 68,810 images.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 1998.

- For **CMU Multi-PIE**, the citation is:
  > Ralph Gross, Iain Matthews, Jeffrey Cohn, Takeo Kanade, and Simon Baker. "Multi-pie." *Image and Vision Computing*, vol. 28, no. 5, pp. 807–813, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
