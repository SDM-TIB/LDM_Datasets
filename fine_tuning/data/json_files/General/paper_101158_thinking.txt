To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Curiously Effective Features for Image Quality Prediction" by Sören Becker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of visual quality prediction models but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the importance of visual quality prediction, which may lead to dataset mentions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they mention using the **LIVE database** for training their support vector regression (SVR) model. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the results or analysis sections. In the results section, the authors evaluate their models on both the **TID2013** and **CSIQ** databases, which are also important datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets identified:

1. **LIVE Database**: This dataset is used for training the SVR model. It is a well-known dataset in the field of image quality assessment.
   
2. **TID2013 Database**: This dataset is used for cross-database evaluation, providing a diverse set of distortion types for testing the models.

3. **CSIQ Database**: Similar to TID2013, this dataset is also used for evaluating the performance of the models across different distortion types.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **LIVE Database**, the citation is:
  > H. R. Sheikh, M. F. Sabir, and A. C. Bovik. *A statistical evaluation of recent full reference image quality assessment algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 15, no. 11, pp. 3440–3451, 2006.

- For the **TID2013 Database**, the citation is:
  > N. Ponomarenko, L. Jin, O. Ieremeiev, V. Lukin, K. Egiazarian, J. Astola, B. Vozel, K. Chehdi, M. Carli, F. Battisti, and C.-C. J. Kuo. *Image database TID2013: Peculiarities, results and perspectives*. Signal Processing: Image Communication, vol. 30, pp. 57–77, 2015.

- For the **CSIQ Database**, the citation is:
  > E. C. Larson and D. M. Chandler. *Most apparent distortion: full-reference image quality assessment and the role of strategy*. Journal of Electronic Imaging, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 011006, 2010.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for each identified dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
