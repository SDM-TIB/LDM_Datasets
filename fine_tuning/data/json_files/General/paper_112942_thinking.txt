To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Diverse Vocal Bursts with StyleGAN2 and MEL-Spectrograms" by Marco Jiralerspong and Gauthier Gidel, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained a conditional StyleGAN2 architecture on mel-spectrograms of audio samples, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference a novel dataset of non-verbal vocal bursts from Cowen et al. (2022). This is a strong indication that I need to look for more details about this dataset.

Next, I will check the **method section**, particularly the audio preprocessing and mel-spectrogram conversion subsections, to see if there are any specific details about the dataset used. The authors mention that they processed audio samples from the dataset, but I need to find the exact name and citation of the dataset.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their model but do not introduce new datasets. However, they do mention that audio samples from the best conditional model checkpoint are made available, which may imply that the dataset is publicly accessible.

Now, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the **Hume Vocal Burst Competition Dataset (H-VB)**, the citation is:
  > Cowen, A., Bard, A., Tzirakis, P., Opara, M., Kim, L., Brooks, J., and Metrick, J. *The hume vocal burst competition dataset (H-VB) â€” raw data [exvo: updated 02.28.22] [data set]*. Zenodo, 2022. URL https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6308780.

This citation provides the necessary details about the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the dataset in any subsequent analysis or application.
