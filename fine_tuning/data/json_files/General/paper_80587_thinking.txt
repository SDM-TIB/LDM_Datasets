To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Rank Binary Codes" by Jie Feng, Wei Liu, and Yan Wang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of binary codes in various vision problems and mention that they will evaluate their method on several datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, containing 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples of 28x28 grayscale images.

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class, and each image is resized to 32x32 pixels.

3. **YouTube Faces Database**: A dataset containing 3,425 videos of 1,595 individuals, with each video averaging 181.3 frames, and faces in each frame are annotated with bounding boxes.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278â€“2324.

- For the **CIFAR10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Master Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

- For the **YouTube Faces Database**, the citation is:
  > Wolf, L., Hassner, T., & Maoz, I. (2011). Face recognition in unconstrained videos with matched background similarity. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
