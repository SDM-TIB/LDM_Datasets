To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chasing Day and Night: Towards Robust and Efficient All-Day Object Detection Guided by an Event Camera" by Jiahang Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose two new datasets, which is a strong indication that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section IV, where the authors discuss datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the creation of two synthetic event datasets based on popular benchmarks: **E-MSCOCO** and **E-VOC**. I will note the details provided about these datasets, including their purpose and how they were generated.

In addition, the authors mention the use of existing datasets, specifically **PASCAL VOC** and **MSCOCO**, for generating exposure datasets (EXPOSE-VOC and EXPOSE-COCO) through exposure transformation. This is important as it indicates the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **E-MSCOCO**: This dataset is based on the MSCOCO benchmark. The citation for MSCOCO is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

2. **E-VOC**: This dataset is based on the PASCAL VOC benchmark. The citation for PASCAL VOC is:
   > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 111, pages 98–136, 2015.

3. **EXPOSE-VOC** and **EXPOSE-COCO**: These datasets are derived from the original PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO datasets, respectively, but specific citations for these transformed datasets are not provided in the references. However, I will note that they are based on the aforementioned datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
