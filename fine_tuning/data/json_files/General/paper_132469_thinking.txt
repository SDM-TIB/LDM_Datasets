To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence guarantees for forward gradient descent in the linear regression model" by Thijs Bos and Johannes Schmidt-Hieber, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the theoretical analysis of a gradient-free method in the context of linear regression, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if present) to see if the authors provide any empirical results based on specific datasets. In this case, the paper does not seem to have a dedicated experiments section, but it does mention the use of data generated from a d-dimensional linear regression model with Gaussian random design in **section 3 (Convergence rates in the linear regression model)**. This indicates that the authors are likely using synthetic data for their analysis.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if the authors refer to any existing datasets used in their analysis. However, since the paper primarily focuses on theoretical guarantees and does not present empirical results based on real-world datasets, it appears that there are no specific datasets to extract.

Since the paper does not provide any named datasets or references to datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses a method and its theoretical implications, it does not utilize any specific datasets for empirical validation, and thus, there are no dataset citations to provide.
