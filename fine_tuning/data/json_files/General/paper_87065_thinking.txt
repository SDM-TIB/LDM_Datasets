To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized SGD with Asynchronous, Local, and Quantized Updates" by Giorgi Nadiradze et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed algorithm to "large-scale image classification and translation tasks," which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing over 14 million images across more than 20,000 categories.

3. **WMT17 Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for English-German translation, and is part of the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) series.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *The CIFAR-10 dataset*. Online: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kriz/cifar.html, 2014.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

- For **WMT17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn, Christof Monz, and others. *Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their authoritative references.
