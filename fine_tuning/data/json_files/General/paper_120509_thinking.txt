To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Galaxy Image Classification using Hierarchical Data Learning with Weighted Sampling and Label Smoothing" by Xiaohua Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data preparation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of data from "Galaxy Zoo-The Galaxy Challenge," which indicates that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**: This dataset is described as a redshift survey project that has produced various versions of photometric images and spectral data. The latest release mentioned is Data Release 17 (SDSS DR17).

2. **Galaxy Zoo**: This dataset is a citizen science project that includes a large number of galaxy images classified by volunteers. The authors specifically refer to the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset, which is derived from SDSS DR7 and contains 34,617,406 galaxy images.

3. **Galaxy Zoo-The Galaxy Challenge**: This dataset consists of 61,578 labeled galaxy images from SDSS DR7, which is used for training, validation, and testing in the experiments.

In the **dataset selection subsection**, the authors explain the clean sample selection process, resulting in a final dataset of 28,790 samples, which is further divided into training, validation, and test sets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets:

- For **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**, the citation is:
  > York D. G., et al. (2000). *AJ, 120, 1579*.

- For **Galaxy Zoo**, the citation is:
  > Raddick M. J., et al. (2010). *Astronomy Education Review, 9, 18*.

- For **Galaxy Zoo-The Galaxy Challenge**, the citation is:
  > Lintott C., et al. (2011). *MNRAS, 410, 166*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
