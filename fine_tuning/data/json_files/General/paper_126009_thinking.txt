To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Function Descent" by Felix Benning and Leif DÃ¶ring, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or benchmarks that the authors may have used to validate their proposed method. If the introduction mentions any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** to see if the authors describe the experimental setup in detail. This section often includes specific datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods. If datasets are mentioned, I will extract their names and any characteristics described, such as size, type, or source.

Following that, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their method on specific datasets. This may provide additional context or confirmation of the datasets used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title of the work, publication details, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately documented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and complete.
