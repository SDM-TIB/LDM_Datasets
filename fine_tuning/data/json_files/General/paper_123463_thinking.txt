To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactions between β-endorphin and kisspeptin neurons of the ewe arcuate nucleus are modulated by photoperiod" by Vincent Hellier et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aims and findings, which may include references to specific datasets or experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the experimental design, including any datasets used for analysis. In this paper, the authors describe their experimental procedures involving adult Ile-de-France ewes, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to animal treatments, hormonal measurements, or neuronal activity.

I will also examine the **results section** closely, as it typically presents the findings of the experiments, including any quantitative data that may be part of a dataset. For instance, the paper includes a table (Table 1) that quantitatively analyzes the effects of β-endorphin on kisspeptin neuronal activation, which is a crucial dataset for this study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies that are cited. This is important for ensuring that I can provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets related to:
1. The hormonal levels measured in the ewes (e.g., LH levels).
2. The immunocytochemistry results showing the interaction between β-endorphin and kisspeptin neurons.
3. Any quantitative data presented in tables or figures.

Once I have identified the datasets and their descriptions, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

1. For the hormonal measurements, I will cite the relevant studies or datasets that describe the methods used for measuring LH levels in ewes.
2. For the immunocytochemistry data, I will reference any foundational studies that describe the techniques or antibodies used in the experiments.
3. For the quantitative analysis presented in Table 1, I will ensure to cite the original sources of the methods or data used for comparison.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear and concise manner, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
