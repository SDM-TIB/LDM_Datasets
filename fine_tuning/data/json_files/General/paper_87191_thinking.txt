To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sobolev Independence Criterion" by Youssef Mroueh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for validation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly looking for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments validating the Sobolev Independence Criterion (SIC) on both synthetic and real-world datasets. 

In the **experiments section**, I will identify the datasets used:

1. **SinExp Dataset**: This is a synthetic dataset generated from a complex multivariate model where the output depends on a subset of features. The authors mention that it consists of 125 and 500 samples, generated according to a specific mathematical model.

2. **Liang Dataset**: This dataset is a variant of a synthetic dataset proposed in previous work, where the target variable depends on a subset of features. The authors provide details on how this dataset is constructed and its relevance to their experiments.

3. **Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) Dataset**: This real-world dataset contains information about anti-cancer drug responses in various cancer cell lines. The authors reference this dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in a practical application.

4. **HIV-1 Drug Resistance Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze mutations associated with drug resistance. The authors describe how they utilize this dataset in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SinExp Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jean Feng and Noah Simon. *Sparse-input neural networks for high-dimensional nonparametric regression and classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.07592, 2017.

- For the **Liang Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Faming Liang, Qizhai Li, and Lei Zhou. *Bayesian neural networks for selection of drug sensitive genes*. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 113(523), 2018.

- For the **CCLE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jordi Barretina, Giordano Caponigro, Nicolas Stransky, Kavitha Venkatesan, Adam A Margolin, et al. *The cancer cell line encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity*. Nature, 483(7391):603, 2012.

- For the **HIV-1 Drug Resistance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soo-Yon Rhee, Jonathan Taylor, Gauhar Wadhera, Asa Ben-Hur, Douglas L Brutlag, and Robert W Shafer. *Genotypic predictors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 drug resistance*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(46):17355â€“17360, 2006.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
