To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Adaptive Deep Network for Building Footprint Segmentation" by A. Ziaee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the need for accurate segmentation of building footprints from satellite images, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **methodology** section, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of the **Orthofoto Tirol dataset** for training their G2G network. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

In **section 3 (Experimental results)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Orthofoto Tirol dataset**, including its characteristics. They specify that the dataset consists of:
- **Satellite Images**: 21,076 images, each sized 4053 × 4053 pixels, in PNG format.
- **Ground Truths**: 21,076 images, also sized 4053 × 4053 pixels, in PNG format.

The authors also describe how they processed these images to create training, validation, and test datasets, which further confirms the importance of the Orthofoto Tirol dataset in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Orthofoto Tirol dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Orthofoto Tirol dataset. https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/35691b6c-9ed7-4517-b4b3-688b0569729a

Since this is a dataset from a government data portal, I will format the citation appropriately.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the Orthofoto Tirol dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be crucial for proper attribution and for anyone who wishes to access the dataset for their own research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format that captures all the necessary details, ready for review or further processing.
