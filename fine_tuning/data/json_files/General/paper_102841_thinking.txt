To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SOTR: Segmenting Objects with Transformers" by Ruohao Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method performs well on the **MS COCO dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention that they conduct experiments on the **MS COCO dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for instance segmentation tasks. 

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, M. Maire, Serge J. Belongie, James Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset used in this research is the **MS COCO dataset**.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and concise summary of the dataset used in the research paper.
