To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comparative Study of Training Objectives for Clarification Facet Generation" by Shiyu Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of an open-domain query facet dataset called **MIMICS**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that their experiments are based on the **MIMICS dataset**, which consists of search clarification datasets for real search queries sampled from Bing query logs. The section details that MIMICS contains three subsets: **MIMICS-Click**, **MIMICS-ClickExplore**, and **MIMICS-Manual**. The authors specify that they used **MIMICS-Click** for training and **MIMICS-Manual** for evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the MIMICS dataset is as follows:
- For **MIMICS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hamed Zamani, Gord Lueck, Everest Chen, Rodolfo Quispe, Flint Luu, and Nick Craswell. *MIMICS: A large-scale data collection for search clarification*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, pages 3189â€“3196, 2020.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose, structure, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
