To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?" by Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, and Dan Klein, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract introduces **CONFLICTINGQA**, a dataset created to study how language models handle conflicting evidence. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (The CONFLICTINGQA Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they outline the construction process, including the collection of contentious questions and the retrieval of evidence paragraphs that support both affirmative and negative answers. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset.

In this section, the authors mention that **CONFLICTINGQA** consists of:
- A set of **238 questions** across **144 categories**.
- A total of **2,208 retrieved paragraphs** with an average length of **365.01 words**.

The dataset is designed to evaluate how language models assess the convincingness of evidence in response to controversial questions. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since **CONFLICTINGQA** is a new dataset created by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. However, I will note that the dataset is introduced and described in their paper, which serves as the primary source.

The citation for the paper itself, which includes the dataset, is:
> Alexander Wan, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein. *What Evidence Do Language Models Find Convincing?* In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages XX-XX, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for **CONFLICTINGQA** with the relevant details, including its purpose, structure, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is formatted correctly and ready for any required output or further processing.
