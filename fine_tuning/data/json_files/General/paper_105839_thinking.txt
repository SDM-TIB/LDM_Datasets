To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demystifying Deep Learning Models for Retinal OCT Disease Classification using Explainable AI" by Tasnim Sakib Apon et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology for specific dataset details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of explainability in AI for healthcare, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methodology section** where they describe their proposed model and data gathering.

In **section III-B (Data Acquisition and Preparation)**, the authors state that they obtained a dataset containing **84,495 X-ray images** categorized into four classes: Normal, CNV (Choroidal Neovascularization), DME (Diabetic Macular Edema), and Drusen. This section provides crucial information about the dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **distribution of data** in **Table III**, which details the number of images available for each class, as well as how they are split into training, validation, and testing sets. This confirms the dataset's structure and the number of images per class.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to a dataset from Kermany et al. (2018) that is relevant to their study. The citation for this dataset is:

- Kermany, D. S., Goldbaum, M., Cai, W., Valentim, C. C., Liang, H., Baxter, S. L., et al. (2018). Identifying medical diagnoses and treatable diseases by image-based deep learning. *Cell*, 172(5), 1122-1131.e9. DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.010.

Since the authors do not provide a specific citation for their custom dataset, I will note that it is a self-developed dataset of OCT images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete for future reference or processing.
