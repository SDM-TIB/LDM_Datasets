To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-preserving Distributed Machine Learning via Local Randomization and ADMM Perturbation" by Xin Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting experiments using "real-world datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **Section VI (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention two types of datasets:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset contains census data of 48,842 individuals with 14 attributes, used for classifying income levels. The authors provide a brief description of the dataset and how it was preprocessed.

2. **Gunnar Ratsch’s Benchmark Datasets**: The authors mention using seven datasets from this collection, specifically highlighting datasets such as German, Image, Ringnorm, Banana, Splice, Twonorm, and Waveform. They provide details about the number of instances in each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI machine learning repository*. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

- For **Gunnar Ratsch’s Benchmark Datasets**, the citation is:
  > Cawley, G. C. (2017). *Gunnar Ratsch’s benchmark datasets*. Retrieved from http://theoval.cmp.uea.ac.uk/matlab/benchmarks

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
