To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling" by Liliang Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a wide range of tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their model on several benchmarks, including:

1. **Long Range Arena (LRA)**: This benchmark includes multiple tasks such as ListOps, text classification, document retrieval, image classification, and others. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset citation for LRA, as it is a benchmark rather than a single dataset.

2. **Speech Commands Dataset**: The authors mention using the SC10 subset of this dataset for speech classification tasks. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.

3. **enwik8**: This is mentioned as a language modeling benchmark. I will also need to find its citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **Speech Commands Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

- For **enwik8**, the citation is:
  > Marcus Hutter. *The human knowledge compression contest*. http://prize.hutter1.net/, 2006.

Since the Long Range Arena (LRA) is a benchmark that includes multiple tasks, it does not have a single citation but is referenced in the paper as a collection of tasks.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
