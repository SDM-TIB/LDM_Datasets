To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optuna: A Next-generation Hyperparameter Optimization Framework" by Takuya Akiba et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Optuna and its capabilities but does not specify any datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in experiments or evaluations. Here, the authors mention the need for efficient hyperparameter optimization but do not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experimental evaluation section**, I will look for any datasets that were utilized in the experiments. The authors mention using the **Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset** for evaluating the performance of their pruning system with the AlexNet architecture. This is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

I will also check the **real-world applications section**, where the authors describe various applications of Optuna. They mention using Optuna in the **Open Images Object Detection Track 2018**, which is another dataset relevant to their work. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SVHN Dataset**: The citation for the SVHN dataset is:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

2. **Open Images Dataset**: The citation for the Open Images dataset is:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper R. R. Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Tom Duerig, and Vittorio Ferrari. *The open images dataset V4: unified image classification, object detection, and visual relationship detection at scale*. CoRR, abs/1811.00982, 2018.

After compiling this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the paper.
