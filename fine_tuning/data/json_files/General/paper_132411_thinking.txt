To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaining Insights into Denoising by Inpainting" by Daniel Gaa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the denoising by inpainting framework and mentions various image analysis tasks, but it does not explicitly name any datasets. The introduction provides context about the research but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention evaluating their framework on three standard test images: **trui**, **peppers**, and **walter**. I will note these images as datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the images used, but I can infer that these images are commonly used benchmark images in the field of image processing and denoising.

1. **trui**: This is a standard test image often used in image processing literature, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.
2. **peppers**: This image is also a well-known test image in image processing. The citation is typically:
   > "Peppers" image from the USC-SIPI Image Database, available at: http://sipi.usc.edu/database/
3. **walter**: Similar to the previous images, this is another standard test image, but no specific citation is provided in the paper.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the images, I will note them as standard benchmark images commonly referenced in the literature.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names of the datasets and any relevant information about their usage in the experiments, along with the inferred citations where applicable.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and organized representation of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
