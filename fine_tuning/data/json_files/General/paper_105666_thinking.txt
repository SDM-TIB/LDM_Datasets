To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Critical Biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean for Climate Monitoring" by Ellen Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained neural networks on observations from the **Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP)**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their study.

Next, I will examine the **Methods section**, specifically the subsection titled **Dataset and training**. Here, the authors explicitly mention using **GO-SHIP data** for training their models, which includes 42,412 data points from Southern Ocean cruises between 2001-2019. This confirms that the GO-SHIP dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also reference the **Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Model 5 (IPSL-CM5)** in the context of model applications, indicating that they used this model's output data for comparison. This suggests that the IPSL-CM5 dataset is also relevant.

In the **References section**, I will locate the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **GO-SHIP dataset**, the citation is:
   > Carbon Hydrographic Data Office. GO-SHIP data. https://cchdo.ucsd.edu, 9 2021.

2. For the **IPSL-CM5 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Climate Modeling Center. Institut Pierre Simon Laplace Climate Model 5 (IPSL-CM5). https://cmc.ipsl.fr/international-projects/cmip5/, 9 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **Dataset 1**: GO-SHIP data, which includes oceanographic measurements from Southern Ocean cruises.
- **Dataset 2**: IPSL-CM5 model output data, used for comparison with the neural network predictions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
