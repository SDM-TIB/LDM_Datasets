To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Revisiting Weight Initialization of Deep Neural Networks" by Maciej Skorski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **Word2Vec** and the **MNIST/CIFAR image classification tasks**, indicating that these datasets are likely used.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 5) for detailed descriptions of the datasets. The authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9).

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper, but it seems that these two are the primary datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*.

Having gathered this information, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
