To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bounding Information Leakage in Machine Learning" by Ganesh Del Grosso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the potential of their approach using both synthetic data and classification tasks on natural images, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to "membership and attribute inference attacks" and mention the **PenDigits dataset** as a case study for recovering the identity of writers. This indicates that the PenDigits dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors explicitly mention the **PenDigits dataset** in the context of attribute inference attacks, providing details about its structure and the sensitive information it contains.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the PenDigits dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For the **PenDigits dataset**:
  > A. S. Lundervold, A. Lundervold. "An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI." *Zeitschrift f√ºr Medizinische Physik*, 127, 29-39, 2019. doi:10.1016/j.zemedi.2018.11.002.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the PenDigits dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
