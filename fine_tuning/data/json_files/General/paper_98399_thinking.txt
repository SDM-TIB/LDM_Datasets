To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General Instance Distillation for Object Detection" by Xing Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the method is verified on the **MSCOCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they conducted experiments on both the **MSCOCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets, confirming their use in the study. I will also check if there are any additional details provided about these datasets, such as their size, structure, or specific splits used in the experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For the **MSCOCO dataset**, the citation is:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 740–755, Cham, 2014. Springer International Publishing.

For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
> Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 6154–6162, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
