To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ontologia para monitorar a deficiência mental em seus déficits no processamento da informação por declínio cognitivo e evitar agressões psicológicas e físicas em ambientes educacionais com ajuda da I.A" by Bruna Araújo de Castro Oliveira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, background, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of artificial intelligence to detect verbal and physical aggression related to psychosocial disabilities, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the author mentions specific datasets or studies that provide data for their analysis. The introduction discusses the importance of identifying responsible parties and finding solutions for individuals with mental disabilities, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

In the **background section**, the author references studies and theories related to mental disabilities and their impact on communication and cognition. I will look for any specific datasets or sources of data that might be cited here.

Moving to the **methodology section**, I will examine how the author proposes to collect and analyze data. The paper outlines a model for audio capture in educational environments, which implies that there may be datasets generated from this audio analysis. However, I need to confirm if any specific datasets are mentioned.

Throughout the paper, I will also check the **references section** for any cited datasets or studies that could serve as datasets. The references include works by Foucault and Markov et al., but I need to determine if they provide datasets or if they are merely theoretical frameworks.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each dataset. For example, if the paper refers to a dataset used in a study, I will note the authors, title, publication details, and any relevant URLs.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. If no specific datasets are found, I will summarize the data collection methods proposed in the paper and note that no explicit datasets were cited.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I thoroughly extract and document any datasets referenced in the paper while maintaining the importance of full citations for each dataset.
