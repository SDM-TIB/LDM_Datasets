To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Smart Sampling: Self-Attention and Bootstrapping for Improved Ensembled Q-Learning" by Muhammad Junaid Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **method section** where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section may include specific datasets used for training or evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors typically discuss the environments or datasets on which they tested their method. In this paper, they mention evaluating their algorithm on four OpenAI Gym environments: **Ant-v2, Hopper-v2, Humanoid-v2, and Walker2d-v2**. This indicates that these environments serve as the datasets for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these environments. Since these environments are part of the OpenAI Gym, I will look for the original source or documentation that describes them. The OpenAI Gym is a well-known toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms, and it is likely that the authors will reference the original OpenAI Gym paper.

The citation for the OpenAI Gym is:
> Brockman, G., Cheung, V., Pettersson, L. H., Schneider, J., Schulman, J., Tang, J., & Zaremba, W. (2016). *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
