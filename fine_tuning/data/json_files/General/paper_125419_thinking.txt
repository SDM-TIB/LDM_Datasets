To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Always Strengthen Your Strengths: A Drift-Aware Incremental Learning Framework for CTR Prediction" by Congcong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction and mentions evaluations on both a real-world industrial dataset and a public dataset, indicating that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention:

1. **Industrial Dataset**: This dataset is constructed from user logs of real production systems, containing about 6 billion ad impression records sorted chronologically. This dataset is crucial for validating the proposed method in a real-world scenario.

2. **Public Dataset (Avazu)**: The authors refer to the Avazu dataset, which is reorganized chronologically for their experiments. This dataset is commonly used in CTR prediction research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Avazu dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction/data.

- The **industrial dataset** does not have a specific citation since it is derived from proprietary user logs, but I will note that it is based on real production data from JD.com.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Industrial Dataset**: Contains approximately 6 billion ad impression records from real production systems, used to validate the proposed method.
2. **Avazu Dataset**: A public dataset used for CTR prediction, reorganized chronologically for the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately represented for further processing or review.
