To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MATrIX - Modality-Aware Transformer for Information eXtraction" by Thomas Delteil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that MATrIX is evaluated on three different datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation setup. In **subsection 4.2 (Entity Extraction Tasks)**, they mention two datasets:

1. **CORD**: The COnsolidated Receipt Dataset for Post-OCR Parsing is described as containing 1,000 samples, with 800 for training, 100 for validation, and 100 for testing. It defines 30 classes grouped into 5 superclasses.

2. **FUNSD**: The Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents dataset consists of 199 samples, with 149 used for training and the remaining 50 for evaluation. The authors report an F1-score for this dataset.

In **subsection 4.3 (Document Classification Task)**, the authors mention another dataset:

3. **RVL-CDIP**: This dataset contains 400,000 images split across 16 classes, with 320,000 samples used for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **CORD**, the citation is:
  > Seunghyun Park, Seung Shin, Bado Lee, Junyeop Lee, Jaeheung Surh, Minjoon Seo, and Hwalsuk Lee. *CORD: A Consolidated Receipt Dataset for Post-OCR Parsing*. 2019.

- For **FUNSD**, the citation is:
  > Guillaume Jaume, Hazim Kemal Ekenel, and Jean-Philippe Thiran. *FUNSD: A Dataset for Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents*. In Accepted to ICDAR-OST, 2019.

- For **RVL-CDIP**, the citation is:
  > Adam W Harley, Alex Ufkes, and Konstantinos G Derpanis. *Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Nets for In-Document Image Classification and Retrieval*. In International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2019.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or processing.
