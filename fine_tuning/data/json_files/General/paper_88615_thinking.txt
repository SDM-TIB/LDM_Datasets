To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Good Feature Matching: Towards Accurate, Robust VO/VSLAM with Low Latency" by Yipu Zhao and Patricio A. Vela, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In the **results section**, I will verify if the authors discuss the performance of their method on these datasets, which can provide additional context about the datasets' significance in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. This is crucial as it allows me to provide accurate and complete references for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For this specific paper, I will look for datasets such as:

1. **EuRoC MAV Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating the proposed method. I will note its characteristics, such as the number of sequences and the environments in which they were recorded.

2. **TUM-VI Dataset**: This dataset is also referenced for evaluation purposes. I will extract details about the sequences used and any specific conditions under which the data was collected.

3. **TUM-RGBD Dataset**: I will check if this dataset is mentioned and gather relevant details, including the number of sequences and their characteristics.

4. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used in visual odometry and SLAM research. I will look for specific sequences referenced in the paper and any relevant metrics reported.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about each dataset, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **EuRoC MAV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Burri, J. Nikolic, P. Gohl, T. Schneider, J. Rehder, S. Omari, M. W. Achtelik, and R. Siegwart. "The EuRoC micro aerial vehicle datasets." *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 35, no. 10, pp. 1157–1163, 2016.

- For **TUM-VI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Schubert, T. Goll, N. Demmel, V. Usenko, J. Stueckler, and D. Cremers. "The TUM VI benchmark for evaluating visual-inertial odometry." In *IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems*, 2018.

- For **TUM-RGBD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Sturm, W. Burgard, and D. Cremers. "Evaluating egomotion and structure-from-motion approaches using the TUM RGB-D benchmark." In *Workshop on Color-Depth Camera Fusion in Robotics at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems*, 2012.

- For **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Geiger, P. Lenz, C. Stiller, and R. Urtasun. "Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset." *The International Journal of Robotics Research*, vol. 32, no. 11, pp. 1231–1237, 2013.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its relevance to the research presented in the paper. This will allow me to create a comprehensive summary of the datasets used in the study.
