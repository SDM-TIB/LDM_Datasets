To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning in Precision Medicine to Preserve Privacy via Encryption" by William Briguglio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a comprehensive genomics dataset for their machine learning model, which suggests that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. In this section, they specifically mention the **MSK-IMPACT dataset** as a case study for their machine learning framework. I will look for detailed descriptions of this dataset, including its contents, size, and any relevant features.

The authors provide a thorough description of the **MSK-IMPACT dataset**, noting that it comprises genomic patient records extracted from tumor-tissue samples taken from 10,336 patients. They mention that the dataset includes over 100,000 discovered mutations and various information about somatic mutations, which is crucial for understanding its application in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSK-IMPACT dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Zehir, A., Benayed, R., Shah, R.H., Syed, A., Middha, S., Kim, H.R., Srinivasan, P., Gao, J., Chakravarty, D., Devlin, S.M., et al. (2017). *Mutational landscape of metastatic cancer revealed from prospective clinical sequencing of 10,000 patients*. Nature Medicine, 23, 703.

Since the authors also reference the Oncology Knowledge Base in relation to the dataset, I will include that citation as well:
> Chakravarty, D., Gao, J., Phillips, S., Kundra, R., Zhang, H., Wang, J., Rudolph, J.E., Yaeger, R., Soumerai, T., Nissan, M.H., Chang, M.T., Chandarlapaty, S., Traina, T.A., Paik, P.K., Ho, A.L., Hantash, F.M., Grupe, A., Baxi, S.S., Callahan, M.K., Snyder, A., Chi, P., Danila, D.C., Gounder, M., Harding, J.J., Hellmann, M.D., Iyer, G., Janjigian, Y.Y., Kaley, T., Levine, D.A., Lowery, M., Omuro, A., Postow, M.A., Rathkopf, D., Shoushtari, A.N., Shukla, N., Voss, M.H., Paraiso, E., Zehir, A., Berger, M.F., Taylor, B.S., Saltz, L.B., Riely, G.J., Ladanyi, M., Hyman, D.M., Baselga, J., Sabbatini, P., Solit, D.B., Schultz, N. (2017). *Oncokb: A precision oncology knowledge base*. JCO Precision Oncology, 1-16.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and citations clearly to ensure that they are ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis. This process will help maintain the integrity of the data extraction and ensure that all relevant citations are accurately represented.
