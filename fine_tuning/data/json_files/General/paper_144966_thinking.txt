To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations" by Teun van der Weij et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating sandbagging capabilities in language models, which suggests that datasets are involved, particularly in the context of capability evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically looking for any subsections that detail the datasets used for experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several benchmarks, including:

1. **WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy)**: This benchmark is used to assess hazardous knowledge in biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity. The paper states that it contains questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge.

2. **MMLU (Massive Multi-Task Language Understanding)**: This benchmark tests knowledge across various topics and is mentioned as a general capability evaluation.

3. **CSQA (CommonsenseQA)**: This dataset is used to measure common-sense reasoning abilities.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WMDP**, the citation is:
  > Li, N., Pan, A., Gopal, A., Yue, S., Berrios, D., Gatti, A., Li, J. D., Dombrowski, A.-K., Goel, S., Phan, L., et al. (2024). *The WMDP benchmark: Measuring and reducing malicious use with unlearning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03218.

- For **MMLU**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., and Steinhardt, J. (2020). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300.

- For **CSQA**, the citation is:
  > Talmor, A., Herzig, J., Lourie, N., and Berant, J. (2018). *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00937.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for any further processing or review.
