To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PaCa-ViT: Learning Patch-to-Cluster Attention in Vision Transformers" by Ryan Grainger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods are tested on **ImageNet-1k**, **MS-COCO**, and **MIT-ADE20k** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4 (Experiments), the authors detail their evaluations on the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks and consists of approximately 1.28 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, covering 1,000 classes.

2. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is utilized for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. It includes a training set of 118,000 images and a validation set of 5,000 images.

3. **MIT-ADE20k**: This dataset is employed for semantic segmentation tasks and contains 150 ground-truth classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1k**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

- For **MIT-ADE20k**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Tete Xiao, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through the ADE20k dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(3):302–321, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the experiments conducted.
