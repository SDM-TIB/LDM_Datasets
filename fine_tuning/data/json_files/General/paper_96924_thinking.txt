To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Context Networks" by Yue Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For example, if the authors mention using datasets like COCO, ImageNet, or Kinetics, I will note these down.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **COCO Dataset**: Used for object detection and instance segmentation. The paper states that the COCO dataset consists of 118k training images, 5k validation images, and 20k test-dev images.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification tasks and contains 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes.

3. **Kinetics Dataset**: Utilized for action recognition, this dataset includes approximately 240,000 training videos and 20,000 validation videos across 400 human action categories.

4. **Cityscapes Dataset**: Mentioned for semantic segmentation tasks, this dataset consists of 5,000 finely annotated images and 20,000 coarsely annotated images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **COCO Dataset**:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. DollÃ¡r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009.

- For **Kinetics Dataset**:
  > W. Kay, J. Carreira, K. Simonyan, B. Zhang, C. Hillier, S. Vijayanarasimhan, F. Viola, T. Green, T. Back, P. Natsev et al. *The Kinetics Human Action Video Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For **Cityscapes Dataset**:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2016.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that the extracted datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference.
