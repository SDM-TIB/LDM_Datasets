To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Question Generation for Personalized Feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems" by Devang Kulshreshtha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on generating personalized feedback, which may hint at the datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors discuss the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and the need for personalized feedback, which may lead to mentions of specific datasets used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the subsection titled **3.2.1 (Dataset creation)**, the authors describe how they created a dataset by sampling cause-effect exercises and obtaining reference solutions from domain experts. This section is crucial as it provides details about the dataset used for training their Question Generation (QG) model.

The authors mention that they created a dataset by randomly sampling around **112 cause-effect exercises**, resulting in approximately **300 reference solutions**. They also note that four domain experts were involved in writing questions based on these reference solutions, which is an important detail for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not seem to reference any external datasets explicitly, but it does mention the creation of a new dataset for their specific study.

Since the authors created their own dataset, I will document it as follows:

1. **Korbit Dataset**: This dataset consists of **112 cause-effect exercises** and **300 reference solutions** created for the purpose of training the QG model. The dataset is unique to this study and is not publicly available as a separate entity.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is the source of the dataset information.

The citation for the paper is:
> Devang Kulshreshtha, Muhammad Shayan, Robert Belfer, Siva Reddy, Iulian Vlad Serban, Ekaterina Kochmar. *Few-shot Question Generation for Personalized Feedback in Intelligent Tutoring Systems*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, 2022.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
