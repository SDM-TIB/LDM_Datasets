To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Similarity Transfer for Knowledge Distillation" by Haoran Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on several public classification datasets, specifically **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CINIC-10, and Tiny-ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) to gather more detailed descriptions of these datasets. The authors provide specific information about each dataset used in their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes. It is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it includes 100 classes, making it more challenging.

3. **CINIC-10**: This dataset is a combination of CIFAR-10 and ImageNet images, totaling 270,000 images at a spatial resolution of 32 × 32. It is designed to provide a more diverse set of images for training.

4. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, Tiny-ImageNet contains 100,000 training images with a resolution of 64 × 64 across 200 categories, along with 10,000 additional test images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech. Rep., 2009.

- For **CINIC-10**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. Stanford Class CS 231N, 2015.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. Stanford Class CS 231N, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted information effectively for further use or analysis.
