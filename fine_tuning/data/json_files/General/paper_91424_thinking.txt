To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparative Analysis of Text Classification Approaches in Electronic Health Records" by Aurelie Mascio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials & methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves text classification tasks derived from electronic health records, which suggests that datasets will be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference several tasks related to electronic health records, hinting at the use of specific datasets. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of dataset names and their descriptions.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials & Methods)**, particularly subsection 2.1, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their analysis:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is described as an openly available dataset developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology, comprising clinical notes, demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, and other data associated with 40,000 critical care patients.

2. **ShARe/CLEF Dataset**: This dataset is based on clinical records from the MIMIC-II database and contains annotations for disorder mention spans with contextual attributes. It was generated as part of the Shared Annotated Resources (ShARe) project.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how they prepared and annotated the datasets for their specific text classification tasks, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Liwei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

- For the **ShARe/CLEF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Danielle L. Mowery, Sumithra Velupillai, Brett R. South, Lee Christensen, David Martinez, Liadh Kelly, Lorraine Goeuriot, Noemie Elhadad, Guergana Savova, and Wendy W. Chapman. *Task 2: ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2014*. page 12, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
