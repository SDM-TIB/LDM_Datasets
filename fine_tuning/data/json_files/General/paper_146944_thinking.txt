To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Framework of FAS-RIS Systems: Performance Analysis and Throughput Optimization" by Junteng Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (which is often where datasets are detailed) to find explicit mentions of datasets. I will look for any tables, figures, or descriptions that outline the datasets used in the study. 

In this paper, the authors discuss various scenarios involving Fluid Antenna Systems (FAS) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), but they do not explicitly mention any datasets in the provided text. Therefore, I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through referenced works.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used. 

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the references section. If the datasets are derived from other studies, I will ensure to cite the original sources accurately.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this particular paper. However, if there were datasets, I would format the information accordingly, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset as required.
