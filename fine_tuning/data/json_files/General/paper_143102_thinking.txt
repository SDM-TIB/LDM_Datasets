To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When Foresight Pruning Meets Zeroth-Order Optimization: Efficient Federated Learning for Low-Memory Devices" by Pengyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning on low-memory devices, which may hint at the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating their methods on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. I will note the details provided about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** for any additional datasets that might be referenced or used in prior studies that the authors build upon.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, I will look for the original papers that introduced these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master's thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

Both datasets are part of the same thesis, so they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
