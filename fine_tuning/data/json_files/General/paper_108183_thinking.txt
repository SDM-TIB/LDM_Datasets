To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Dialogue State Tracking with Weak Supervision and Sparse Data" by Michael Heck et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model's performance on a range of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further discusses the challenges of dialogue state tracking (DST) and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**. They state that they use the following datasets for their experiments:

1. **MultiWOZ 2.1**: This is described as a standard benchmark for multi-domain dialogue modeling, containing over 10,000 dialogues across five domains (train, restaurant, hotel, taxi, attraction) and 30 unique domain-slot pairs.

2. **WOZ 2.0**: This dataset is mentioned as a smaller dataset compared to MultiWOZ, which may lead to issues with sample sparsity.

3. **sim-M and sim-R**: These datasets are also referenced, indicating they are used for robustness tests.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their model on these datasets, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

- For **MultiWOZ 2.1**, the citation is:

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation for future reference or processing.
