To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transparent and Clinically Interpretable AI for Lung Cancer Detection in Chest X-Rays" by Amy Rafferty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "large public dataset of chest X-rays and associated medical reports," which suggests that a specific dataset is being referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they explicitly mention the **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**, which is a large public dataset containing chest X-rays and associated radiology reports. The authors provide specific details about the dataset, including the number of images (227,827) and the pathology labels (14 automatically assigned labels).

I will also note that the authors mention they selected a balanced subset of this dataset for their experiments, consisting of 2,374 scans (1,187 cancerous and 1,187 healthy). This is important for understanding the context in which the dataset was used.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-CXR Dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **MIMIC-CXR Dataset**:
  > Johnson, A., Lungren, M., Peng, Y., Lu, Z., Mark, R., Berkowitz, S., Horng, S.: MIMIC-CXR-JPG - Chest Radiographs with Structured Labels (version 2.0.0) (2019).

Additionally, I will ensure to note that the authors also reference the **CheXpert labelling tool**, which is used for pathology labels, but since it is not a dataset in itself, I will not include it in the dataset extraction.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the MIMIC-CXR Dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
