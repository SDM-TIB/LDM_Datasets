To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weak Collocation Regression method: fast reveal hidden stochastic dynamics from high-dimensional aggregate data" by Liwei Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets that are relevant to their work. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology section**, the authors typically describe the experimental setup in detail, including any datasets used. I will pay close attention to any subsections that specifically mention datasets, as they may provide crucial details about the datasets' characteristics, such as size, type, and source.

The **experiments section** is also critical, as it usually outlines the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any descriptions that clarify how the datasets were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the authors and title of the original dataset paper if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner, ready for further processing or review.
