To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models for Code Optimization" by Shukai Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach using the **PIE dataset**, which is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized. I will note this down as it is crucial for my extraction.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly state that they use the **PIE dataset** for fine-tuning and evaluation. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including its composition and purpose.

The authors describe the PIE dataset as consisting of approximately 40k Python files, 88k C++ files, and 3.6k Java files, capturing the progressive changes made by programmers to improve code performance. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PIE dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **PIE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Madaan, A., Shypula, A., Alon, U., Hashemi, M., Ranganathan, P., Yang, Y., Neubig, G., & Yazdanbakhsh, A. (2023). *Learning performance-improving code edits*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.07867.

Since the PIE dataset is a subset of the CodeNet collection, I will also look for the citation for the CodeNet dataset, which is referenced in the paper:

- For the **CodeNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Puri, R., Kung, D., Janssen, G., Zhang, W., Domeniconi, G., Zolotov, V., Dolby, J., Chen, J., Choudhury, M., Decker, L., Thost, V., Buratti, L., Pujar, S., Ramji, S., Finkler, U., Malaika, S., & Reiss, F. (2021). *CodeNet: A large-scale AI for code dataset for learning a diversity of coding tasks*. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help me accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
