To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dawn of Justice for Semantic Change Detection" by Francesco Periti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two benchmarks: **TempoWiC** and **HistoWiC**. This suggests that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe **TempoWiC** as an evaluation benchmark designed to detect short-term semantic changes using tweets from different time periods. They mention that it includes trial, training, and test sets with specific counts of positive and negative examples.

For **HistoWiC**, the authors explain that it is a novel benchmark for detecting long-term semantic changes in historical text, using sentences from English corpora related to the LSC detection task. They also provide details about the annotation process and the number of instances used for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **TempoWiC**:
   - Citation:

White, Gabriel Wong, Luis Espinosa-Anke, Leonardo Neves, Francesco Barbieri, and Jose Camacho-Collados. *TempoWiC: An Evaluation Benchmark for Detecting Meaning Shift in Social Media*. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 3353–3359, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea, 2022.

2. **HistoWiC**:
   - Citation:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
