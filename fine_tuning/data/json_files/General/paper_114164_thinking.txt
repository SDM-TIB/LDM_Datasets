To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-Aware Autoencoder Design for Real-Time Mixture-of-Experts Image Compression" by Elvira Fleig et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and previous works, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Steered Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) approach and its applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments or evaluation section** of the paper, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using the **mobile subset of the clic dataset** for training their networks. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the clic dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and understanding the dataset's context. 

The citation for the clic dataset is:
> G. Toderici, W. Shi, R. Timofte, L. Theis, J. Balle, E. Agustsson, N. Johnston, and F. Mentzer. *Workshop and challenge on learned image compression (clic2020)*, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The paper indicates that the mobile subset of the clic dataset was used for training, which involved over four million individual blocks extracted from greyscale images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
