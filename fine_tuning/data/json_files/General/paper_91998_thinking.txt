To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Few-Sample BERT Fine-Tuning" by Tianyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on fine-tuning BERT and hints at the use of multiple datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Methodology)**, where the authors describe their data setup. They mention using **eight datasets from the GLUE benchmark** for their experiments, which is a clear indication that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names and details of these datasets.

In **Appendix A**, the authors provide a summary of the datasets used, including their statistics and evaluation metrics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A binary classification task with 2,500 training samples, evaluated using accuracy.
   - Citation: Bentivogli et al. (2009). "The fifth pascal recognizing textual entailment challenge." In TAC 2009 Workshop.

2. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A binary classification task with 3,700 training samples, evaluated using F1 score.
   - Citation: Dolan & Brockett (2005). "Automatically constructing a corpus of sentential paraphrases." In IWP.

3. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: A regression task with 5,800 training samples, evaluated using Spearman Correlation Coefficient (SCC).
   - Citation: Cer et al. (2017). "Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity multilingual and crosslingual focused evaluation." In SemEval-2017.

4. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: A binary classification task with 8,600 training samples, evaluated using Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).
   - Citation: Warstadt et al. (2019). "Neural network acceptability judgments." TACL.

5. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A textual entailment dataset with 61,300 training samples, evaluated using accuracy.
   - Citation: Williams et al. (2018). "A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference." In ACL.

6. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A binary classification task with 104,000 training samples, evaluated using accuracy.
   - Citation: Iyer et al. (2017). "First quora dataset release: Question pairs." https://tinyurl.com/y2y8u5ed.

7. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A binary classification task with 392,000 training samples, evaluated using accuracy.
   - Citation: Socher et al. (2013). "Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank." In EMNLP.

8. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A textual entailment dataset with 104,000 training samples, evaluated using accuracy.
   - Citation: Wang et al. (2019). "GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding." In ICLR.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they will be crucial for any further analysis or referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for any downstream processing or review.
