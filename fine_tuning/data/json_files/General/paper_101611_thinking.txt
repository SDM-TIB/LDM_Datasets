To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Factors affecting the COVID-19 risk in the US counties: an innovative approach by combining unsupervised and supervised learning" by Samira Ziyadidegan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and data preparation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on analyzing factors affecting COVID-19 risk at the county level, which suggests that various datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data Preparation)**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the data was sourced from various online repositories from March 2020 to December 2020, which indicates multiple datasets are being utilized.

In this section, the authors specifically list the types of data they collected, including:

1. **COVID-19 Data**: This includes positive cases and death rates for each US county.
2. **Demographic Data**: Information such as population density, percentage of elderly people, and percentage of non-white people.
3. **Meteorological Data**: Climate data categorized by the Building America (BA) climatic regions.
4. **Health Data**: Metrics like the number of ICU beds per 10,000 people and the percentage of smokers.

The authors also provide links to the sources of these datasets in the **Data Availability Statement** section, which is crucial for citation purposes.

Now, I will extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **COVID Data**: 
   > The New York Times. 2021. “Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States.” https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.

2. **Health Data**: 
   > Opendata.dc.gov. “Adult ICU Beds.” https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/1044bb19da8d4dbfb6a96eb1b4ebf629_0?selectedAttribute=ADULT_ICU_BEDS.

3. **Demographic, Meteorological, and Location-based Data**: 
   > Kaggle. “US Counties COVID-19 Weather Sociohealth Data.” https://www.kaggle.com/johnjdavisiv/us-counties-covid19-weather-sociohealth-data.

4. **Census Data**: 
   > United States Census Bureau. 2020. “Population and Housing Unit Estimates.” https://www.census.gov.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
