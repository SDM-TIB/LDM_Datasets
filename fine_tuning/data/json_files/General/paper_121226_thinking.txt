To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Fully Automated and Scalable Surface Water Mapping with Topographic Airborne LiDAR Data" by Hunsoo Song and Jinha Jung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of airborne LiDAR data for mapping surface water, which suggests that datasets related to LiDAR and water mapping may be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and experimental design)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention that five different large-scale datasets were employed, which include various geographic locations and types of water bodies.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Denver Dataset**: A 25-km by 25-km area in Denver, CO, characterized as a mountainous area. The LiDAR data was acquired using the Leica TerrainMapper with a point density of 3.0 points/m².

2. **Wind River Dataset**: A 13-km by 13-km area in Wind River, WY, also a mountainous area, with LiDAR data acquired using the same Leica TerrainMapper at a point density of 2.0 points/m².

3. **Dallas Dataset**: A 35-km by 35-km metropolitan area in Dallas, TX, with LiDAR data from the Leica ALS 80 at a point density of 2.4 points/m².

4. **Orlando Dataset**: A 20-km by 20-km metropolitan area in Orlando, FL, with LiDAR data from the Leica ALS 80 at a point density of 9.8 points/m².

5. **Hollywood Dataset**: A 25-km by 2.5-km coastal area in Hollywood, FL, with LiDAR data from the Riegl VG-1560i at a point density of 8.2 points/m².

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper references the USGS’s 3D Elevation Program (3DEP) for the LiDAR data, which is a key source for the datasets used.

The full citation for the datasets is as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
