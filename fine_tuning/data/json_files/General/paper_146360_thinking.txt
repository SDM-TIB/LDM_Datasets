To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-modal Masked Siamese Network Improves Chest X-Ray Representation Learning" by Saeed Shurrab et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three publicly available chest X-ray datasets: **MIMIC-CXR**, **CheXpert**, and **NIH-14**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used. In this paper, the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) provides detailed information about the datasets. 

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MIMIC-CXR**: This dataset is a publicly available collection of chest radiographs, consisting of 377,110 images collected from 227,835 studies between 2011 and 2016. Each image is associated with ground-truth labels indicating the presence of various medical conditions.

2. **CheXpert**: This dataset contains 224,316 chest radiographs collected from 65,240 patients between 2002 and 2017. It includes images and associated radiology reports used to generate labels for 14 diseases.

3. **NIH-14**: This dataset comprises 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images of 30,805 patients, collected between 1992 and 2015. Each image is assigned 14 common disease labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Nathaniel R Greenbaum, Matthew P Lungren, Chihying Deng, Yifan Peng, Zhiyong Lu, Roger G Mark, Seth J Berkowitz, and Steven Horng. *MIMIC-CXR-JPG, a large publicly available database of labeled chest radiographs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.07042, 2019.

- For **CheXpert**, the citation is:
  > Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, Michael Ko, Yifan Yu, Silviana Ciurea-Ilcus, Chris Chute, Henrik Marklund, Behzad Haghgoo, Robyn Ball, Katie Shpanskaya, et al. *CheXpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, volume 33, pages 590–597, 2019.

- For **NIH-14**, the citation is:
  > Xiaosong Wang, Yifan Peng, Le Lu, Zhiyong Lu, Mohammadhadi Bagheri, and Ronald M Summers. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 2097–2106, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
