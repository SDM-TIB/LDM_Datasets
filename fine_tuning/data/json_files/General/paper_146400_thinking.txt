To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSMix: Distortion-Induced Sensitivity Map Based Pre-training for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment" by Jinsong Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple IQA datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Criteria)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention seven publicly available IQA datasets:

1. **LIVE Dataset**: Contains 799 images with five types of distortions, each corresponding to five levels of distortion.
2. **CSIQ Dataset**: Comprises 866 images and assesses six types of distortions based on 30 reference images.
3. **TID2013 Dataset**: Consists of 3000 images with 24 types of distortions.
4. **KADID Dataset**: The largest annotated synthetic distortion dataset, containing 10,125 images, including 81 reference images and 25 distortion levels.
5. **KADIS Dataset**: A synthesized dataset with 700,000 distorted images created from 140,000 reference images, incorporating 25 diverse types of distortions.
6. **CLIVE Dataset**: Contains 1162 authentic images with various distortions captured by mobile devices.
7. **KonIQ Dataset**: Includes 10,073 images selected from the YFCC-100M dataset.

In this section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes the size, type of distortion, and the range of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) or Differential Mean Opinion Scores (DMOS) for each dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented with their respective citations.
