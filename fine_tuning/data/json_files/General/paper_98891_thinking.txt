To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Approximate Spectral Normalization for Robust Deep Neural Networks" by Zhixin Pan and Prabhat Mishra, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the experiments.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, as this section usually contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSB)**: This dataset is described as containing more than 50,000 traffic sign image samples across 43 classes. It is used to evaluate the performance of the VGG16 classifier.

2. **Udacity Self-Driving (USD)**: This dataset consists of over 5,000 real-time screenshots from autonomous vehicles, with labels indicating the corresponding steering predictions (Left, Right, Center). It is used to evaluate the Lenet-5 network.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **German Traffic Sign Benchmark (GTSB)**, the citation is:
> [GTSB Dataset Reference] (Note: The actual reference is not provided in the text, so I will need to look it up separately to ensure accuracy.)

For the **Udacity Self-Driving (USD)** dataset, the citation is:
> [USD Dataset Reference] (Note: Similar to GTSB, I will need to find the actual reference for this dataset.)

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper citations for each.
