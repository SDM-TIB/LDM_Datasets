To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Multitask Learning Approach for BERT" by C¸ a˘gla Aksoy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but the **experiments section** is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments. They state that they tested different proposed architectures on several datasets, specifically for two downstream tasks: question answering and textual entailment. 

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **SQuAD1.1**: This dataset is used for question answering and is referenced as a significant benchmark in the field.
2. **SQuAD2.0**: An extension of SQuAD1.1, this dataset includes questions that do not have a possible answer in the given context, making it more challenging.
3. **WikiText-2**: This dataset is used for pre-training and is a collection of Wikipedia articles, which provides a rich source of text data.
4. **Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)**: This dataset is used for textual entailment tasks and consists of independent sentences.

Next, I will look in the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD1.1**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.05250, 2016.

- For **SQuAD2.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know What You Don’t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03822, 2018.

- For **WikiText-2**, the citation is:
  > Stephen Merity, Nitish Srivastava, Geoffrey J. Gordon, and James Bradbury. *Regularizing and Optimizing LSTM Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.00183, 2017.

- For **MultiNLI**, the citation is:
  > Adina Williams, Nikita Nangia, and Samuel R Bowman. *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05426, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
