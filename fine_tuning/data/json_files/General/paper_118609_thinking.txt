To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Convergent ADMM Framework for Efficient Neural Network Training" by Junxiang Wang, Hongyi Li, and Liang Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on **seven benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors describe their evaluation on various datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
2. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset consisting of fashion items, used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.
3. **Cora**: A dataset of scientific publications classified into categories.
4. **PubMed**: A dataset containing biomedical literature citations.
5. **Citeseer**: A dataset for identifying spam users based on relational features.
6. **Coauthor CS**: A co-authorship graph dataset.
7. **Coauthor Physics**: Another co-authorship graph dataset.

I will then gather detailed descriptions of each dataset, including the number of classes, features, and any relevant statistics provided in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
