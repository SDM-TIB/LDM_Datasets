To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Contextual Language Representation of Radiology Reports to Improve the Identification of Communication Urgency" by Xing Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a self-supervised model trained on radiology reports, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of obtaining large amounts of annotated training data in the biomedical domain, indicating the importance of datasets for their research.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. They mention two primary sources:

1. **RadCore Dataset**: This dataset contains about 2 million deidentified radiology reports aggregated from three major healthcare organizations. It is used for pre-training the BERT model.

2. **DHMC Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,124 radiology reports extracted from Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, with a balanced selection of reports requiring prompt communication and those that do not.

The authors also provide details about the manual annotation of the DHMC dataset, which establishes ground truth labels for the reports.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For the **RadCore Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hassanpour S, Langlotz CP. Information extraction from multi-institutional radiology reports. *Artificial Intelligence in Medicine*. 2016;66:29â€“39.

- For the **DHMC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Meng X, Ganoe CH, Sieberg RT, Cheung YY, Hassanpour S. Assisting radiologists with reporting urgent findings to referring physicians: a machine learning approach to identify cases for prompt communication. *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*. 2019;93:103169.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its source and citation for clarity and proper referencing.
