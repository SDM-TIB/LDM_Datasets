To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Progressive-Hint Prompting Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Chuanyang Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **seven benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **AddSub**: A dataset for arithmetic word problems.
2. **MultiArith**: A dataset for multi-step arithmetic problems.
3. **SingleEQ**: A dataset for single-equation problems.
4. **SVAMP**: A dataset for solving math word problems.
5. **GSM8K**: A dataset for grade school math problems.
6. **AQuA**: A dataset for algebraic word problems.
7. **MATH**: A dataset for mathematical reasoning tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are commonly known in the field, I will provide the citations based on their typical references:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented along with its citation.
