To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sifting out the features by pruning: Are convolutional networks the winning lottery ticket of fully connected ones?" by Franco Pellegrini and Giulio Biroli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses pruning methods and their application to neural networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Method, observables and notation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using a dataset referred to as **ImageNet32**, which consists of approximately 1.3 million images classified into 1000 categories from the ILSVRC-12 image classification challenge. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Additionally, the authors mention that they are using a low-resolution version of ImageNet, which is also referred to as **ImageNet32**. This is important to note as it specifies the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for **ImageNet32**, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future use or analysis.
