To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Pricing with Volume Discounts in Online Settings" by Marco Mussi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses a real-world A/B testing experiment conducted in collaboration with an Italian e-commerce company, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to transaction data.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**, where the authors detail the A/B testing experiment. They mention that the algorithm was tested on a set of approximately 295 products and a control set of 33 products. This indicates that there are datasets related to these products and their transaction data.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets or data sources. The authors describe the data collected during the experiment, which includes features such as the product identifier, number of units sold, price, cost, and customer class (business or private). This information suggests that there is a dataset containing transaction records for these products.

Now, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets used in the study. However, the paper does not seem to reference any external datasets; instead, it relies on the transaction data collected from the e-commerce company.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Transaction Data from E-commerce Company**: This dataset includes transaction records for approximately 295 products and 33 control products, containing features such as product identifiers, units sold, prices, costs, and customer classifications. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed pricing algorithm.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset (as it is proprietary data from the collaborating e-commerce company), I will note that it is an internal dataset without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference. The key points to remember are the nature of the dataset (transaction data) and the context in which it was used (A/B testing for pricing optimization).
