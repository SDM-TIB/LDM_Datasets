To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SCD: A Stacked Carton Dataset for Detection and Segmentation" by Jinrong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a large-scale dataset called the **Stacked Carton Dataset (SCD)**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the need for a dataset for carton detection and segmentation. They mention that existing datasets do not adequately cover carton categories, reinforcing the importance of the SCD.

In the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Stacked Carton Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the SCD, including its composition and the two subsets it contains: **Live Stacked Carton Dataset (LSCD)** and **Online Stacked Carton Dataset (OSCD)**. Here are the key details:

1. **Stacked Carton Dataset (SCD)**: This dataset consists of 16,136 images collected from various sources, including warehouses and the internet, with a total of 250,000 instance masks. It is designed for carton detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **Live Stacked Carton Dataset (LSCD)**: This subset contains images taken in real-world scenarios, specifically for carton stacking and unloading. It includes 7,735 images with detailed annotations.

3. **Online Stacked Carton Dataset (OSCD)**: This subset consists of images downloaded from the internet, containing 8,401 images. It is intended for pre-training and transfer learning tasks.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the LSCD and OSCD for their experiments, which further validates their significance.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide separate citations for the LSCD and OSCD since they are part of the SCD. However, I will ensure to cite the SCD properly.

The full citation for the Stacked Carton Dataset (SCD) is:
> Jinrong Yang, Shengkai Wu, Lijun Gou, Hangcheng Yu, Chenxi Lin, Jiazhuo Wang, Minxuan Li, and Xiaoping Li. *SCD: A Stacked Carton Dataset for Detection and Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the SCD as it encompasses both LSCD and OSCD. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets extracted from the paper.
