To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Process Regression constrained by Boundary Value Problems" by M. Gulian, A. Frankel, and L. Swiler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its applications, but it may not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors discuss various boundary value problems (BVPs) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods. They mention using synthetic data generated from specific mathematical functions, which may not correspond to publicly available datasets but are essential for their experiments. I will note these synthetic datasets as they are crucial for understanding the experimental setup.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets or methodologies that may have been adapted from previous works. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using synthetic data generated from the Helmholtz equation or the Dirichlet problem, I will document these as datasets used in their experiments, even though they are not traditional datasets. I will also look for any references to datasets that might have been used in previous studies that the authors are building upon.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
