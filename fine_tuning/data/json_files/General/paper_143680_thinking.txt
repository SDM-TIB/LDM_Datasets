To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning Approach for Railway Technical Map (RTM) Component Identification" by Obadage Rochana Rumalshan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves digitizing railway technical maps (RTMs) and mentions the use of deep learning and OCR techniques, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for digitized databases of railway track information and mention the complexity of RTMs. This sets the context for the datasets but does not provide specific names yet.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, particularly **subsection 3.2 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the initial dataset consists of **69 PDF pages of RTMs**, which were converted to JPEG format for processing. This is a clear identification of the dataset used.

The authors also specify that these RTMs represent a range of a single mile on each page, which is important for understanding the dataset's scope. However, they do not provide a formal name for the dataset, so I will refer to it as the "RTM Dataset" for clarity.

In **subsection 3.3 (Image labelling)**, the authors describe the components included in the dataset, such as Signal, Switch, Electric-Switch, Milepost, Control Point Name, Clearance Point, Crossing, and Crossing Label. This information is useful for understanding the dataset's content but does not constitute a separate dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset. However, the dataset appears to be original and does not reference an external source. Therefore, I will create a citation for the dataset based on the authors and the context provided in the paper.

The citation for the RTM Dataset will be:
> Obadage Rochana Rumalshan, Pramuka Weerasinghe, Mohamed Shaheer, Prabhath Gunathilake, and Erunika Dayaratna. *Transfer Learning Approach for Railway Technical Map (RTM) Component Identification*. University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, 2023.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
