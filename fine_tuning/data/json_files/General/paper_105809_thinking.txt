To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "ProSTformer: Pre-trained Progressive Space-Time Self-attention Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting" by Xiao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on two traffic datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **NYCTaxi Dataset**: This dataset consists of yellow taxi GPS trajectory data from New York City, covering the period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2015, with approximately 416 million trajectories. The authors partition NYC into a grid of 12 × 16 regions and create separate datasets for different time windows: NYCTaxi30min, NYCTaxi60min, and NYCTaxi90min.

2. **NYCBike Dataset**: This dataset includes GPS trajectory data for sharing bikes in New York City from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, totaling about 56 million trajectories. Similar to the NYCTaxi dataset, NYC is partitioned into 12 × 16 regions, and separate datasets are created for time windows: NYCBike30min, NYCBike60min, and NYCBike90min.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will also check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are not explicitly provided in the references, but I can infer that the datasets are based on the authors' own data collection efforts.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as required. The citations will be based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant external sources if needed.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
