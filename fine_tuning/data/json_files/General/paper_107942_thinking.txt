To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Convergence of Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Arbitrary Adaptive Online Model Pruning" by Hanhan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. They specifically mention using two datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR10**. I will take note of how these datasets are utilized in the context of their experiments.

In the **experiments subsection (5.1)**, the authors provide details about the datasets. They mention that MNIST is a common dataset for image classification, consisting of handwritten digits, while CIFAR10 is a dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
