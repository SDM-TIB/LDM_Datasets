To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SKEP: Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training for Sentiment Analysis" by Hao Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "three kinds of sentiment tasks," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. In Table 1, they list several datasets along with their statistics, which is crucial for identifying the datasets utilized in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**: This dataset is used for sentence-level sentiment classification. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.
   
2. **Amazon-2**: Another dataset used for sentence-level sentiment classification, with a specific mention of the original source.

3. **SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Sem-R and Sem-L)**: These datasets are used for aspect-level sentiment classification, and the authors provide a reference to the original SemEval task paper.

4. **MPQA 2.0**: This dataset is used for opinion role labeling, and the authors cite the original work that introduced this dataset.

Now, I will look up the full citations for each of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

- For **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In EMNLP 2013.

- For **Amazon-2**, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. *Character-level convolutional networks for text classification*. In NIPS 2015.

- For **SemEval 2014 Task 4 (Sem-R and Sem-L)**, the citation is:
  > Maria Pontiki, Dimitris Galanis, John Pavlopoulos, Harris Papageorgiou, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Suresh Manandhar. *SemEval-2014 task 4: Aspect based sentiment analysis*. In SemEval 2014.

- For **MPQA 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Janyce Wiebe, Theresa Wilson, and Claire Cardie. *Annotating expressions of opinions and emotions in language*. Language Resources and Evaluation, 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
