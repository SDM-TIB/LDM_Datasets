To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-based Algorithm for Operating Fully-Automatic Surgery" by Sina Saadati, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses a method for fully automated surgery and mentions the use of a U-net trained to detect endometriosis, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this training.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges and advancements in AI in surgery, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the research.

In the **Preliminaries section**, the author references a dataset called the **Glenda dataset**, which includes laparoscopic images related to endometriosis. This is a crucial dataset for my extraction. The author also mentions that this dataset is limited in size and does not differentiate between the locations of endometriosis, which is important context.

Moving to the **methodology**, I will look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of the Nahid algorithm and its application to isolated ovarian endometriosis. The author notes that new data has been collected and added to the dataset, but I need to clarify if this new dataset has a specific name or citation.

In the **results section**, the author discusses the evaluation of a neural network model for detecting endometrioma tissue, which implies that there are datasets used for training and testing this model. I will look for any specific mentions of these datasets.

Finally, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The Glenda dataset is referenced, and I will ensure to extract its full citation. If any new datasets were created or collected, I will note that they may not have formal citations yet.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
