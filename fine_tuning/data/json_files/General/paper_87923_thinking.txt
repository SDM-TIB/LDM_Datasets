To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Model Robustness Using Causal Knowledge" by Trent Kyono and Mihaela van der Schaar, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on both "publicly available and synthetic datasets." This indicates that there are at least two types of datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4, the authors describe their experiments in detail. They mention using "synthetic datasets" generated based on causal graphs, but they also refer to "several real-world examples." 

I will then focus on the **subsection 4.3 (Out-of-distribution robustness on real data)**, where the authors explicitly list four publicly available Kaggle datasets:

1. **Abalone Dataset**: This dataset contains 4,177 samples with attributes of abalones, used to predict the number of rings (age) based on various features.
   
2. **Bike Sharing Dataset**: This dataset includes 17,379 hourly samples of bike rentals in Washington D.C., aiming to predict bike rental counts based on weather data.

3. **Student Performance in Exams Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 students' standardized test scores and various demographic attributes, used to analyze factors affecting performance.

4. **Powerlifting Dataset**: This dataset comprises approximately 1.42 million records related to powerlifting, focusing on the first attempts of lifters in three events.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For the **Abalone Dataset**:
  > Mendes, R. *Abalone*. Kaggle, March 2019. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfomendes/abalone-dataset.

- For the **Bike Sharing Dataset**:
  > Fanaee, H. *Bike Sharing in Washington D.C.* Kaggle, March 2019. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database.

- For the **Student Performance in Exams Dataset**:
  > Kimmons, R. *Student Performance in Exams*. Kaggle, March 2019. URL: http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams.

- For the **Powerlifting Dataset**:
  > Powerlifting, O. *Powerlifting*. Kaggle, March 2019. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/open-powerlifting/powerlifting-database.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
