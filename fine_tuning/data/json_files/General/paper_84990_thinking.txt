To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Deep Learning to Count Albatrosses from Space" by Ellen Bowler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset of manually labeled imagery provided by the British Antarctic Survey, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of WV-3 images of four separate nesting colonies of Wandering Albatrosses. The specific colonies are Bird Island, Annenkov Island, Ile des Apotres, and Grand Coulee on Kerguelen Island. The authors also provide details about the number of albatrosses counted in each colony, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

The paper states that the dataset includes approximately 2000 birds and provides a breakdown of counts from different colonies:
- Bird Island: 935 albatrosses
- Annenkov Island: 161 albatrosses
- Ile des Apotres: 171 albatrosses
- Grand Coulee: 649 albatrosses

Additionally, the authors mention that counts from seven different observers were obtained for the Bird Island colony, which adds another layer of detail to the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to two key papers that describe the imagery and the manual labeling procedure:
1. For the WV-3 imagery, the citation is:
   > P. T. Fretwell, P. Scofield, and R. A. Phillips. *Using super-high resolution satellite imagery to census threatened albatrosses*. Ibis, vol. 159, no. 3, pp. 481–490, 2017.

2. For the manual labeling procedure, the citation is:
   > H. Weimerskirch, K. Delord, C. Barbraud, F. Le Bouard, P. G. Ryan, P. Fretwell, and C. Marteau. *Status and trends of albatrosses in the French southern territories, western Indian Ocean*. Polar Biology, pp. 1–10, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
