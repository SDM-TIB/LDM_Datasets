To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Instances Need More Care: Rewriting Prompts for Instances with LLMs in the Loop Yields Better Zero-Shot Performance" by Saurabh Srivastava et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a comprehensive evaluation across **13 datasets and 10 task types**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide a table summarizing the task types and associated datasets. I will note down each dataset along with its corresponding task type.

The paper lists the following datasets:

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile their full citations accurately as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly labeled with its name, description, and citation for easy reference.
