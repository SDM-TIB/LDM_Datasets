To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Strudel: Learning Structured-Decomposable Probabilistic Circuits" by Meihua Dang, Antonio Vergari, and Guy Van den Broeck, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for tractable probabilistic models and mention that they demonstrate their method on **20 standard benchmarks**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in **Section 6**, where they evaluate Strudel on various datasets. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **NLTCS**: A dataset used for learning probabilistic models in the context of the NLTCS benchmark.
2. **MSNBC**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of probabilistic circuits.
3. **KDD**: A dataset from the KDD Cup, commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.
4. **Plants**: A dataset related to plant classification tasks.
5. **Audio**: A dataset used for audio classification tasks.
6. **Jester**: A dataset for collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.
7. **Netflix**: A dataset from the Netflix Prize competition, used for movie recommendation.
8. **Accidents**: A dataset related to traffic accidents.
9. **Retail**: A dataset used for retail analysis.
10. **PUMSB-Star**: A dataset from the PUMS project, used for demographic analysis.
11. **DNA**: A dataset related to DNA sequences.
12. **Kosarek**: A dataset used for collaborative filtering.
13. **MSWeb**: A dataset related to web usage mining.
14. **Book**: A dataset related to book recommendations.
15. **EachMovie**: A dataset from the EachMovie project, used for movie recommendations.
16. **WebKB**: A dataset for web page classification.
17. **Routers-52**: A dataset related to network traffic.
18. **20News-Grp**: A dataset for text classification from the 20 Newsgroups.
19. **BBC**: A dataset for news categorization.
20. **Ad**: A dataset related to advertising click-through rates.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be explicitly listed as datasets, but I will look for any papers or reports that describe these datasets.

For example, the citation for the **Netflix dataset** is:
> Bennett, J., & Lanning, S. (2007). The Netflix Prize. In Proceedings of the KDD Cup and Workshop, 2007.

The citation for the **20 Newsgroups dataset** is:
> Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 1995.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for review or further processing, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the citations.
