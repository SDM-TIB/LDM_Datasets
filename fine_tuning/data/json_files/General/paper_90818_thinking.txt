To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Training for Large Neural Language Models" by Xiaodong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various NLP tasks and datasets, which indicates that datasets are integral to their research. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their purpose and characteristics.

The datasets mentioned in this section include:

1. **Wikipedia**: Used for BERT pre-training, consisting of an English Wikipedia dump (13GB).
2. **OPENWEBTEXT**: A dataset derived from public Reddit content (38GB), used for continual pre-training of RoBERTa.
3. **STORIES**: A subset of CommonCrawl (31GB), also used for continual pre-training of RoBERTa.
4. **GLUE**: A benchmark for evaluating general language understanding, which includes multiple tasks and datasets.
5. **SQuAD v1.1 and v2.0**: Datasets for machine reading comprehension, sourced from Wikipedia articles.
6. **ANLI**: A large-scale NLI benchmark dataset collected through an iterative process.
7. **Adversarial SQuAD**: A dataset for evaluating reading comprehension systems with adversarial examples.
8. **HELLASWAG**: A challenging dataset for grounded commonsense inference.
9. **SWAG**: A large-scale adversarial dataset for grounded commonsense inference.
10. **BC2GM**: A dataset for gene name entity recognition from the BioCreative II workshop.
11. **NCBI**: A disease corpus containing annotations from PubMed abstracts.
12. **JNLPBA**: A biomedical entity recognition shared task dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
