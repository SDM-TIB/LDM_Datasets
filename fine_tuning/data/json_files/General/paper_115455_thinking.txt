To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extend and Explain: Interpreting Very Long Language Models" by Joel Stremmel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the parts that discuss the cohort and datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **Optum Chart Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6,526,116 full-length medical charts for Medicare patients from 2017-2018. It is used for training and validation of the models. The authors provide details about how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset contains de-identified clinical records for ICU patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The authors specifically use a subset of discharge summaries from this dataset, which includes 11,371 notes and the top 50 most common ICD diagnoses.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I found are:

- For the **Optum Chart Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stremmel, J., Hill, B. L., Hertzberg, J., Murillo, J., Allotey, L., & Halperin, E. (2022). Extend and Explain: Interpreting Very Long Language Models. *Proceedings of Machine Learning Research*, 193:1â€“43.

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. H., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., Moody, B., Szolovits, P., Celi, L. A., & Mark, R. G. (2016). MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database. *Scientific Data*, 3:160035.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further use.
