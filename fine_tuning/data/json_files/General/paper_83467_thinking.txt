To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Learning for Image-Based Malware Classification" by Niket Bhodia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize image analysis for malware detection and classification, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference previous works that utilized image-based techniques for malware analysis, hinting at the use of specific datasets. However, I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets in the methodology section.

In **section 2 (Methodology)**, the authors clearly outline the datasets used:

1. **Malimg Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,339 malware images from 25 families. The authors mention that these images require no preprocessing before analysis.

2. **Malicia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 11,668 malware binaries from 54 families. The authors note that these binaries must be converted into images for analysis, and they exclude certain samples that do not meet specific criteria, resulting in 9,895 usable binaries from 51 families.

Additionally, the authors mention two benign datasets:
- A dataset of 3,304 binaries typically found on a modern Windows PC.
- A dataset containing 704 binaries from the Cygwin library.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Malimg Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nataraj, L., Karthikeyan, S., Jacob, G., & Manjunath, B. (2011). *Malware images: Visualization and automatic classification*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security, VizSec â€™11.

- For the **Malicia Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nappa, A., Rafique, M. Z., & Caballero, J. (2015). *The Malicia dataset: Identification and analysis of drive-by download operations*. International Journal of Information Security, 14(1), 15-33.

The benign datasets do not have specific citations provided in the paper, as they are common datasets used in malware analysis.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
