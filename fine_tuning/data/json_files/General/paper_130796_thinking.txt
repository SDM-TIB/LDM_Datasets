To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSED: Sound Event Detection with Denoising Diffusion" by Swapnil Bhosale et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments were conducted on the **Urban-SED** and **EPIC-Sounds** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be documented.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments section, the authors provide descriptions of both datasets:

1. **Urban-SED**: This dataset is described as publicly available for sound event detection in urban environments, complete with detailed annotations, including onset and offset times for each sound event.

2. **EPIC-Sounds**: This dataset consists of over 36,000 audio recordings totaling more than 500 hours of audio, covering a variety of sound classes in different environments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Urban-SED**, the citation is:
  > Salamon, J., Jacoby, C., & Bello, J. P. (2014). A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research. In ACM International Conference on Multimedia.

- For **EPIC-Sounds**, the citation is:
  > Huh, J., Chalk, J., Kazakos, E., Damen, D., & Zisserman, A. (2023). EPIC-SOUNDS: A Large-Scale Dataset of Actions that Sound. In IEEE ICASSP.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
