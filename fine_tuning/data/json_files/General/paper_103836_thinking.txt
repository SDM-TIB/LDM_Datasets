To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Data-Driven Convergence Bidding Strategy Based on Reverse Engineering of Market Participantsâ€™ Performance: A Case of California ISO" by Ehsan Samani et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "publicly available electricity market data" for their analysis, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the analysis of "three years of real-world California ISO market data," which provides a timeframe and context for the dataset.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the data used for their analysis. They mention that they analyzed "all the submitted convergence bids, D-LMPs, R-LMPs, and the net cleared CBs" over the three years (2017, 2018, and 2019). This indicates that the dataset includes various types of data related to convergence bidding in the California ISO market.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any specific details about the dataset, such as its size or structure. They mention analyzing "6.6 million CBs," which gives a sense of the dataset's scale.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The authors refer to the California ISO Open Access Same-time Information System as a source for their data. The citation for this dataset is:
> California ISO Open Access Same-time Information System, [Online]: http://oasis.caiso.com.

Additionally, they mention that their analysis is based on data from various studies and reports, which may also be relevant. However, the primary dataset appears to be the California ISO market data.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any further analysis or use of the data.
