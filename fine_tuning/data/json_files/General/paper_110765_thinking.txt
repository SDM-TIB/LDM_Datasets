To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fuzzy Expert System for Stock Portfolio Selection: An Application to Bombay Stock Exchange" by Gour Sundar Mitra Thakur et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a fuzzy expert system model for stock evaluation and ranking, which suggests that historical stock data may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that historical data for four performance indicators (Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E), Price to Book Value (P/B), Price to Sales ratio (P/S), and Long Term Debt to Equity ratio (LTDER)) were collected for all registered stocks under the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) from FY 2003-04 to FY 2011-12. This indicates that the dataset includes historical financial data for multiple stocks over several years.

In the **results section**, the authors provide a table listing the top 10 stocks based on their model's output for FY 2012-13, which includes the names of the stocks and their corresponding defuzzified values. This reinforces the idea that the dataset is related to stock performance metrics.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, it appears that the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from historical financial data available from various web sources like www.capitaline.com, www.bseindia.com, and www.nseindia.com.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Historical Stock Data**: This dataset includes historical data for 30 stocks registered under the Bombay Stock Exchange, covering the period from FY 2003-04 to FY 2011-12. The data consists of four performance indicators: P/E, P/B, P/S, and LTDER.

2. **Top 10 Stocks for FY 2012-13**: This dataset includes the names of the top 10 stocks ranked based on the fuzzy expert system's evaluation for the fiscal year 2012-13, along with their defuzzified values.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the data sources are general websites related to stock market information, and I will not be able to provide specific citations for the datasets as they are not formally published datasets.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
