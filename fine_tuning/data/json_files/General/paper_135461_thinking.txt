To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LeanDojo: Theorem Proving with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models" by Kaiyu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that LeanDojo includes "toolkits, data, models, and benchmarks," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in theorem proving and mention the creation of LeanDojo as a solution. They highlight the construction of a benchmark consisting of "98,734 theorems and proofs extracted from Leanâ€™s math library." This is a clear indication of a dataset.

In the **Datasets and Benchmarks** section, I will look for specific details about the datasets. The authors describe the **LeanDojo Benchmark**, which is composed of:
1. **98,734 theorems and proofs**: This dataset is extracted from Lean's math library and is used for training and evaluation.
2. **217,776 tactics**: These tactics are associated with the theorems and are part of the dataset.
3. **129,243 premises**: This includes definitions and theorems that can be used as premises in proofs.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors provide a DOI link for the LeanDojo Benchmark, which is crucial for proper citation:
- LeanDojo Benchmark: 
  > LeanDojo Benchmark. *LeanDojo: Theorem Proving with Retrieval-Augmented Language Models*. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8016385.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention the use of other datasets for evaluation, specifically:
- **MiniF2F Dataset**: 
  > Kunhao Zheng, Jesse Michael Han, and Stanislas Polu. *MiniF2F: A Cross-System Benchmark for Formal Olympiad-Level Mathematics*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2022.
  
- **ProofNet Dataset**: 
  > Zhangir Azerbayev, Bartosz Piotrowski, Hailey Schoelkopf, Edward W Ayers, Dragomir Radev, and Jeremy Avigad. *ProofNet: Autoformalizing and Formally Proving Undergraduate-Level Mathematics*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.12433, 2023.

Now, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
