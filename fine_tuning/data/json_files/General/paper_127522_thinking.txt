To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models as Tool Makers" by Tianle Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their approach across various complex reasoning tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention six datasets sourced from BigBench, including:

1. **Logical Deduction (5)**: A dataset designed for logical reasoning tasks.
2. **Tracking Shuffled Objects (5)**: A dataset focused on tracking objects that have been shuffled.
3. **Dyck Language**: A dataset related to the Dyck language, which involves balanced parentheses.
4. **Word Sorting**: A dataset for sorting words alphabetically.
5. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: A dataset that involves solving problems related to the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
6. **Scheduling Meeting**: A dataset constructed to simulate scheduling tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the BigBench paper, which provides details about the datasets used in their experiments.

The citation for the BigBench paper is:
> Srivastava, A., Rastogi, A., Rao, A., Awal, A. A. M. S., Abid, A., Fisch, A. R. B., Brown, A. R., Gupta, A., Garriga-Alonso, A., et al. *Beyond the imitation game: Quantifying and extrapolating the capabilities of language models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.04615, 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
