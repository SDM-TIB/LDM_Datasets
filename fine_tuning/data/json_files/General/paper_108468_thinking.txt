To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two-stage architectural fine-tuning with neural architecture search using early-stopping in image classification" by Youngkee Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of gathering high-quality data and mentions the use of transfer learning, which often relies on specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention using **ImageNet** as the source dataset and **CIFAR10** as the target dataset for their transfer learning experiments.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The paper states that the experiments involve fine-tuning models pretrained on ImageNet and testing them on CIFAR10. This confirms that both datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for proper attribution and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined along with its citation for future reference.
