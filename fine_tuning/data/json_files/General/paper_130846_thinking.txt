To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Region Proposal Network for Enhanced Few-Shot Object Detection" by Zeyu Shangguan and Mohammad Rostami, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on the **COCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **PASCAL VOC** and **COCO** datasets for their experiments. They describe the PASCAL VOC dataset as containing images from various real-world scenes with bounding box annotations for different object classes. The COCO dataset is also described as containing bounding box annotations around objects in complex scenes.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88, 303–338.

2. **COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S.J., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 740–755.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **PASCAL VOC**: A dataset commonly used for object detection, containing images with bounding box annotations for various object classes.
- **COCO**: A dataset that provides a diverse collection of images with bounding box annotations around objects in complex scenes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
