To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Simple Regularisation for Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Distillation" by Martin Ferianc and Miguel Rodrigues, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the main body of the paper for specific dataset information.

Next, I will look for sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**. In this section, the authors often describe the datasets used for their experiments, including details about their characteristics and how they were utilized in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is used for digit recognition and consists of over 600,000 labeled digits. It is commonly used for training and evaluating machine learning models in computer vision tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
