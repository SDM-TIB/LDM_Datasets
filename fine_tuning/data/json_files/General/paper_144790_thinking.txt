To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMEmbed: Rethinking Lightweight LLM’s Genuine Function in Text Classification" by Chun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors performed extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors detail their experimental setups. Here, they explicitly list five widely-used text classification benchmarks:

1. **SST-2**: This dataset is sampled from snippets of Rotten Tomatoes HTML files, containing 67,349 training examples and 872 testing examples, with a maximum length of 56 words.

2. **MR**: The Movie Review dataset consists of 40,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples, with a maximum length of 2,470 words.

3. **AGNews**: This dataset includes 120,000 training examples and 7,600 testing examples, categorized into four types of news articles, with a maximum length of 177 words.

4. **R8**: A subset of the Reuters collection, R8 contains 5,485 training documents and 2,189 testing documents, with a maximum length of 964 words.

5. **R52**: Another subset of the Reuters collection, R52 consists of 6,532 training documents and 2,568 testing documents, with a maximum length of 1,039 words.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SST-2**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
