To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Study of Positional Encoding Approaches for Audio Spectrogram Transformers" by Leonardo Pepino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their model on **Audioset** and **ESC-50**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of the datasets in the context of their research. They specifically mention that the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) was trained on **Audioset** and achieved state-of-the-art results on both **Audioset** and **ESC-50**.

In the **methods section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. The authors provide a thorough explanation of **Audioset**, stating it contains over 2 million 10-second audio clips with multi-label annotations across 527 classes. They also mention the specific subsets they used for training and evaluation.

For **ESC-50**, the authors describe it as a dataset for environmental sound classification, consisting of 2000 recordings organized into 50 classes. This information confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **Audioset**, the citation is:
   > Jort F. Gemmeke, Daniel P. W. Ellis, Dylan Freedman, Aren Jansen, Wade Lawrence, et al. "Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events." In ICASSP 2017.

2. For **ESC-50**, the citation is:
   > Karol J. Piczak. "ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification." In Proceedings of the 23rd Annual ACM Conference on Multimedia, 2015.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
