To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Baseline Pruning-Based Approach to Trojan Detection in Neural Networks" by Peter Bajcsy and Michael Majurski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using **Round 1 and Round 2 TrojAI Challenge datasets** for their experiments. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Input Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Round 1 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 models, 3 architectures (ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121), 5 predicted classes, and 100 clean images per class. The dataset has a 50:50 split of labels between clean and poisoned models.

2. **Round 2 Dataset**: This dataset includes 1104 models, 22 architectures, with the number of predicted classes varying between 10 ± 5 or 20 ± 5, and the number of clean images per class varying between 10 or 20 times the number of classes. It also has a 50:50 split of labels between clean and poisoned models.

I will confirm the details of these datasets by cross-referencing with the **References section** to ensure I have the correct citations. The authors mention the TrojAI challenge datasets, which are described in a specific reference:

- For the **TrojAI Challenge datasets**, the citation is:
  > IARPA, Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency: Trojans in Artificial Intelligence (TrojAI), https://pages.nist.gov/trojai/ (1 2020).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations. Each dataset will be clearly defined, including the number of models, architectures, classes, and images, along with the appropriate citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
