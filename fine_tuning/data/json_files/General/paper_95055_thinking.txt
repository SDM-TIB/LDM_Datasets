To extract datasets from the research paper titled "It’s not Greek to mBERT: Inducing Word-Level Translations from Multilingual BERT" by Hila Gonen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of methods using multilingual BERT (mBERT), which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using **NorthEuraLex**, a lexical database that provides translations of words into multiple languages. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide details about the dataset used for evaluating their translation methods. They specify that NorthEuraLex contains translations for 1,016 words into 107 languages, which is crucial information for documenting the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for NorthEuraLex. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Johannes Dellert, Thora Daneyko, Alla Münch, Alina Ladygina, Armin Buch, Natalie Clarius, Ilja Grigorjew, Mohamed Balabel, Hizniye Isabella Boga, Zalina Baysarova, et al. *Northeuralex: a wide-coverage lexical database of northern eurasia*. Language Resources and Evaluation, pages 1–29, 2019.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The authors also reference the **TED corpus**, which is used for their experiments involving mBERT representations. I will need to find the citation for this dataset as well.

The citation for the TED corpus is:
> Qi Ye, Sachan Devendra, Felix Matthieu, Padmanabhan Sarguna, and Neubig Graham. *When and why are pre-trained word embeddings useful for neural machine translation*. In HLT-NAACL, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
