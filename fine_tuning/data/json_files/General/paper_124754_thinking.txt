To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing for Idiosyncratic Treatment Effect Heterogeneity" by Jaime Ramirez-Cuellar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a microfinance experiment in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this experiment.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **results** sections. In this paper, the author refers to a microcredit experiment conducted by Augsburg et al. (2015) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is likely to be the primary dataset used for analysis.

In the **application section**, the author describes the microcredit experiment in detail, mentioning that it targeted 1,196 loan applicants, with 628 randomly selected for a loan. This provides specific information about the dataset, including the sample size and context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset used in the microcredit experiment. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the microcredit experiment:
  > Augsburg, B., De Haas, R., Harmgart, H., & Meghir, C. (2015). *The Impacts of Microcredit: Evidence from Bosnia and Herzegovina*. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 7(1), 183â€“203.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Microcredit Experiment Dataset**: This dataset includes information on 1,196 loan applicants, with 628 receiving loans. It contains various baseline characteristics and outcomes related to self-employment, income, and business activities.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will facilitate further analysis or integration into other research efforts.
