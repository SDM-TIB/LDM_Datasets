To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Online Instrumental Variable Regression: Regrets for Endogeneity and Bandit Feedback" by Riccardo Della Vecchia and Debabrota Basu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of **synthetic data** and **real data** for experiments, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of **observational datasets** for their analysis, which suggests that they may provide details about these datasets later in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This data is generated to simulate scenarios of endogeneity, specifically for the experiments comparing O2SLS and Online Ridge Regression. The authors describe the generation process, including the parameters used (e.g., Bernoulli distribution for events, normal distributions for prices and sales).

2. **Real Data**: The authors use a dataset on gasoline consumption in the United States, which spans from 1970 to 1999. They provide details about the variables included in this dataset, such as the price index, disposable income, and price indices of various vehicle types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following sources:

- For the **synthetic data** generation, the authors do not provide a specific citation since it is generated based on their own methodology.
  
- For the **real data** on gasoline consumption, the citation is:
  > Heij, C., Heij, C., de Boer, P., Franses, P. H., Kloek, T., van Dijk, H. K., et al. *Econometric methods with applications in business and economics*. Oxford University Press, 2004.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: Generated for the purpose of the experiments to simulate endogeneity scenarios. No specific citation is provided as it is based on the authors' methodology.

2. **Gasoline Consumption Dataset**: A real dataset used to analyze the consumption of motor gasoline in the United States, including various economic factors.
   - Citation: Heij, C., Heij, C., de Boer, P., Franses, P. H., Kloek, T., van Dijk, H. K., et al. *Econometric methods with applications in business and economics*. Oxford University Press, 2004.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
