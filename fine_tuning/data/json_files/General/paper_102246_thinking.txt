To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting the Convergence of Reinforcement Learning-based Auto-pruning Using Historical Data" by Jiandong Mu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of historical data to improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning-based auto-pruning, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss various methods and challenges related to deep neural network (DNN) pruning, but I need to find explicit references to datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to pinpoint the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets related to DNN models, but they do not explicitly name any datasets in the provided text. Therefore, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may include datasets. 

I will look for papers that are known to provide datasets for DNN training or pruning tasks. If the authors reference any datasets, I will extract the full citations for those datasets.

For example, if they reference a dataset like the **ImageNet dataset**, I would note the citation as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

If they mention any other datasets, I will follow the same process to ensure I have the full citation for each.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names and citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their proper citations.
