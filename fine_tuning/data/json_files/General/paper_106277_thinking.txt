To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Interaction Modelling in Vision Transformer via Super Tokens" by Ammarah Farooq et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental details sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed model achieves results on **Imagenet-1K** and several downstream datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **section 4.1 (Architectural Variants)**, they mention using **ImageNet1K** for training their main models. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision.

In **section 4.2 (Implementation Details)**, the authors specify that they used **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **iNaturalist** datasets for fine-tuning their models. This provides additional datasets that are relevant to their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **ImageNet1K**, the citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

2. For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. For **iNaturalist**, the citation is:
   > Grant Van Horn, Oisin Mac Aodha, Yang Song, Yin Cui, Chen Sun, Alex Shepard, Hartwig Adam, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The iNaturalist species classification and detection dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 8769–8778, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
