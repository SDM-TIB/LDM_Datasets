To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PALM: Pre-training an Autoencoding & Autoregressive Language Model for Context-conditioned Generation" by Bin Bi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that PALM achieves state-of-the-art results on various language generation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 3.1 (Pre-training Configuration)**, they mention using documents from **English Wikipedia** and **BookCorpus** as the pre-training corpus. This indicates that these are the datasets used for training the model.

In **section 3.3 (Fine-tuning on Generative QA)**, the authors refer to the **MARCO dataset** for evaluating generative QA models. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of QA pairs in the training, dev, and test sets.

In **section 3.4 (Fine-tuning on Summarization)**, they mention using the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** and the **Gigaword dataset** for the summarization task. This section provides context on how these datasets are utilized in their experiments.

In **section 3.5 (Fine-tuning on Question Generation)**, the authors specify the **SQuAD 1.1 dataset** for the question generation task. This is another dataset that needs to be cited.

Finally, in **section 3.6 (Fine-tuning on Response Generation)**, they mention the **Cornell Movie Dialog corpus** for conversational response generation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
