To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Case Report on the 'A.I. Locked-In Problem': Social Concerns with Modern NLP" by Yoshija Walter, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and main body of the paper** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview, but I will need to look deeper into the sections that discuss experiments or case studies, as these are likely to contain information about datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **case report section** (Section 2) and any other relevant sections that may describe experiments or applications of the NLP models discussed. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments or any data sources referenced by the author.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. I will look for any papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets directly, I will search for the original sources of the datasets online or in academic databases to ensure I have the correct citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in the appropriate format.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
