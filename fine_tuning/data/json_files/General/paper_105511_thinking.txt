To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Colossal-AI: A Unified Deep Learning System For Large-Scale Parallel Training" by Shenggui Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the need for large-scale datasets for training deep learning models, which suggests that datasets may be discussed later in the paper. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments** section, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

I will also check the **background** and **implementation** sections, as they may provide context or additional details about the datasets used in the experiments. If the authors refer to any well-known datasets, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
