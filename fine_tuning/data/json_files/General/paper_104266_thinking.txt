To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unpacking the Interdependent Systems of Discrimination: Ableist Bias in NLP Systems through an Intersectional Lens" by Saad Hassan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses analyses based on word predictions of a large-scale BERT language model, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach to analyzing ableist bias in the BERT model. They mention using a fill-in-the-blank analysis with a specific lexicon related to disability, gender, and race. This indicates that they created a dataset of sentence fragments to feed into the BERT model.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a detailed lexicon used for creating sentence fragments, which includes various referents related to disability, gender identity, and race. This table is crucial as it outlines the specific terms used in their analysis.

Additionally, in the **results section**, the authors mention that they generated a dataset of sentences based on their analysis, specifically stating that "the dataset of sentences has been made available for research." They provide a link to the dataset, which is a significant finding.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Dataset of Sentences**: The authors created a dataset based on their analysis of BERT's predictions. The dataset is available at:
   > Saad Hassan, Matt Huenerfauth, and Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm. *Unpacking the Interdependent Systems of Discrimination: Ableist Bias in NLP Systems through an Intersectional Lens*. Available at: https://github.com/saadhassan96/ableist-bias.

2. **Lexicon for Sentence Fragments**: While not a traditional dataset, the lexicon used for creating the sentence fragments is essential for understanding the context of the analysis. The reference for the lexicon is derived from Hutchinson et al. (2020):
   > Ben Hutchinson, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Emily Denton, Kellie Webster, Yu Zhong, and Stephen Denuyl. *Social biases in NLP models as barriers for persons with disabilities*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 5491â€“5501, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources as required.
