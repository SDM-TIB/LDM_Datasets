To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Reduction Method Comparison Towards Explainability and Efficiency in Cybersecurity Intrusion Detection Systems" by Adam Lehavi and Seongtae Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several common datasets used in intrusion detection systems, specifically listing **NSL-KDD, KDD-Cup’99, UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS2017, Kyoto, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** section. In this paper, the authors specifically highlight the **CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset** as the primary dataset used for their experiments. They describe it as a dataset created by the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) and the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) in 2018, which simulates network data for testing intrusion detection systems.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset is indeed the one used for performance evaluation. The authors report their findings based on this dataset, which reinforces its significance in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The relevant citations are:

- For **CSE-CIC-IDS2018**, the citation is:
  > "A realistic cyber defense dataset (CSE-CIC-IDS2018) - registry of open data on AWS." [Online]. Available: https://registry.opendata.aws/cse-cic-ids2018/

- For **NSL-KDD**, the citation is:
  > M. Tavallaee, E. Bagheri, W. Lu, and A. A. Ghorbani, "A detailed analysis of the KDD CUP 99 data set," in Proceedings of the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Communications and Computer Networks (ICCCN), pp. 1-6, 2009.

- For **KDD-Cup’99**, the citation is:
  > "KDD Cup 1999 Data," [Online]. Available: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

- For **UNSW-NB15**, the citation is:
  > A. Moustafa and A. Slay, "The UNSW-NB15 dataset for network intrusion detection systems," in Proceedings of the 2015 4th International Conference on Information Systems Security and Privacy (ICISSP), pp. 1-12, 2015.

- For **CIC-IDS2017**, the citation is:
  > "CICIDS 2017 Dataset," [Online]. Available: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2020.html

- For **Kyoto**, the citation is:
  > "Kyoto 2006+ Dataset," [Online]. Available: http://www.takakura.com/kyoto/kyoto_data.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
