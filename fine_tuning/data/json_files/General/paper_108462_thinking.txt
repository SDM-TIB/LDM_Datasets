To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cost-Efficient Distributed Learning via Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits" by Maximilian Egger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, features, or any specific attributes that define the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because the citation provides the necessary context and credit to the original sources of the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MNIST," I will look for the original paper that introduced the MNIST dataset and note its citation. Similarly, if they refer to any other datasets, I will ensure to find and record their citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of the datasets used.
3. Note the names and characteristics of the datasets.
4. Check the References section for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
