To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Building a Competitive Associative Classifier" by Nitakshi Sood and Osmar Zaiane, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **15 UCI datasets** for their experiments, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding their work.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **introduction** and **methodology** sections. The introduction discusses the significance of associative classifiers and mentions the use of UCI datasets, but does not specify their names. Therefore, I will need to check the **experimental results section** for more details.

In **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, the authors present a table comparing classification accuracy across various datasets. The datasets listed include:

1. **Adult**
2. **Anneal**
3. **Breast**
4. **Flare**
5. **Glass**
6. **Heart**
7. **Hepatitis**
8. **Horse**
9. **Iris**
10. **Led7**
11. **Mushroom**
12. **PageBlocks**
13. **Pima**
14. **Wine**
15. **Zoo**

These datasets are explicitly mentioned in the context of their experiments, confirming their relevance.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The UCI Machine Learning Repository is a common source for these datasets, and I will look for the appropriate citations for each dataset. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

With these citations, I have successfully extracted the datasets used in the paper along with their full citations. Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
