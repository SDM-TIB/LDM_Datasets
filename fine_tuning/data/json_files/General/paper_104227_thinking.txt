To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GT U-Net: A U-Net Like Group Transformer Network" by Yunxiang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a "collected tooth root segmentation dataset" and the "public retina dataset DRIVE." This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In section 3.1, they describe the **tooth root segmentation dataset**, which consists of 248 X-ray images annotated by three stomatologists. This dataset is specifically created for their study, so I will note its details.

In section 3.4, the authors discuss the **DRIVE dataset**, which is a well-known public dataset for retinal image segmentation. They mention that it consists of 40 randomly selected color fundus retinal images and that it is split into training and testing groups.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **tooth root segmentation dataset**, since it is a newly created dataset by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as follows:
   - **Tooth Root Segmentation Dataset**: Contains 248 root canal therapy X-ray images annotated by three stomatologists.

2. For the **DRIVE dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation is:
   > Joes Staal, Michael D Abr`amoﬀ, Meindert Niemeijer, Max A Viergever, and Bram Van Ginneken. *Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 23(4):501–509, 2004.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Tooth Root Segmentation Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors containing 248 X-ray images for tooth root segmentation.
- **DRIVE Dataset**: A public dataset consisting of 40 color fundus retinal images used for retinal vessel segmentation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable.
