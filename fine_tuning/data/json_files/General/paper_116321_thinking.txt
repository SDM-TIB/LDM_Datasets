To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Lyrics Recognition with Self-Supervised Learning" by Xiangyu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their self-supervised learning models on the **DAMP music dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look into the **Methodology** section, particularly **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **DAMP - Sing! 300x30x2 dataset**: This dataset contains 149.1 hours of singing clips without background music. The authors specify that they used the default train/dev/test split, which includes 66 songs for validation and 70 for testing.

2. **MusDB dataset**: This dataset is used to explore the impact of background music on the performance of self-supervised learning models. It consists of 150 full-length audios, with versions both with and without background music.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **DAMP dataset**, the citation is:
  > "Smule Sing! 300x30x2 dataset," Dec. 2018.

- For the **MusDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zafar Rafii, Antoine Liutkus, Fabian-Robert St√∂ter, Stylianos Ioannis Mimilakis, and Rachel Bittner. "The MUSDB18 corpus for music separation," Dec. 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or processing.
