To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperbolic Learning with Synthetic Captions for Open-World Detection" by Fanjie Kong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various open-world detection benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of open-world detection and mention the use of large-scale image captioning datasets. They specifically reference **MS-COCO captions** and **conceptual captions** as examples of datasets used for training. This is a strong indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention evaluating their method on several benchmarks, including **COCO**, **LVIS**, **Object Detection in the Wild (ODiW)**, and **RefCOCO**. I will need to confirm the details of these datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MS-COCO**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

2. **LVIS**: The citation is:
   > Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

3. **Object Detection in the Wild (ODiW)**: The citation is:
   > Liunian Harold Li, Pengchuan Zhang, Haotian Zhang, Jianwei Yang, Chunyuan Li, Yiwu Zhong, Lijuan Wang, Lu Yuan, Lei Zhang, Jenq-Neng Hwang, et al. *Grounded Language-Image Pre-Training*. In CVPR, 2022.

4. **RefCOCO**: The citation is:
   > Sahar Kazemzadeh, Vicente Ordonez, Mark Matten, and Tamara Berg. *ReferItGame: Referring to Objects in Photographs of Natural Scenes*. In EMNLP, 2014.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is crucial for understanding the context and validity of the findings presented in the paper.
