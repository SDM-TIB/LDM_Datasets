To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the intrinsic robustness to noise of some leading classifiers and symmetric loss function - an empirical evaluation" by Hugo Le Baher et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on evaluating classifiers under noisy conditions, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methodology)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their benchmark. They mention that they collected publicly available datasets from sources like NASA and UCI, which are commonly used in benchmarks. The specific datasets are listed in **Table 1**, which includes important characteristics such as the name, number of numerical and categorical features, total number of examples, and the percentage of the minority class.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Trucks**: 76,000 examples, 0 numerical features, 170 categorical features, minority class percentage of 1.8%.
2. **Bank**: 41,188 examples, 10 numerical features, 10 categorical features, minority class percentage of 3.3%.
3. **PC1**: 1,109 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 6.9%.
4. **CM1**: 498 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 9.8%.
5. **KC1**: 2,105 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 15.4%.
6. **KC3**: 194 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 18.6%.
7. **JM1**: 10,885 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 19.3%.
8. **KC2**: 522 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 20.5%.
9. **Adult**: 48,842 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 23.9%.
10. **Breast Cancer**: 699 examples, 0 numerical features, 40 categorical features, minority class percentage of 39.4%.
11. **Spambase**: 4,601 examples, 5 numerical features, 17 categorical features, minority class percentage of 44.8%.
12. **Eye State**: 14,980 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 44.3%.
13. **Phishing**: 11,055 examples, 0 numerical features, 46 categorical features, minority class percentage of 46.6%.
14. **Mushroom**: 8,416 examples, 0 numerical features, 22 categorical features, minority class percentage of 68%.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are publicly available datasets from NASA and UCI. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are commonly used in the literature and can be found in the respective repositories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, characteristics, and any relevant notes about their sources. This will ensure that the information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
