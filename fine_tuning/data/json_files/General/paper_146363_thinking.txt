To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Partial Group Convolutions for Input-Aware Partial Equivariance of Rotations and Color-Shifts" by Hyunsu Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on both toy and real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, they mention four datasets: **MNIST67-180**, **CIFAR10**, **ColorMNIST**, and **Flowers102**. I will take note of each dataset's specific characteristics and how they relate to the experiments conducted.

1. **MNIST67-180**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and is specifically designed for classification tasks involving digits 6 and 7, along with their corresponding 180°-rotated versions. The authors reference the original MNIST dataset for context.

2. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This dataset is commonly used for image classification tasks.

3. **ColorMNIST**: This dataset consists of colored digit images presented against a gray background, requiring classification based on both the digit and its color. It is noted for having a long-tailed distribution of classes.

4. **Flowers102**: This dataset contains 102 categories of flowers, with each category having between 40 and 258 images. It is used to evaluate the model's performance on color shifts and partial equivariance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For **CIFAR10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **ColorMNIST**: The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, as it is a modified version of MNIST. However, it is important to note that it is based on the original MNIST dataset.

- For **Flowers102**:
  > M. Nilsback and A. Zisserman. *Automated flower classification over a large number of classes*. In Proceedings of the Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing (ICVGIP), 2008, pp. 722–729.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
