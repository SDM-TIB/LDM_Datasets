To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SemEval-2020 Task 10: Emphasis Selection for Written Text in Visual Media" by Amirreza Shirani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a shared task that involves designing automatic methods for emphasis selection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Data Collection section** (Section 3), as it is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the task. Here, the authors mention that the data is an integration of two datasets created from texts collected from Adobe Spark and Wisdom Quotes. This is a clear indication that I need to extract information about these datasets.

The two datasets mentioned are:

1. **Spark Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,195 instances collected from Adobe Spark, featuring various subjects from flyers, posters, advertisements, and motivational memes on social media.

2. **Quotes Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,681 instances of quotes from well-known authors, sourced from Wisdom Quotes.

The paper states that the combined dataset, referred to as the **Emphasis Dataset**, includes a total of 3,876 instances, which is a crucial detail to note.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the Spark and Quotes datasets, as they are likely proprietary or not formally published. Instead, I will note that the Spark dataset is from Adobe Spark and the Quotes dataset is from Wisdom Quotes, providing their URLs for reference:

- **Spark Dataset**: Available at [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com)
- **Quotes Dataset**: Available at [Wisdom Quotes](http://wisdomquotes.com)

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Spark Dataset**: A collection of 1,195 instances from Adobe Spark, featuring various subjects in visual media.
2. **Quotes Dataset**: A collection of 2,681 instances of quotes from well-known authors, sourced from Wisdom Quotes.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and their respective sources. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with proper citations where applicable.
