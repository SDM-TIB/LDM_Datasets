To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ℓ0 Regularized Structured Sparsity Convolutional Neural Networks" by Kevin Bui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experiments section typically details the datasets employed in the study.

In the **experiments section (Section 3)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification.

2. **CIFAR 10/100 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as having 10 classes (CIFAR 10) and 100 classes (CIFAR 100), with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images for each class configuration. The authors specify that they used this dataset in conjunction with wide residual networks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR 10/100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
