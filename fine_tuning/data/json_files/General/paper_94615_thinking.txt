To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Cross-modality Medical Image Segmentation with Online Mutual Knowledge Distillation" by Kang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "public multi-class cardiac segmentation data, i.e., MM-WHS 2017," indicating that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the dataset used for their evaluations. They specifically mention the **Multi-modality Whole Heart Segmentation Challenge 2017 (MM-WHS 2017)** dataset, which consists of unpaired MRI and CT volumes. The authors describe the dataset as containing 20 MRI and 20 CT volumes, along with annotations for 7 cardiac substructures.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MM-WHS 2017 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Zhuang, X., Li, L., Payer, C., Stern, D., Urschler, M., Heinrich, M. P., Oster, J., Wang, C., Smedby, O., Bian, C., et al. (2019). *Evaluation of algorithms for multi-modality whole heart segmentation: An open-access grand challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.07880.

Since the authors refer to the dataset in the context of their experiments, I will ensure to include this citation when documenting the dataset.

Now, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MM-WHS 2017 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information, including the name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
