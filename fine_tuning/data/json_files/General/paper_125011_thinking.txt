To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Recommender System Approach for Very Large-scale Multiobjective Optimization" by Haokai Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are referenced.

Then, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section typically outlines the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

Following this, I will check the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their method on the datasets. They may provide additional insights or metrics that could help in understanding the datasets better.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper mentions any specific datasets used for experiments, I will ensure to include those details accurately.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations for future reference.
