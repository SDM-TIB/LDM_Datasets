To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PILL: Plug Into LLM with Adapter Expert and Attention Gate" by Fangyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **CC595K**: This dataset consists of approximately 595,000 image-text pairs filtered from the CC3M dataset. It was created by extracting noun phrases from captions and selecting samples based on frequency criteria.

2. **ScienceQA**: This dataset contains 21,000 samples of multiple-choice questions with multimodal content, covering various subjects and topics. The authors utilized the training split of 12,726 samples for optimization and the test split of 4,241 samples for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **CC595K**, the citation is:
> Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Silvio Savarese, and Steven Hoi. *BLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-Training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models*. In ICML, 2023.

For **ScienceQA**, the citation is:
> Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tony Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan. *Learn to Explain: Multimodal Reasoning via Thought Chains for Science Question Answering*. In The 36th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2022.

With the dataset names and their respective citations in hand, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
