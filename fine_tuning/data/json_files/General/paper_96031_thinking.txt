To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Picking BERTâ€™s Brain: Probing for Linguistic Dependencies in Contextualized Embeddings Using Representational Similarity Analysis" by Michael A. Lepori and R. Thomas McCoy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on contextualized representations and their ability to encode linguistic dependencies, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are likely to be described. In **Experiment 1**, the authors mention creating a corpus of sentences for their analysis of verb embeddings. They specifically refer to two corpora: the **Prepositional Phrase Corpus** and the **Relative Clause Corpus**. 

1. **Prepositional Phrase Corpus**: This corpus contains sentences structured in a specific format, generated using a probabilistic context-free grammar. The authors state that they generated 2,000 sentences, ultimately retaining 1,863 valid sentences after removing duplicates and invalid sentences.

2. **Relative Clause Corpus**: Similar to the Prepositional Phrase Corpus, this corpus also uses a probabilistic context-free grammar to generate sentences. The final count of valid sentences in this corpus is 1,869.

In **Experiment 2**, the authors discuss another set of corpora focused on pronoun coreference, specifically the **Refl exive Corpus** and the **Pronominal Corpus**. 

3. **Refl exive Corpus**: This corpus consists of sentences that contain reflexive pronouns, yielding 1,828 valid sentences after filtering.

4. **Pronominal Corpus**: This corpus contains sentences with pronominal references, resulting in 1,826 valid sentences.

In **Experiment 3**, the authors create four additional corpora to study sentence heads:

5. **Intransitive Corpus**: Contains sentences structured to analyze intransitive verbs.

6. **Intransitive + Adjective Corpus**: Similar to the Intransitive Corpus but includes adjectives.

7. **Transitive Corpus**: Focuses on transitive verbs.

8. **Transitive + Adjective Corpus**: Combines transitive verbs with adjectives.

The authors mention generating 2,000 sentences for each of these corpora, with varying final counts after filtering.

Now, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets described in this paper are generated by the authors and do not have external citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Prepositional Phrase Corpus**: 1,863 valid sentences generated using a probabilistic context-free grammar.
2. **Relative Clause Corpus**: 1,869 valid sentences generated using a probabilistic context-free grammar.
3. **Refl exive Corpus**: 1,828 valid sentences generated for analyzing reflexive pronouns.
4. **Pronominal Corpus**: 1,826 valid sentences generated for analyzing pronominal references.
5. **Intransitive Corpus**: 200 sentences generated for intransitive verbs.
6. **Intransitive + Adjective Corpus**: 1,273 sentences generated for intransitive verbs with adjectives.
7. **Transitive Corpus**: 1,572 sentences generated for transitive verbs.
8. **Transitive + Adjective Corpus**: 1,995 sentences generated for transitive verbs with adjectives.

Since these datasets are original to the authors and do not have external citations, I will note that they are described in the paper without specific references to external sources. 

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
