To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Empirical Evaluation of Parallel Training Algorithms on Acoustic Modeling" by Wenpeng Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments using the **1000-hour LibriSpeech corpus**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention that they trained their models on the **1000-hour LibriSpeech dataset**. I will need to confirm the details of this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the training setup and confirm that the **LibriSpeech corpus** was used for training deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional long short-term memory networks (CLDNNs). They mention that the dataset includes 40-dimensional FBANK features and is used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **LibriSpeech corpus**, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
