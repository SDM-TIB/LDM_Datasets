To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Class Gaussian Process Classification Made Conjugate" by ThÃ©o Galy-Fajou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using datasets from the **LIBSVM repository** for their experiments. This indicates that multiple datasets were utilized, but I need to identify the specific datasets referenced.

In the experiments section, the authors list five datasets used for evaluation:
1. **Combined**: 98,528 points, 50 features, 3 classes.
2. **CovType**: 581,000 points, 54 features, 7 classes.
3. **Fashion-MNIST**: 70,000 points, 784 features, 10 classes.
4. **MNIST**: 70,000 points, 784 features, 10 classes.
5. **Shuttle**: 58,000 points, 9 features, 7 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are well-known and publicly available, they may not have specific citations in the paper. Instead, I will provide general references for the datasets based on their common sources.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:
- **Combined**: This dataset is typically derived from various sources and may not have a specific citation.
- **CovType**: 
  > Blackard, J. A., & Dean, D. J. (1999). "Comparing Neural Networks to Regression Models for Predicting Forest Cover Types." *Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks*.
- **Fashion-MNIST**: 
  > Xiao, H., Rashtchian, C., & Zhang, Y. (2017). "Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*.
- **MNIST**: 
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., & Burges, C. J. (1998). "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits." *http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/*.
- **Shuttle**: 
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2019). "UCI Machine Learning Repository." *http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/shuttle*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
