To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Adaptive Activation Function" by Kyungsu Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may mention datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of specific datasets or benchmarks.

In the **methodology** section, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used, including any specific characteristics or configurations. I will look for sections titled "Datasets," "Experimental Setup," or similar.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to confirm that the datasets mentioned earlier were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the study.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile a list of datasets, ensuring to include the following details for each:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the study.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as it appears in the references section of the paper.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview that includes proper citations.
