To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models" by Mengzhou Xia, Zexuan Zhong, and Danqi Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on the **GLUE** and **SQuAD** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using the **GLUE** benchmark and the **SQuAD v1.1** dataset for their experiments. I will note down the specific tasks associated with the GLUE benchmark, which includes SST-2, MNLI, QQP, QNLI, MRPC, CoLA, STS-B, and RTE.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of each dataset. The paper provides a brief overview of the datasets used:

1. **GLUE**: A multi-task benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding systems. It includes several tasks:
   - **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset.
   - **MNLI**: A multi-genre natural language inference dataset.
   - **QQP**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
   - **QNLI**: A question-answering dataset derived from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).
   - **MRPC**: A dataset for paraphrase identification in sentences.
   - **CoLA**: A dataset for linguistic acceptability judgments.
   - **STS-B**: A dataset for semantic textual similarity.
   - **RTE**: A dataset for recognizing textual entailment.

2. **SQuAD v1.1**: A reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed on a set of Wikipedia articles.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **GLUE**:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R Bowman. *GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

- For **SQuAD v1.1**:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
