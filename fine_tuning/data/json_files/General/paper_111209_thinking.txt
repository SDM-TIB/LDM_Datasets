To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Testing in High-Dimensional Sparse Models" by Anand Jerry George and Cl√©ment L. Canonne, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses robust testing under different observation models, but it does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss experiments or empirical evaluations. I will focus on any sections that might detail the datasets used for testing the hypotheses or models proposed by the authors.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the context of their work but do not specify datasets. I will then look for sections that might detail the experimental setup or data collection methods.

If there are sections labeled as **"Experiments" or "Results,"** I will pay close attention to these, as they are likely to contain information about the datasets used. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source online to ensure I have the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
