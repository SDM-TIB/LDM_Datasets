To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Global Fairness Verification of Tree-Based Classifiers" by Stefano Calzavara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that "experimental results on public datasets show that the analysis is precise," which indicates that datasets are used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss their experimental evaluation. Here, they mention using three public datasets: **Adult**, **German**, and **Health**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the number of features, instances, and any specific characteristics that are relevant.

In the **table provided in Section IV**, the authors summarize the statistics for each dataset, which includes:
- **Adult Dataset**: Contains 45,222 instances with 6 numerical features and 7 categorical features.
- **German Dataset**: Contains 1,000 instances with 7 numerical features and 13 categorical features.
- **Health Dataset**: Contains 166,842 instances with 93 numerical features and 2 categorical features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Adult Dataset**: 
  > D. J. H. K. (1996). *Adult dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- **German Dataset**: 
  > H. Hofmann, M. (1998). *German credit dataset*. UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

- **Health Dataset**: 
  > Z. Obermeyer, S. Mullainathan. (2019). *Health dataset*. Kaggle. Available: https://www.kaggle.com/c/hhp

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing the necessary citations for further reference.
