To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Perspective on Multi-Domain and Multi-Task Learning" by Yongxin Yang and Timothy M. Hospedales, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the **Office Dataset** as an example of a multi-domain learning scenario. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe several datasets used in their experiments:

1. **School Dataset**: This dataset collects exam grades of 15,362 students from 139 schools, with 23 features used to predict students' grades. The dataset is significant for multi-domain and zero-shot domain adaptation tasks.

2. **Audio Recognition Dataset**: This dataset is used for music-speech discrimination tasks and includes 64 music and speech tracks. It is relevant for exploring the effects of different acoustic environments and microphone types.

3. **Animal with Attributes Dataset**: This dataset includes images from 50 animal categories, each with an 85-dimensional binary attribute vector. It is used for multi-task learning and zero-shot learning experiments.

4. **Restaurant & Consumer Dataset**: This dataset contains 1161 customer-to-restaurant scoring records, with 43 features and three scores (food, service, overall). It is used for multi-domain multi-task learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. Here are the citations for the datasets mentioned:

- **Office Dataset**:

  > Vargas-Govea, B., González-Serna, G., & Ponce-Medellín, R. (2011). *Effects of relevant contextual features in the performance of a restaurant recommender system*. In Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
