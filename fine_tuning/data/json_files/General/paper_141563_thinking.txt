To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Interpretable Client Decision Tree Aggregation Process for Federated Learning" by Alberto Argente-Garrido et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using four datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Framework)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list four classification datasets: **Nursery, Adult, Car, and Credit**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including the type of data, number of instances, features, and classes.

The paper provides a summary table (Table 1) that includes the following information:

1. **Nursery**: 
   - Dataset type: Categorical
   - Instances: 12,960
   - Features: 8
   - Classes: 5

2. **Adult**: 
   - Dataset type: Numerical and Categorical
   - Instances: 48,842
   - Features: 14
   - Classes: 2

3. **Car**: 
   - Dataset type: Categorical
   - Instances: 1,728
   - Features: 6
   - Classes: 4

4. **Credit**: 
   - Dataset type: Numerical
   - Instances: 30,000
   - Features: 24
   - Classes: 2

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but I can look up the datasets online to find their original sources.

For example, I can find the following citations:

- **Nursery Dataset**: 
  > "Nursery Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/nursery.

- **Adult Dataset**: 
  > "Adult Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult.

- **Car Evaluation Dataset**: 
  > "Car Evaluation Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation.

- **Credit Card Default Dataset**: 
  > "Credit Card Default Dataset." UCI Machine Learning Repository. Available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
