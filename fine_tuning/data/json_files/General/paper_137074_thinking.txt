To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Model Capabilities in Perioperative Risk Prediction and Prognostication" by Philip Chung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the performance of large language models on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Study Cohort and Dataset Definition**. Here, the authors describe the inclusion criteria for patients and the process of dataset creation. They mention that seven datasets were created for different prediction tasks, which is crucial information.

I will list the datasets as follows:

1. **ASA Physical Status Classification Dataset**: This dataset is constructed to predict the ASA Physical Status Classification based on patient clinical notes and procedure descriptions.

2. **PACU Phase 1 Duration Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict the duration of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) based on various clinical factors.

3. **Hospital Admission Dataset**: This dataset is designed to predict whether a patient will be admitted to the hospital post-surgery.

4. **Hospital Duration Dataset**: This dataset predicts the length of hospital stay for patients after surgery.

5. **ICU Admission & ICU Duration Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting both ICU admission and the duration of stay in the ICU.

6. **Unplanned Admission Dataset**: This dataset predicts whether a patient will have an unplanned admission after surgery.

7. **Hospital Mortality Dataset**: This dataset is focused on predicting the likelihood of hospital mortality for patients undergoing surgery.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are derived from the authors' own research and not external sources, I will note that the citations may not be available in the traditional sense.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions of each dataset along with any relevant details about their creation and intended use.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, ready for further analysis or documentation.
