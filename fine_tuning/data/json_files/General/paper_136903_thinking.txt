To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Learning Multi-axis Representation in Frequency Domain for Medical Image Segmentation" by Jiacheng Ruan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on **four datasets**, which suggests that I should look for their names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **ISIC17 Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,150 dermoscopy images with ground truth for skin lesion segmentation. The authors reference the original source as:
   > Berseth, M. (2017). *ISIC 2017 - Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:170300523.

2. **ISIC18 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,694 dermoscopy images with ground truth, also for skin lesion segmentation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Codella, N., Rotemberg, V., Tschandl, P., et al. (2019). *Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:190203368.

3. **Synapse Dataset**: A public multi-organ segmentation dataset that includes 30 abdominal CT cases. The citation is:
   > Landman, B., Xu, Z., Iglesias, J., et al. (2015). *MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge*. In Proc. MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond Cranial Vault—Workshop Challenge, p. 12.

4. **ACDC Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 MRI scans for cardiac segmentation. The citation is:
   > Bernard, O., Lalande, A., Zotti, C., et al. (2018). *Deep Learning Techniques for Automatic MRI Cardiac Multi-Structures Segmentation and Diagnosis: Is the Problem Solved?* IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 37(11), 2514–2525.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately noted the details and citations for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
