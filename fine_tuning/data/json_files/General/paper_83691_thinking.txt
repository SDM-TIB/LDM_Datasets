To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Novel Uncertainty Framework for Deep Learning Ensembles" by Tal Kachman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their algorithm on "publicly available benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset that serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, consisting of fashion items instead of digits.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. The MNIST database of handwritten digits. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation to ensure clarity and completeness.
