To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Keyphrase Generation" by Krishna Garg, Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, and Cornelia Caragea, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (section 4.1), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **LDKP3K**: This dataset contains computer science research articles from online digital libraries and is a subset of the KP20K corpus. It includes full text instead of just titles and abstracts.

2. **LDKP10K**: This dataset expands a subset of articles from the OAGkx dataset to include their full text. It consists of scientific publications curated from various domains.

3. **KPTimes**: A large-scale dataset with long news texts, which is used to mimic keyphrase generation datasets from a different domain.

In the **statistics table (Table 2)**, the authors provide detailed statistics about each dataset, including the number of training, development, and test samples, as well as average words and keyphrases.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LDKP3K**, the citation is:
  > Debanjan Mahata, Naveen Agarwal, Dibya Gautam, Amardeep Kumar, Swapnil Parekh, Yaman Kumar Singla, Anish Acharya, and Rajiv Ratn Shah. *LDKP - A Dataset for Identifying Keyphrases from Long Scientific Documents*. In DL4SR-22: Workshop on Deep Learning for Search and Recommendation, co-located with the 31st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), 2022.

- For **LDKP10K**, the citation is the same as LDKP3K since it is an expansion of the dataset:
  > Debanjan Mahata, Naveen Agarwal, Dibya Gautam, Amardeep Kumar, Swapnil Parekh, Yaman Kumar Singla, Anish Acharya, and Rajiv Ratn Shah. *LDKP - A Dataset for Identifying Keyphrases from Long Scientific Documents*. In DL4SR-22: Workshop on Deep Learning for Search and Recommendation, co-located with the 31st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), 2022.

- For **KPTimes**, the citation is:
  > Ygor Gallina, Florian Boudin, and Beatrice Daille. *KPTimes: A Large-Scale Dataset for Keyphrase Generation on News Documents*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Natural Language Generation, pages 130â€“135, Tokyo, Japan, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
