To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Intelligent Millimeter and Terahertz Communication for 6G: Computer Vision-aided Beamforming" by Yongjun Ahn et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a specially designed dataset called **Vision Objects for Beam Management (VOBEM)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this case, **section IV (Experiments and Discussions)** provides a comprehensive description of the VOBEM dataset. The authors state that the VOBEM dataset consists of 135 pairs of RGB and depth images acquired from 21 distinct environments, with annotations for class (human or mobile phone), distance, angle, and bounding boxes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VOBEM dataset. However, since this dataset is newly generated by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Vision Objects for Beam Management (VOBEM)**: This dataset is specifically designed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed computer vision-aided beam management framework. It includes 135 pairs of RGB and depth images, labeled with categories (person or mobile) and bounding boxes of the objects. The images are collected from various environments, including classrooms and hallways.

Since the VOBEM dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will ensure to include its details and the context in which it was used for the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to highlight the importance of the dataset in the context of the research and its unique characteristics, while also noting that it is described in detail within the paper itself.
