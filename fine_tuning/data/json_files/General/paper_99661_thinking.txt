To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-source Neural Topic Modeling in Multi-view Embedding Spaces" by Pankaj Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets in both the target and source domains. I will look for a dedicated section or table that lists these datasets along with their descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that **Table 3** provides a detailed description of the datasets used in the experiments. The datasets listed include:

1. **20NSshort**: A subset of the 20NewsGroups dataset, consisting of documents with fewer than 20 words.
2. **20NSsmall**: A small corpus sampled from the 20NewsGroups dataset, with longer documents.
3. **TMNtitle**: Titles from the Tag My News dataset.
4. **R21578title**: Titles from the Reuters corpus.
5. **Ohsumedtitle**: Titles from the Ohsumed dataset.
6. **Ohsumed**: A collection of medical abstracts from the Ohsumed dataset.
7. **TMN**: The Tag My News dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **20NewsGroups**: 
  > Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning* (ICML), pages 331-339.

- **Tag My News (TMN)**: 
  > Moschitti, A. (2006). *Tag My News Dataset*. Available at: http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm.

- **Reuters (R21578)**: 
  > Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T., & Li, F. (2004). RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 5, 361-397.

- **Ohsumed**: 
  > Hersh, W., & Hickam, D. (1998). Ohsumed: An interactive retrieval evaluation. *Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, pages 1-8.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **20NSshort**: A subset of the 20NewsGroups dataset.
   - Citation: Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning* (ICML), pages 331-339.

2. **20NSsmall**: A small corpus from the 20NewsGroups dataset.
   - Citation: Lang, K. (1995). Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews. In *Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning* (ICML), pages 331-339.

3. **TMNtitle**: Titles from the Tag My News dataset.
   - Citation: Moschitti, A. (2006). *Tag My News Dataset*. Available at: http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm.

4. **R21578title**: Titles from the Reuters corpus.
   - Citation: Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T., & Li, F. (2004). RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 5, 361-397.

5. **Ohsumedtitle**: Titles from the Ohsumed dataset.
   - Citation: Hersh, W., & Hickam, D. (1998). Ohsumed: An interactive retrieval evaluation. *Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, pages 1-8.

6. **Ohsumed**: A collection of medical abstracts from the Ohsumed dataset.
   - Citation: Hersh, W., & Hickam, D. (1998). Ohsumed: An interactive retrieval evaluation. *Proceedings of the 1998 ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval*, pages 1-8.

7. **TMN**: The Tag My News dataset.
   - Citation: Moschitti, A. (2006). *Tag My News Dataset*. Available at: http://disi.unitn.it/moschitti/corpora.htm.

With this information compiled, I am ready to present the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
