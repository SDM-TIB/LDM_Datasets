To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection with Batch Normalization" by Jiaming Song, Yang Song, and Stefano Ermon, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors may also describe how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets or their properties. For instance, if there is a table listing the datasets along with their descriptions or performance metrics, I will extract that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to note down the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Based on the content of the paper, I expect to find at least the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains images of house numbers collected from Google Street View.
3. **Fashion MNIST**: A dataset of Zalando's article images, intended as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset.

I will compile the full citations for these datasets as follows:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. 2011.

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by other researchers.
