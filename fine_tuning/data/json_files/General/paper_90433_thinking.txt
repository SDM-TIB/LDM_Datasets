To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NBDT: Neural-Backed Decision Tree" by Alvin Wan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that their method outperforms modern neural networks on datasets like CIFAR, ImageNet, and TinyImageNet. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, specifically **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each class having 500 training images.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories, widely used for image classification tasks.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2015.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and can be referenced appropriately in future work.
