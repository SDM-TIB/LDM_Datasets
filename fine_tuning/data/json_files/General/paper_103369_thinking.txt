To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parsing Table Structures in the Wild" by Rujiao Long et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a large-scale dataset called **Wired Table in the Wild (WTW)**, which is a strong indicator that this is a primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The WTW Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as containing **14,581 images** with annotations for table structures, including cell coordinates and row/column information. This section will provide the necessary details about the dataset's content and structure.

In addition to the WTW dataset, I will check the **Related Work** section to identify any other datasets mentioned. The authors reference several existing datasets, including **UNLV**, **ICDAR-2013**, **TableBank**, **PubTabNet**, and **SciTSR**. I will note these datasets as they may be relevant for context or comparison.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The citations can typically be found in the **References section**. Here’s what I will look for:

1. **Wired Table in the Wild (WTW)**: Since this is the primary dataset introduced in the paper, I will note that it is created by the authors themselves. The citation will be:
   > Rujiao Long, Wen Wang, Nan Xue, Feiyu Gao, Zhibo Yang, Yongpan Wang, Gui-Song Xia. *Parsing Table Structures in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2023.

2. **UNLV Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Asif Shahab, Faisal Shafait, Thomas Kieninger, and Andreas Dengel. *An open approach towards the benchmarking of table structure recognition systems*. In Proceedings of the 9th IAPR International Workshop on Document Analysis Systems, pages 113–120, 2010.

3. **ICDAR-2013 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Max Göbel, Tamir Hassan, Ermelinda Oro, and Giorgio Orsi. *Icdar 2013 table competition*. In 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1449–1453. IEEE, 2013.

4. **TableBank Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Minghao Li, Lei Cui, Shaohan Huang, Furu Wei, Ming Zhou, and Zhoujun Li. *Tablebank: A benchmark dataset for table detection and recognition*. arXiv e-prints, pages arXiv–1903, 2019.

5. **PubTabNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zewen Chi, Heyan Huang, Heng-Da Xu, Houjin Yu, Wanxuan Yin, and Xian-Ling Mao. *Complicated table structure recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.04729, 2019.

6. **SciTSR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Xinyi Zheng, Douglas Burdick, Lucian Popa, Xu Zhong, and Nancy Xin Ru Wang. *Global table extractor (gte): A framework for joint table identification and cell structure recognition using visual context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 697–706, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or research.
