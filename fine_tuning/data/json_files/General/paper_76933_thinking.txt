To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Determinantal Point Processes for Coresets" by Nicolas Tremblay, Simon Barthelm√©, and Pierre-Olivier Amblard, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Applications."** In this paper, the authors discuss various applications, including k-means and linear regression, which may involve specific datasets.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments. For instance, the paper mentions using the MNIST dataset and the US Census dataset, which are both well-known datasets in machine learning.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- For the MNIST dataset, I would find the citation that includes the authors, title, and publication details.
- For the US Census dataset, I will ensure to note the source and any relevant publication information.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete. Finally, I will review the extracted information to confirm its accuracy before finalizing the dataset entries.
