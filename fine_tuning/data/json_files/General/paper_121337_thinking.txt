To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Getting Away with More Network Pruning: From Sparsity to Geometry and Linear Regions" by Junyang Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 6 (Computational Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 images of clothing items, serving as a more challenging alternative to MNIST.
3. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 images across 10 different classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.
4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, providing a more granular classification challenge.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
