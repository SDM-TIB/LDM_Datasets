To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Classical integrability in the presence of a cosmological constant: analytic and machine learning results" by Gabriel Lopes Cardoso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, results, or data analysis. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

I will also pay attention to any **figures, tables, or appendices** that might contain additional information about datasets. Sometimes datasets are summarized in tables or referenced in figures, which can provide insights into their structure and content.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant details such as volume, page numbers, and year of publication.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the "AdS4 solution dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly available, I will search for it in the literature to ensure I provide accurate and complete information.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me create a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the paper, which can be useful for future research or replication studies.

Finally, I will summarize my findings in a clear and organized manner, making sure to highlight the significance of each dataset in the context of the research conducted in the paper.
