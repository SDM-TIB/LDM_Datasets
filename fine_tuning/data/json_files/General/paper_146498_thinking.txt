To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Vision and Language Pretraining with Large-Scale Synthetic Data" by Dejie Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of **SynVL3D**, a synthetic dataset with 10K indoor scenes and 1M descriptions, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **Datasets** or **Methodology** sections. In this paper, the authors describe **SynVL3D** in detail, highlighting its advantages over existing datasets. They mention that it includes diverse scene data, rich textual descriptions, and fine-grained associations, which confirms its significance.

I will also check the **Related Work** section to identify any other datasets that the authors compare against. The paper references several existing datasets, including:

1. **ScanRefer**: A dataset for 3D object localization in RGB-D scans using natural language.
2. **Nr3D**: A dataset for fine-grained 3D object identification.
3. **ScanQA**: A dataset for 3D question answering.
4. **ScanScribe**: A large-scale dataset combining multiple existing 3D datasets.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **ScanRefer**:

- For **Nr3D**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
