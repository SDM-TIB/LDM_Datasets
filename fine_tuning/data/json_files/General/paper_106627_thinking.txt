To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Informative Surgical Skill Assessment with Gaussian Process Learning" by Yangming Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a novel method for surgical skill assessment, but it does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Relative Motion Based Gaussian Process Learning for Automatic Objective Surgical Skill Assessment)**, particularly the **Data Acquisition subsection**. Here, the authors mention that they used **commercial surgical navigation systems** for data collection, specifically the **Medtronic StealthStation® S7® surgical navigation system**. This indicates that the data used for their experiments is derived from this system, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are referenced.

In the **Experimental Setup section**, the authors describe the experiments conducted on cadaver heads, where eight surgeons performed various procedures. They mention that the data collected includes motion data from the surgical navigation system, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. Instead, they refer to the data as being collected from cadaver experiments, which suggests that the dataset is not publicly available or named.

I will also check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to datasets or data collection methods. However, the references primarily focus on related works and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names for any datasets, I will summarize the data source as follows:

1. **Surgical Motion Data**: Collected using the Medtronic StealthStation® S7® surgical navigation system during cadaver experiments involving endoscopic sinus and skull base surgeries. The data includes kinematic features of surgical instrument movements.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the Medtronic system as it is a critical component of the data collection process.

The citation for the Medtronic StealthStation® S7® surgical navigation system is:
> Medtronic. *StealthStation® S7® Surgical Navigation System*. Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA.

Since there are no other datasets explicitly named in the paper, I will conclude my extraction process here. The focus will be on the surgical motion data collected from the cadaver experiments using the specified navigation system.
