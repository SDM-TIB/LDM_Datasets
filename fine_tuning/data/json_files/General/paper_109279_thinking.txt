To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "What’s in the Black Box? The False Negative Mechanisms Inside Object Detectors" by Dimity Miller et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on false negatives in object detection, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section V (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The authors specify that they evaluate using the 'val2017' split, which contains 4952 images featuring objects from 80 different target classes.

2. **Exclusively Dark (ExDark) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7363 images from low-light environments, with various target object classes.

3. **iCubWorld Transformation (iCubWorldT) Dataset**: This dataset includes 2400 images collected by an iCub humanoid robot, featuring objects from challenging viewpoints.

4. **CSIRO Data61 Subterranean Robot Dataset**: This dataset contains 5384 images collected during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, with hand-labeled annotations for various target objects.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

- For the **Exclusively Dark (ExDark) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. P. Loh and C. S. Chan. *Getting to Know Low-Light Images with the Exclusively Dark Dataset*. Computer Vision and Image Understanding, vol. 178, pp. 30–42, 2019.

- For the **iCubWorld Transformation (iCubWorldT) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Pasquale, C. Ciliberto, F. Odone, L. Rosasco, and L. Natale. *Are We Done with Object Recognition? The iCub Robot’s Perspective*. Robotics and Autonomous Systems, vol. 112, pp. 260–281, 2019.

- For the **CSIRO Data61 Subterranean Robot Dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. H. et al. *Heterogeneous Ground and Air Platforms, Homogeneous Sensing: Team CSIRO Data61’s Approach to the DARPA Subterranean Challenge*, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
