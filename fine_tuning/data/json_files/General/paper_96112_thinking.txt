To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoding Syntactic Constituency Paths for Frame-Semantic Parsing with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Emanuele Bastianelli, Andrea Vanzo, and Oliver Lemon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their approach on **FrameNet 1.5** and **CoNLL-2005**, which suggests these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup and results. They explicitly mention using **FrameNet 1.5** and **CoNLL-2005** for their evaluations. 

1. **FrameNet 1.5**: The authors state that they validated their constituency path features on this dataset, which is a well-known resource for frame-semantic parsing. They refer to the original paper for this dataset, which is crucial for citation.

2. **CoNLL-2005**: Similarly, the authors mention using this dataset to verify the generality of their approach. They also provide a reference to the original work related to this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FrameNet 1.5**, the citation is:
  > Collin F. Baker, Charles J. Fillmore, and John B. Lowe. *The Berkeley FrameNet project*. In 36th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and 17th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Volume 1, pages 86–90, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Association for Computational Linguistics, 1998.

- For **CoNLL-2005**, the citation is:
  > Xavier Carreras and Lluís M`arquez. *Introduction to the CoNLL-2005 shared task: Semantic role labeling*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL-2005), pages 152–164, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2005.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets:

1. **FrameNet 1.5**: A dataset used for frame-semantic parsing, providing annotated examples of semantic frames.
2. **CoNLL-2005**: A dataset used for semantic role labeling, containing annotated sentences for training and evaluation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is captured for future reference or processing.
