To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Power Allocation for Minimizing AoI and Energy Consumption in MIMO-NOMA IoT Systems" by Hongbiao Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section IV (DRL Method for Optimization of Power Allocation)** and **section V (Simulation Results and Analysis)**. These sections often detail the experimental setup and may explicitly mention datasets used for training and testing the proposed methods.

In section V, the authors describe the simulation scenarios and parameters, but they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they discuss the simulation parameters and the environment set up for their experiments. This suggests that the authors may have created their own synthetic datasets for the simulations rather than using established datasets.

Since no specific datasets are cited in the paper, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the study. However, it appears that the references primarily focus on related works and methodologies rather than datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no explicit datasets mentioned that can be cited. The authors rely on simulations based on their own models rather than established datasets.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:

1. **No explicit datasets were mentioned in the paper.**
2. **The authors conducted simulations based on their own models.**
3. **No citations for datasets can be provided.**

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any potential datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable. Since there are no datasets to cite, I will note that in my final output.
