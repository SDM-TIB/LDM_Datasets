To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Volumetric Lung Nodule Segmentation using Adaptive ROI with Multi-view Residual Learning" by Muhammad Usman et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on the **LIDC-IDRI dataset**, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors describe the **LIDC-IDRI dataset** in detail, stating that it is the largest publicly available dataset for lung nodule detection and segmentation. They mention that it consists of 1,018 cases of diagnostic and lung cancer screening thoracic CT scans with annotated lesions.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> S. G. Armato III, G. McLennan, L. Bidaut, M. F. McNitt-Gray, C. R. Meyer, A. P. Reeves, B. Zhao, D. R. Aberle, C. I. Henschke, E. A. Hoffman et al., “The lung image database consortium (lidc) and image database resource initiative (idri): a completed reference database of lung nodules on ct scans,” Medical physics, vol. 38, no. 2, pp. 915–931, 2011.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **LIDC-IDRI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed segmentation method. It contains 1,018 cases of thoracic CT scans with annotated lesions, specifically focusing on lung nodules.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
