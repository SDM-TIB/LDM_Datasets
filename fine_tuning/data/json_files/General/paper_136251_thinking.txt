To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SM70: A Large Language Model for Medical Devices" by Anubhav Bhatti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used around 800K data entries from the publicly available dataset **MedAlpaca** for fine-tuning their model. This is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly **section 2.2 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their work. Here, I will look for specific names and descriptions of each dataset mentioned.

The following datasets are explicitly listed in the paper:

1. **Medical Meadow Dataset**: This dataset is the primary dataset used for fine-tuning and contains approximately 800,000 data entries. It is a collection of various medical texts.

2. **MEDIQA**: A dataset of manually generated, question-driven summaries of answers to consumer health questions. 

3. **MMMLU**: A dataset that evaluates language models' performance across a wide range of tasks, focusing on language understanding.

4. **Anki Flashcards**: A collection of medical curriculum flashcards created by medical students, covering various topics in medicine.

5. **Wikidoc Patient Information**: A dataset of medical question-answer pairs extracted from WikiDoc, structured with questions as section headings.

6. **Wikidoc Living Textbook**: A dataset containing chapters for various medical specialties, rephrased into question-answer format.

7. **Pubmed Causal**: A dataset designed to study causal language in scientific texts, particularly in health and medicine.

8. **MEDQA**: A dataset specifically for evaluating natural language processing models in the medical domain, focusing on medical question answering.

9. **Pubmed Health Advice**: A dataset for analyzing the use of causal language in scientific texts.

10. **CORD-19**: A resource of over 1,000,000 scholarly articles related to COVID-19 and related coronaviruses.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
