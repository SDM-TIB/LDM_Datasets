To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Distillation for Improved Accuracy in Spoken Question Answering" by Chenyu You et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the **Spoken-SQuAD dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe the challenges in spoken question answering and mention the **Spoken-SQuAD** dataset as one of the few available datasets for this task. This section provides context for the dataset's relevance.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide detailed information about the **Spoken-SQuAD dataset**. They state that it contains 37,111 question pairs in the training set and 5,351 in the testing set, with a word error rate (WER) of 22.77% on the training set and 22.73% on the testing set. This confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors reference the **Text-SQuAD dataset** as the source of the reference written documents for the Spoken-SQuAD dataset. They mention that Text-SQuAD includes 536 articles from Wikipedia and 107,785 question-answer pairs, which is also crucial for understanding the context of their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **Spoken-SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chia-Hsuan Li, Szu-Lin Wu, Chi-Liang Liu, and Hung-yi Lee. *Spoken SQuAD: A study of mitigating the impact of speech recognition errors on listening comprehension*. In 2018 IEEE Spoken Language Technology Workshop (SLT), pages 949–956, 2018.

2. For the **Text-SQuAD dataset**, the citation is:
   > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383–2392, 2016.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
