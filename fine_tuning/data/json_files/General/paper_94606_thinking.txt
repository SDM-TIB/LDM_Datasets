To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Revisiting Batch Normalization for Training Low-latency Deep Spiking Neural Networks from Scratch" by Youngeun Kim and Priyadarshini Panda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images (50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing) across 10 categories. Each image is an RGB color image with a size of 32 × 32 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 60,000 images but spans 100 categories, maintaining the same configuration as CIFAR-10.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset is a modified subset of the original ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 100,000 training images and 10,000 validation images. The resolution of the images is 64 × 64 pixels.

4. **DVS-CIFAR10**: This dataset has the same configuration as CIFAR-10 but is collected using an event-driven camera, making it suitable for neuromorphic applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **DVS-CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Hongmin Li, Hanchao Liu, Xiangyang Ji, Guoqi Li, and Luping Shi. *Cifar10-dvs: an event-stream dataset for object classification*. Frontiers in neuroscience, 11:309, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative for future reference or processing.
