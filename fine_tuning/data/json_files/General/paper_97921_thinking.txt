To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lenient Regret and Good-Action Identification in Gaussian Process Bandits" by Xu Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the experimental context, which can lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names or references to datasets, as well as any descriptions that provide context about their content, size, and purpose.

In this paper, the authors discuss various experiments, including those involving synthetic and non-synthetic functions. I will pay attention to any datasets mentioned in the context of these experiments. For example, they reference the **Boston housing dataset** for hyperparameter tuning in XGBoost, which is a well-known dataset in machine learning.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For the **Boston housing dataset**, the citation is:
> Chen, T. and Guestrin, C. (2016). XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system. In ACM SIGKDD Int. Conf. Knowl. Disc. Data Mining, pp. 785â€“794.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned, such as those used in synthetic experiments or any specific datasets referenced in the context of the robot pushing tasks.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
