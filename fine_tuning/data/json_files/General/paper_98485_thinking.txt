To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perception Framework through Real-Time Semantic Segmentation and Scene Recognition on a Wearable System for the Visually Impaired" by Yingzhi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors verified their system's accuracy and efficiency on both public datasets and real-world scenes, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their model. In this section, they state that they trained their model on the **ADE20k dataset**. The authors provide a brief description of this dataset, noting that it contains 20,210 training images fully annotated with object and scene labels, along with 2,000 validation images. They also mention the number of object categories (150) and scene categories (1,055), which is important for understanding the dataset's scope.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ADE20k dataset. The citation is as follows:
> B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2017, 2017.

Since the paper does not mention any other specific datasets, I will compile the information about the ADE20k dataset into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the ADE20k dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any further processing or review.
