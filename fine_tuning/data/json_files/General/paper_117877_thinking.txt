To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Granger Causality for Predictability in Dynamic Mode Decomposition" by G. Revati et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of measurement data sequences for validating the DMD algorithm, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly where the authors discuss the application of their methodology. They mention a **22 bus 6 generator system** as a case study, which indicates that this system's data is likely a dataset used in their experiments.

In the **data selection subsection**, the authors explicitly state that the measurement data is gathered from **Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs)** installed in the power system network. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

The authors also reference a specific source for the dataset: they mention that the data is obtained from a previous work by Wagh et al. (2009). I will need to locate this reference in the **References section** to provide the full citation.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset**: Measurement data from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for the 22 bus 6 generator system.
   - **Full Citation**: 
     > S. R. Wagh, A. Kamath, and N. Singh. *Non-linear model predictive control for improving transient stability of power system using TCSC controller*. In 2009 7th Asian Control Conference. IEEE, 2009, pp. 1627â€“1632.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately represented the dataset and its citation. This will allow me to create a structured output that can be used for further analysis or integration into a database.
