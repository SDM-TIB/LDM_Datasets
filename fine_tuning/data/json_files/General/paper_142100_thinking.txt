To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bootstrapping Linear Models for Fast Online Adaptation in Human-Agent Collaboration" by Benjamin A. Newman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify their names and purposes.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets they used. In this section, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how these datasets were generated or collected.

From my reading of section 4.1, I note that the authors mention three datasets related to user preferences and collaborative demonstrations in a simulated surface rearrangement task:

1. **D_train**: This dataset consists of 1000 simulated preferences, each with 1000 episodes of surface rearrangement tasks.
2. **D_eval**: This dataset contains 100 simulated preferences, with 20 episodes per preference.
3. **D_test**: Similar to D_eval, this dataset also includes 100 simulated preferences, with 20 episodes per preference.

In addition, the authors describe the environments used for testing, which are categorized into small, medium, and large environments based on the number of objects and locations involved in the tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets are simulated and generated by the authors, so they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note that these datasets are part of the authors' experimental setup and do not have traditional citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the names and descriptions as outlined in the paper. Since these datasets are created for the study, I will indicate that they are original datasets developed by the authors.

After compiling this information, I will be ready to present the dataset entries in a structured format for further use or analysis.
