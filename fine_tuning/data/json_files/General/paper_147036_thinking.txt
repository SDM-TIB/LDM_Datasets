To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sharif-STR at SemEval-2024 Task 1: Transformer as a Regression Model for Fine-Grained Scoring of Textual Semantic Relations" by Seyedeh Fatemeh Ebrahimi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset overview sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on sentence-level Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) and mentions the use of datasets provided by Ousidhoum et al. (2024a). This suggests that there are specific datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 2.1 (Dataset Overview)**, where the authors describe the SemEval-2024 Task 1 dataset. They mention that this dataset includes training, development, and test sets across 14 languages, with each set comprising sentence pairs annotated with semantic relatedness scores. This section provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3.2 (Resources)**, the authors explicitly state that they relied on the dataset provided for SemEval-2024 Task 1 (Ousidhoum et al., 2024a) for training their model. This confirms that this dataset is central to their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work section** or throughout the paper. The authors reference previous works that contributed to the development of STR datasets, particularly those by Abdalla et al. (2021) and Ousidhoum et al. (2024a). However, the primary dataset used for their experiments is the one from Ousidhoum et al. (2024a).

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SemEval-2024 Task 1 Dataset**:

2. **First Sentence-Level STR Datasets** (referenced):
   > Mohamed Abdalla, Krishnapriya Vishnubhotla, and Saif M. Mohammad. 2021. *What makes sentences semantically related? a textual relatedness dataset and empirical study*. ArXiv, abs/2110.04845.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and ensure that the datasets are properly credited in any subsequent analysis or application of the research findings.
