To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptation of Domain-Specific Transformer Models with Text Oversampling for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts on COVID-19 Vaccines" by Anmol Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors fine-tune transformer models on tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, suggesting that a dataset of tweets is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges of analyzing sentiments from social media posts. They mention the use of a small sample dataset containing tweets on COVID-19 vaccine discussions, which is a strong indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide details about the dataset they used. They mention that the dataset is a small subset of annotated COVID-19 tweets presented by Gabriel Preda, which contains 6000 tweets with sentiment labels (positive, negative, and neutral). This section provides crucial information about the dataset's size and structure.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm the dataset's characteristics and how it was used in the experiments. The authors describe the dataset's imbalance, with 3680 neutral tweets, 1900 positive tweets, and 420 negative tweets, which aligns with their analysis of sentiment classification.

Finally, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
- Gabriel Preda. *All COVID-19 Vaccines Tweets*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets. Last accessed on 11th Feb 2022.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing the methodology section for detailed descriptions of the dataset used.
3. Confirming dataset characteristics in the results section.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now create a comprehensive entry for the dataset used in the research paper.
