To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hardware Acceleration for Open Radio Access Networks: A Contemporary Overview" by Lopamudra Kundu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing experiments or case studies** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss practical implementations or use cases**, as these often include details about datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will consider whether it discusses any frameworks, methodologies, or tools that might imply the use of datasets, and I will document those accordingly.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
