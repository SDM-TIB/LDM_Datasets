To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LaFFi: Leveraging Hybrid Natural Language Feedback for Fine-tuning Language Models" by Qianxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a framework called LaFFi, which integrates natural language feedback into the fine-tuning of language models, but does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe the process of generating datasets, specifically mentioning the **Predicted Answer Dataset** and the **AI/Human Labelled Feedback Dataset**. 

1. **Predicted Answer Dataset**: This dataset is created by having a pre-trained LLM generate answers for questions in the training dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated as part of their methodology.

2. **AI/Human Labelled Feedback Dataset**: This dataset is annotated using both LLaMA 7B and human annotators. It includes the passage, question, predicted answer, and ground truth answer, along with natural language feedback. Again, there is no specific citation provided for this dataset as it is a product of their experimental setup.

The authors also mention that the base dataset used for constructing their feedback dataset and for in-domain evaluation is **SQuAD 2.0**. This is a well-known dataset in the NLP community, and I will need to find its full citation.

In the **references section**, I will locate the citation for SQuAD 2.0. The citation is as follows:
> Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2018). Know What You Don’t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), 784–789. Melbourne, Australia: Association for Computational Linguistics.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **Predicted Answer Dataset**: Generated by the authors' LLM for training purposes. No citation available as it is not a publicly available dataset.
   
2. **AI/Human Labelled Feedback Dataset**: Annotated dataset using LLaMA 7B and human feedback. No citation available as it is part of the authors' experimental methodology.

3. **SQuAD 2.0**: A widely used question-answering dataset. Citation:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2018). Know What You Don’t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), 784–789. Melbourne, Australia: Association for Computational Linguistics.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for SQuAD 2.0 while noting that the other two datasets do not have formal citations as they are generated or annotated specifically for this research.
