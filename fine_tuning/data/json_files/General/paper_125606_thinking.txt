To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Mapping of CVE Vulnerability Records to MITRE CWE Weaknesses" by Ashraf Haddad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have created a "manually annotated dataset of 4,012 records" for mapping CVE records to CWE weaknesses. This suggests that there is a primary dataset that I need to focus on.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset consists of 4,012 CVE records that have been annotated to map to the 2022 CWE Top 25 weaknesses. They also explain the process of how the dataset was created, including the filtering of CVE records and the annotation process involving multiple annotators.

In this section, I will note the following key points about the dataset:
- The dataset is publicly available and can be accessed via a GitHub repository: https://github.com/ahadda5/annotate_cve.
- The dataset includes metadata attributes such as CVE ID, description, title, and the corresponding CWE labels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the MITRE CWE Top 25, which is crucial for understanding the weaknesses mapped in their dataset. The citation for the CWE Top 25 is:
> The MITRE Corporation. CWE Top 25. https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2022/2022_cwe_top25.html, 2022. Accessed: 2023-01-04.

Additionally, I will ensure to include the citation for the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) since the dataset is based on CVE records from this source:
> CVE National Vulnerability Database. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). https://www.cve.org/, 2022. Accessed: 2022-10-04.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
