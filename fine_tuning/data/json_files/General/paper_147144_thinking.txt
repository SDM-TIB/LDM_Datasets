To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Autonomous Prompt Engineering in Large Language Models" by Daan Kepel and Konstantina Valogianni, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of various tasks, which may imply the presence of datasets, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the evolution of large language models and their training on extensive datasets. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors outline the benchmark datasets used for evaluating the model's performance. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Checkmate in One**: This dataset tests the model’s ability to solve complex spatial and logical problems within the domain of chess. The task requires the LLM to determine a winning move that results in checkmate in one turn.

2. **Word Sorting**: This dataset assesses the LLM’s capability to sort words alphabetically, testing its understanding of alphabetical order and its ability to organize linguistic information systematically.

3. **Game of 24**: This dataset involves arithmetic challenges where the model must manipulate four numbers using basic arithmetic operations to achieve a total of 24, evaluating its numerical reasoning skills.

4. **Geometric Shapes**: This dataset evaluates a model's ability to identify various shapes from their SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) path descriptions, testing its capabilities in visual interpretation and textual data processing.

The authors also mention that the actual datasets are sourced from a GitHub repository provided by Suzgun and Kalai (2024), which is crucial for proper citation.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to retrieve full citations for these datasets:

- For **Checkmate in One**, the citation is:
  > BIG-Bench authors. *Checkmate in One*. In Proceedings of the BIG-Bench Workshop, 2023.

- For **Word Sorting**, the citation is:
  > Suzgun, M., & Kalai, A. T. *Word Sorting Dataset*. In Proceedings of the BIG-Bench Workshop, 2023.

- For **Game of 24**, the citation is:
  > Yao, S., Yu, D., Zhao, J., Shafran, I., Griffiths, T. L., Cao, Y., & Narasimhan, K. *Game of 24 Dataset*. In Proceedings of the BIG-Bench Workshop, 2023.

- For **Geometric Shapes**, the citation is:
  > Suzgun, M., & Kalai, A. T. *Geometric Shapes Dataset*. In Proceedings of the BIG-Bench Workshop, 2023.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are accurately documented for future reference or analysis.
