To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Learning Effectiveness For Object Detection and Classification in Cluttered Backgrounds" by Vinorth Varatharasan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework to generate a training dataset in heterogeneous cluttered backgrounds, which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if any specific datasets are referenced. The authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets in cluttered environments, particularly mentioning the **COCO dataset** as a benchmark for comparison. This indicates that the COCO dataset is relevant to their research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their framework, which includes an object segmentation technique (DeepLab) and a Chroma-keying process. They mention generating an artificial dataset using these techniques, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. However, they do state that they created **10,000 images** for training, which is significant.

In the **results section**, the authors compare the performance of their model trained on the artificial dataset with the model trained on the COCO dataset. They provide performance metrics but do not give a formal citation for the artificial dataset since it is generated by their framework.

Now, I will check the **references section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Since the authors did not provide a formal citation for the artificial dataset they generated, I will note that it is a product of their proposed framework and does not have a traditional citation.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets identified:

- **Artificial Dataset**: Generated using the proposed Seg-CK framework, consisting of 10,000 images created by combining objects with heterogeneous backgrounds.
- **COCO Dataset**: A well-known dataset used for object detection and classification, serving as a benchmark for comparison in the study.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries for further processing or review.
