To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EEE-QA: Exploring Effective and Efficient Question-Answer Representations" by Zhanghao Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract discusses the exploration of question-answer representations and mentions the use of various pooling methods, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Data and evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate their approaches on two QA datasets:

1. **CommonsenseQA**: This dataset contains 12,102 questions, each paired with five answer candidates, and is designed to test common-sense knowledge. The authors follow the in-house data split by Lin et al. (2019) since the official test set is not public.

2. **OpenBookQA**: This dataset comprises 5,957 four-way multiple-choice questions related to elementary scientific knowledge. The authors follow the official data splits for this dataset.

In this section, the authors provide enough detail about the datasets, including their purpose and structure, which confirms their relevance to the research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CommonsenseQA**, the citation is:
  > Alon Talmor, Jonathan Herzig, Nicholas Lourie, and Jonathan Berant. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. In Proceedings of the NAACL, 2019.

- For **OpenBookQA**, the citation is:
  > Todor Mihaylov, Peter Clark, Tushar Khot, and Ashish Sabharwal. *Can a suit of armor conduct electricity? A new dataset for open book question answering*. In Proceedings of the EMNLP, 2018.

Having gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
