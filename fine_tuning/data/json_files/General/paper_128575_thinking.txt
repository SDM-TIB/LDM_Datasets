To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GuP: Fast Subgraph Matching by Guard-based Pruning" by Yasuhiro Fujiwara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the GuP algorithm and its efficiency in subgraph matching, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is likely to be section 4 based on typical paper structures) to find specific datasets used for evaluation. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, sizes, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions datasets like "Yeast" or "Human," I will look for their full citations in the references. If the datasets are publicly available, I will also note where they can be accessed.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and useful for anyone looking to understand the datasets used in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview of the data used in the study.
