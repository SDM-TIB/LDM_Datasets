To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Linear Forests" by Rina Friedberg et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help in understanding their relevance.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using a dataset from the **General Social Survey (GSS)** to explore the effect of word choice on attitudes toward the social safety net. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of observations and the variables involved.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. It is crucial to provide complete citations to ensure that others can locate the datasets easily. For the GSS dataset, I will look for the citation that includes the authors, title, publication year, and any relevant details about the dataset's availability.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
