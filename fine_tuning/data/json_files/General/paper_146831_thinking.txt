To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Enhanced Classification of Abnormal Lung Sound in Multi-breath: A Light Weight Multi-label and Multi-head Attention Classification Method" by Yi-Wei Chua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes the **ICBHI2017 dataset**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material and Methods)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **ICBHI 2017 Dataset**. Here, they describe the dataset as comprising 6,898 respiratory cycles totaling approximately 5.5 hours of audio. The dataset is divided into a training set (60%) and a test set (40%), with specific details about the number of recordings and categories (Normal, Crackle, Wheeze, Crackle & Wheeze).

In this section, I will note the specifics of the dataset, including:
- The total number of respiratory cycles.
- The duration of the audio.
- The division of the dataset into training and test sets.
- The categories of sounds included.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ICBHI 2017 dataset**. The citation is:
> "ICBHI 2017 Dataset." *International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (ICBHI)*, 2017.

Since this is a conference dataset, I will ensure to format the citation correctly, including the year and the conference name.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **ICBHI 2017 dataset** as it is crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all extracted information is accurate and complete.
