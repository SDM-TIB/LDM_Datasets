To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Multi-Task Semantic Communication System for Multimodal Data" by Guangyi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or tasks that imply the use of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the motivation and contributions of their work. They mention various tasks and modalities, which may hint at the datasets used for these tasks. I will take note of any specific datasets mentioned.

Then, I will examine the **experiments or results section**, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets, such as their size, type, and source.

In this paper, the authors mention several tasks and corresponding datasets in the **simulation results section**. Specifically, they refer to the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Used for both image classification and image reconstruction tasks. This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

2. **SST-2 Dataset**: Utilized for text classification and text reconstruction tasks. This dataset contains 67,349 sentences labeled for sentiment analysis.

3. **VQAv2 Dataset**: Employed for the visual question answering task. This dataset consists of images and corresponding questions about the images, with multiple-choice answers.

4. **MOSEI Dataset**: Used for video sentiment analysis. This dataset contains videos annotated with sentiment labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will provide additional context about each dataset.

For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Socher, Richard, et al. "Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank." In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 1631-1642. 2013.

For the **VQAv2 Dataset**, the citation is:
> Antol, Stanislaw, et al. "VQA: Visual Question Answering." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 2425-2433. 2015.

For the **MOSEI Dataset**, the citation is:
> Zadeh, Amir, et al. "Multimodal sentiment analysis using audio, visual and text information." In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pp. 505-515. 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future use.
