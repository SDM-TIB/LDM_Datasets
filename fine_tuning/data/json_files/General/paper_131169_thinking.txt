To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boosting Diffusion Models with an Adaptive Momentum Sampler" by Xiyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experimental results are based on multiple benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will note any specific datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will look into the **experimental section** of the paper, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly list the datasets in the **Experimental Setup** section. They mention the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.
3. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.
4. **LSUN**: A dataset containing millions of labeled images across various categories, specifically designed for scene understanding tasks.
5. **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality version of the CelebA dataset, containing 30,000 images at a resolution of 256x256.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2018). *Large-scale celebfaces attributes (celeba) dataset*. Retrieved August 15, 2018.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 248â€“255.

- For **LSUN**, the citation is:
  > Yu, F., Seff, A., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Funkhouser, T., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T., Aila, T., Laine, S., & Lehtinen, J. (2017). *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10196.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further analysis or processing.
