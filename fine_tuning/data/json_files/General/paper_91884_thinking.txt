To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graphical Normalizing Flows" by Antoine Wehenkel and Gilles Louppe, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used. I will pay special attention to any mentions of datasets, particularly in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often contain crucial details such as the number of samples, dimensions, and specific characteristics of each dataset.

In the paper, I find a **Table 1** that lists several datasets along with their dimensions and other relevant information. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Arithmetic Circuit**: This dataset consists of 8 dimensions and 8 edges in the ground truth Bayesian Network.
2. **8 Pairs**: This dataset has 16 dimensions and 8 edges.
3. **Tree**: This dataset has 7 dimensions and 8 edges.
4. **Protein**: This dataset has 11 dimensions and 20 edges.
5. **POWER**: This dataset has 6 dimensions and 15 edges.
6. **GAS**: This dataset has 1,659,917 samples.
7. **HEPMASS**: This dataset has 21 dimensions and 315,123 samples.
8. **MINIBOONE**: This dataset has 43 dimensions and 29,556 samples.
9. **BSDS300**: This dataset has 63 dimensions and 1,000,000 samples.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the datasets may not have dedicated citations in the references, so I will need to rely on the context provided in the paper. For example, the **Protein dataset** is derived from a study by Sachs et al. (2005), which I will cite accordingly.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- **Arithmetic Circuit**: No specific citation provided; it is based on the generative model described by Weilbach et al. (2020).
- **8 Pairs**: No specific citation provided; it is an artificial dataset created by the authors.
- **Tree**: No specific citation provided; it is based on toy problems from Grathwohl et al. (2018).
- **Protein**: 
  > Sachs, K., Perez, O., Peâ€™er, D. A., Lauffenburger, D. A., & Nolan, G. P. (2005). Causal protein-signaling networks derived from multiparameter single-cell data. *Science*, 308, 523-529.
- **POWER**: No specific citation provided; it is a benchmark dataset.
- **GAS**: No specific citation provided; it is a benchmark dataset.
- **HEPMASS**: No specific citation provided; it is a benchmark dataset.
- **MINIBOONE**: No specific citation provided; it is a benchmark dataset.
- **BSDS300**: No specific citation provided; it is a benchmark dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
