To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Edinburgh International Accents of English Corpus: Towards the Democratization of English ASR" by Ramon Sanabria et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract introduces "The Edinburgh International Accents of English Corpus (EdAcc)" as a new dataset, which is a strong indication that this is the primary dataset discussed in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The authors describe EdAcc as containing almost 40 hours of dyadic video call conversations, highlighting its diversity in representing various English accents. This section confirms that EdAcc is the main dataset of interest.

I will then look into **section 3 (The Edinburgh International Accents of English Corpus)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that EdAcc includes:
- Approximately 40 hours of video call conversations.
- Contributions from speakers with over 40 self-reported English accents from 51 different first languages.
- Linguistic background profiles for each speaker.

This section solidifies my understanding of the dataset's scope and content.

In the **experiments section**, the authors evaluate the performance of various automatic speech recognition (ASR) models on the EdAcc dataset. They report results that indicate the dataset's challenges for current ASR systems, further emphasizing its significance.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EdAcc dataset. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention that it is available on their website under a CC-BY-SA license. Therefore, I will create a citation based on the paper itself, as it is the primary source for the dataset.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Ramon Sanabria, Nikolay Bogoychev, Nina Markl, Andrea Carmantini, Ondrej Klejch, Peter Bell. *The Edinburgh International Accents of English Corpus: Towards the Democratization of English ASR*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2023.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the essential details of the dataset as presented in the paper.
