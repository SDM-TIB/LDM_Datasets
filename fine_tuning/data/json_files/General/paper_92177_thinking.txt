To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Locality-Aware Regression for Labeled Data Classification" by Liangchen Hu and Wensheng Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors used to validate their proposed method. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**, particularly **Table I**, which summarizes the datasets used in the experiments. This table lists various datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of instances, features, and classes. The datasets mentioned in this table are crucial for understanding the scope of the experiments conducted.

The datasets identified in Table I are:

1. **Dermatology**: 
   - Instances: 366
   - Features: 34
   - Classes: 6

2. **Diabetes**: 
   - Instances: 768
   - Features: 8
   - Classes: 2

3. **Ionosphere**: 
   - Instances: 351
   - Features: 34
   - Classes: 2

4. **Iris**: 
   - Instances: 150
   - Features: 4
   - Classes: 3

5. **Wine**: 
   - Instances: 178
   - Features: 13
   - Classes: 3

6. **Binalpha**: 
   - Instances: 1404
   - Features: 320
   - Classes: 36

7. **YaleB**: 
   - Instances: 2414
   - Features: 1024
   - Classes: 38

8. **AR**: 
   - Instances: 1400
   - Features: 1024
   - Classes: 100

9. **COIL20**: 
   - Instances: 1440
   - Features: 1024
   - Classes: 20

10. **Caltech101**: 
    - Instances: 9144
    - Features: 3000
    - Classes: 102

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, the citation for the **Iris dataset** is:
> R. A. Fisher, "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems," Ann. Eugen., vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 179-188, 1936.

Similarly, I will look for citations for the other datasets mentioned in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, characteristics, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
