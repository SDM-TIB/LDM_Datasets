To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Collaborative Data Analytics System with Recommender" by Siu Lung Ng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the SLEGO system and its capabilities but does not specify any datasets. The introduction also focuses on the system's purpose and challenges in data analytics without naming specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **background and literature review** section, particularly looking for any references to datasets used in previous studies. This section discusses various tools and frameworks but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **implementation** and **case studies** sections, I will look for any practical applications of the SLEGO system that might involve datasets. In the case studies, the authors describe how the system was used for financial data analytics, but they do not provide specific dataset names.

I will also check the **appendices** for any configuration details or examples that might include dataset references. The appendices contain examples of microservices and configurations but do not provide full dataset citations.

Finally, I will review the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of the studies mentioned. The references include various papers and resources, but I need to ensure that any datasets mentioned are properly cited.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the findings. If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations. If no specific datasets are identified, I will note that as well.

In summary, I will:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, background, implementation, and case studies for dataset mentions.
2. Check the appendices for any dataset configurations.
3. Review the references for any dataset citations.
4. Document any identified datasets with their full citations or note the absence of specific datasets.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately extract and cite any datasets referenced in the paper.
