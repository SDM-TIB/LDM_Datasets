To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relation-Based Associative Joint Location for Human Pose Estimation in Videos" by Yonghao Dang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **Experiments** section.

Upon reviewing the **Experiments** section, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Penn Action Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 2,326 video clips divided into training and testing groups, with annotations for 13 body joints per frame.

2. **Sub-JHMDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 316 video clips, with annotations for 15 body joints, and the authors specify the training and testing splits.

3. **PoseTrack2018 Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for multi-person human pose estimation, which includes 593 training samples, 170 validation samples, and 375 testing samples, providing annotations for 15 joints.

4. **HiEve Dataset**: This dataset is designed for understanding human behaviors in complex events and contains 32 video sequences with annotations for human poses in each frame, totaling 1,099,357 human poses.

5. **COCO2017 Dataset**: Used for image-based evaluation, this dataset consists of over 57K training images and 150K training person instances, with each instance having 17 joints.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for structured output or further processing.
