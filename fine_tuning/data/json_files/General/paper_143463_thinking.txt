To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic segmentation of Organs at Risk in Head and Neck cancer patients from CT and MRI scans" by Sébastien Quetin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves segmentation of Organs at Risk (OARs) from CT and MRI scans, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention using paired CT and MRI-T1 images from **42 H&N cancer patients** and specifically reference the **H&N OAR CT & MR segmentation challenge dataset**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset, including the number of patients and the specific OARs that were annotated. They also mention that the dataset was used to train their segmentation pipeline and that an independent test set of **14 new patients** was used for evaluation. 

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- **H&N OAR CT & MR segmentation challenge dataset**:
  > G. Podobnik et al. “HaN-Seg: The head and neck organ-at-risk CT and MR segmentation dataset”. In: *Medical Physics* 50.3 (Mar. 2023), pp. 1917–1927. doi: 10.1002/mp.16197.

Since this dataset is central to the study, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
