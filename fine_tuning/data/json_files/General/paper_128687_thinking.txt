To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When and Why Momentum Accelerates SGD: An Empirical Study" by Jingwen Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **CIFAR10 dataset** using the VGG13-BN network. This indicates that CIFAR10 is a dataset relevant to their study.

I will also check the **related works section** and the **conclusion** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, it seems that CIFAR10 is the primary dataset used for the experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR10 dataset. The CIFAR10 dataset is commonly referenced in the literature, and I can find its citation as follows:

- **CIFAR10 Dataset**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
