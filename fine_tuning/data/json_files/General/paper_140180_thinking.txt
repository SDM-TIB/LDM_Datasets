To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tune without Validation: Searching for Learning Rate and Weight Decay on Training Sets" by Lorenzo Brigato and Stavroula Mougiakakou, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **20 image classification datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.2 (Small Datasets)**, they mention specific datasets used for their experiments. The datasets listed include:

1. **ciFAIR-10**: A dataset containing 50 samples per class, used for image classification tasks.
2. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification, also with 50 samples per class.
3. **CLaMM**: A dataset consisting of grayscale hand-written documents, with 50 samples per class.
4. **ISIC 2018**: A dataset for skin lesion analysis, with 80 samples per class.
5. **CUB**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, which includes 30 images per category.

In **section 4.3 (Medical Images)**, the authors refer to the **MedMNIST v2 benchmark**, which includes 11 tasks covering various medical imaging modalities.

In **section 4.4 (Natural Images)**, they mention using popular datasets such as **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny Imagenet**, which are well-known in the image classification community.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
