To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Verification of Recurrent Neural Networks Through Rule Extraction" by Qinglong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it can hint at their existence.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the challenges of verifying recurrent neural networks and may reference datasets used for their experiments. If they mention any specific datasets or grammars, I will take note of them.

In **section 5 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used for training and testing. They mention using the **Tomita grammars** as the basis for generating datasets. I will look for specific details about these grammars, including how many grammars were used and any relevant characteristics.

The paper refers to **seven Tomita grammars** (G1 to G7) that are commonly used in the study of DFA extraction for recurrent networks. I will summarize the descriptions of these grammars as they are crucial for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the Tomita grammars, as they are foundational to the experiments conducted in this paper. The original work on Tomita grammars is as follows:

- For **Tomita grammars**, the citation is:
  > Tomita, M. (1982). Dynamic construction of finite automata from examples using hill-climbing. In Proceedings of the Fourth Annual Cognitive Science Conference, 105â€“108.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and future use.
