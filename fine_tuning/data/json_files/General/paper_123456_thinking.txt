To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-FiLM: Conditioning GANs with self-supervised representations for bandwidth extension based speaker recognition" by Saurabh Kataria et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions improvements in Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) using a Conditional GAN (CGAN) on the SRE21 test, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe the datasets used for training and testing. They mention using **VoxCeleb** and **SRE Superset** for training, and they specify three test sets: **SRE16-YUE-eval40**, **SRE-CTS-superset-dev**, and **SRE21-audio-eval**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of each dataset in the paper. The authors provide information about the **VoxCeleb dataset**, stating it contains over 2700 hours of audio from 7365 speakers, which is significant for speaker recognition tasks. They also describe the **SRE telephone dataset**, which is a combination of SRE Superset and SRE16 eval data, indicating it includes multiple languages.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution:

1. **VoxCeleb**:

2. **SRE Superset**:

3. **SRE16**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
