To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Dynamic Convolution for Efficient Single-Image Segmentation" by Xin Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **three benchmark segmentation datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors discuss their methodology and results. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Pascal-Context**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of their proposed method. The authors highlight that their Gaussian Dynamic Convolution (GDC) achieves competitive results on this dataset.

2. **Pascal-VOC 2012**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for their experiments. The authors report performance metrics on this dataset, indicating its significance in their evaluation.

3. **Cityscapes**: The authors mention using this dataset for semantic segmentation tasks, further confirming its role in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Pascal-Context**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. J. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. M. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

- For **Pascal-VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. J. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. M. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), vol. 88, no. 2, pp. 303–338, 2010.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
