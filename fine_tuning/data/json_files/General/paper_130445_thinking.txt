To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Baby Llama: knowledge distillation from an ensemble of teachers trained on a small dataset with no performance penalty" by Inar Timiryasov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors trained an ensemble on the **10M-word BabyLM dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. Here, the authors mention the BabyLM challenge and the focus on a developmentally plausible corpus, which reinforces the importance of the **10M-word BabyLM dataset**.

Moving on to the **dataset section (Section 3)**, I will look for a detailed description of the datasets used. The authors describe the **train dataset** as consisting of approximately **10M words** that include transcribed speech and children's books. They also mention a **dev dataset** of approximately **9.4M words** used for validation and testing. This section provides essential details about the datasets, including their composition and purpose.

In addition, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments. The authors reference the **10M-word BabyLM dataset** as the primary dataset for training their models, which validates its significance.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the BabyLM dataset. The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but the authors mention the BabyLM challenge and its associated papers. I will note that the dataset is derived from a corpus that is developmentally plausible, primarily consisting of transcribed speech and children's literature.

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **BabyLM Dataset**: A dataset consisting of approximately **10M words** primarily from transcribed speech and children's books, used for training language models in the BabyLM challenge.

2. **Dev Dataset**: A validation dataset of approximately **9.4M words**, similar in nature to the BabyLM dataset, used for testing and validation purposes.

Since the BabyLM dataset is central to the paper, I will provide the citation for the BabyLM challenge as follows:
> Warstadt, A., Choshen, L., Cotterell, R., Linzen, T., Mueller, A., Wilcox, E., Adina, W., & Zhuang, C. (2023). Findings of the BabyLM Challenge: Sample-efficient pretraining on developmentally plausible corpora. In Proceedings of the BabyLM Challenge. Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
