To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse Title Generation for Stack Overflow Posts with Multiple Sampling Enhanced Transformer" by Fengji Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors built a **large-scale dataset with 890,000 question posts covering eight programming languages**. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experimental setup** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention the challenges faced by developers in writing high-quality posts and how their dataset aims to address this issue. They also highlight the dataset's size and diversity, which is crucial for validating their approach.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors provide more detailed information about the dataset construction. They mention that the dataset, referred to as **D_so**, is built on the **SOTorrent dataset** proposed by Baltes et al. This dataset includes posts from July 2008 to December 2020 and contains various programming languages, ensuring a comprehensive representation of Stack Overflow content.

The authors also specify the criteria for selecting posts to include in the dataset, such as ensuring that the posts are not closed, have accepted answers, receive more than one vote, and include code snippets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's quality and relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SOTorrent dataset, which is the primary source for their dataset. The citation is:

- Baltes, S., Dumani, L., Treude, C., & Diehl, S. (2018). *Sotorrent: Reconstructing and analyzing the evolution of stack overflow posts*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 319â€“330.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the SOTorrent dataset as it is the foundational dataset for their research. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the study.
