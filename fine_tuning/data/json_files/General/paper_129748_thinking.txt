To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tangent Transformers for Composition, Privacy and Removal" by Tian Yu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on various downstream visual classification tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **Section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Caltech-256**: This dataset is referenced as containing 256 object categories and is commonly used for object recognition tasks.
2. **MIT-67**: This dataset consists of 67 indoor scene categories, which is also widely used in visual recognition tasks.
3. **Oxford Pets**: This dataset includes images of cats and dogs, annotated with breed labels.
4. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset contains images of various dog breeds, annotated for fine-grained classification.
5. **CUB-200**: This dataset is used for fine-grained bird classification and includes 200 bird species.
6. **FGVC-Aircrafts**: This dataset is focused on fine-grained classification of aircraft types.
7. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset includes images of cars, annotated with make and model information.

In **Section 4.2**, the authors provide performance comparisons across these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
