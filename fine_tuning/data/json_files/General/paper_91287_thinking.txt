To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting and Counting Pistachios Based on Deep Learning" by Mohammad Rahimzadeh and Abolfazl Attar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors have introduced a new dataset called **Pesteh-Set**, which includes videos and labeled pistachios. This is a clear indication that a dataset is present, and I need to gather more details.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Pesteh-Set)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, I will find that the dataset consists of two parts: 

1. **Images**: 423 images with ground truth annotations for open-mouth and closed-mouth pistachios, totaling 3927 pistachios.
2. **Videos**: Six videos with a total of 9486 frames, which include 561 motile pistachios and over 350,000 single pistachios.

The authors also mention that the dataset is available on GitHub, which is important for citation and accessibility.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors have provided a link to the dataset on GitHub, which serves as the citation:

- **Pesteh-Set**: 
  > Rahimzadeh, M., & Attar, A. (2021). *Detecting and Counting Pistachios Based on Deep Learning*. GitHub repository. Available at: https://github.com/mr7495/Pesteh-Set

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Pesteh-Set
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 423 labeled images and six videos for counting open-mouth and closed-mouth pistachios.
   - **Total Pistachios**: 3927 labeled pistachios in images; 561 motile pistachios in videos.
   - **Video Frames**: 9486 frames in total.
   - **Availability**: Shared on GitHub.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citation is included for future use. This step-by-step approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the dataset from the research paper.
