To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A novel time–frequency Transformer based on self–attention mechanism and its application in fault diagnosis of rolling bearings" by Yifei Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted case studies on bearing experimental datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** where the authors describe their experiments. In **section 5 (Case studies and analysis)**, they mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **ABLT-1A Bearing Dataset 6308**: This dataset includes vibration signals collected from a rolling bearing under various fault conditions. The authors specify that the dataset contains 14,000 samples across seven fault types, with detailed descriptions of the conditions under which the data was collected.

2. **ABLT-1A Bearing Dataset 6205**: This dataset consists of vibration signals from a different rolling bearing, collected under various rotational speeds and fault conditions. The authors mention that this dataset contains 24,000 samples across six fault types.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely not published in the same way as traditional datasets, I will note the details provided in the paper instead of looking for external citations.

For the **ABLT-1A Bearing Dataset 6308**, the relevant details are:
- Collected from a rolling bearing HRB6308.
- Contains 14,000 samples across seven fault conditions.
- Collected using a monoaxial vibration acceleration sensor at a sampling frequency of 12,800 Hz.

For the **ABLT-1A Bearing Dataset 6205**, the relevant details are:
- Collected from a rolling bearing HRB6205.
- Contains 24,000 samples across six fault conditions at different rotational speeds.
- Collected using a triaxial acceleration sensor at a sampling frequency of 12,000 Hz.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant details, ensuring to include the full citations as described in the paper.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined with its respective details.
