To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Click prediction boosting via Bayesian hyperparameter optimization based ensemble learning pipelines" by Çağatay Demirel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses predicting clicks for hotels using data from an OTA (Online Travel Agency) in Turkey, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors mention using a large OTA's data from Turkey. They describe the dataset as containing both numerical and categorical features, but I need to find specific details about the dataset, such as its name and any relevant characteristics.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 2.1 (Dataset Generation and Data Preprocessing)**, the authors elaborate on how the data is retrieved from a major OTA company in Turkey. They mention that the dataset includes daily reports from the meta-search platform combined with the OTA's data, but they do not provide a specific name for the dataset.

Since the dataset is derived from a major OTA in Turkey, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset and may not have a formal citation. However, I will still document the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any papers or sources are cited that could provide more context or a formal citation for the dataset. The references include studies related to click prediction and hotel booking data, but they do not specifically cite the dataset used in this research.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: OTA Click Prediction Dataset (proprietary)
   - **Description**: This dataset is derived from a major Online Travel Agency in Turkey and includes both numerical and categorical features related to hotel bookings and click predictions. It contains daily reports from the meta-search platform combined with the OTA's data.
   - **Characteristics**: The dataset includes features such as bid amounts, predicted click-through rates, and other relevant metrics for predicting hotel clicks.

Since there is no formal citation for this proprietary dataset, I will note that it is based on data from a major OTA in Turkey without a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
