To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive SVM+: Learning with Privileged Information for Domain Adaptation" by Nikolaos Sarafianos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two publicly available datasets: **Animals with Attributes** and **INTERACT**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to gather detailed descriptions of each dataset. In **Section 4.1**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the **Animals with Attributes Dataset**. They mention that it consists of 6,180 images from 50 animal classes, with specific features and annotations used for training and testing. 

In **Section 4.2**, the authors describe the **INTERACT Dataset**, which contains 3,172 images of interactions between two people, along with clip art illustrations. This section also details how the dataset is structured and how it is utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Animals with Attributes Dataset**, the citation is:
> Lampert, C. H., Nickisch, H., & Harmeling, S. (2014). Attribute-based classification for zero-shot visual object categorization. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 36(3), 453-465.

For the **INTERACT Dataset**, the citation is:
> Antol, S., Zitnick, L. M., & Parikh, D. (2014). Zero-shot learning via visual abstraction. In *Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 1-16). 

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
