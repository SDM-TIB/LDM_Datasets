To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decentralized Gossip-Based Stochastic Bilevel Optimization over Communication Networks" by Shuoguang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions testing the algorithm on examples of **hyperparameter tuning and decentralized reinforcement learning**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The introduction discusses applications of stochastic bilevel optimization but does not specify any datasets directly. However, it does mention the context of federated learning and decentralized settings, indicating that datasets are likely used in the experiments.

I will then focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe two specific applications: **hyperparameter optimization** and **policy evaluation in Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**. I will look for any datasets mentioned in these contexts.

In the **hyperparameter optimization** subsection, the authors refer to the **Australia handwriting dataset**. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note its details.

In the **policy evaluation** subsection, the authors describe a multi-agent MDP problem but do not specify a dataset name. Instead, they describe the state space and the features used, which implies that the dataset is generated rather than sourced from a pre-existing dataset.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Australia Handwriting Dataset**: This dataset is used for hyperparameter optimization in handwriting recognition tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin. *Libsvm: A library for support vector machines*. ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2(3):1â€“27, 2011. URL: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/.

For the MDP problem, since no specific dataset is cited, I will note that the dataset is generated based on the simulation environment described in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I include full citations for the datasets identified.
