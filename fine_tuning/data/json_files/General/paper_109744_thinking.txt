To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diagnosis of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-ray Images Using Deep Neural Network and LightGBM" by Mobina Ezzoddin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method was evaluated on the **ChestX-ray8 dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the dataset. The introduction does not provide further information about datasets, so I will move on.

In the **experimental results section (V)**, the authors explicitly mention the **ChestX-ray8 dataset** again, providing details about its composition: it includes a total of 1125 images, consisting of 125 images of patients with COVID-19, 500 images of patients with pneumonia, and 500 images of patients with no findings. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ChestX-ray8 dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2019). ChestX-ray: Hospital-Scale Chest X-ray Database and Benchmarks on Weakly Supervised Classification and Localization of Common Thorax Diseases. *Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 369-392. doi:10.1007/978-3-030-13969-8_18.

Since the paper primarily discusses the **ChestX-ray8 dataset**, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **ChestX-ray8 dataset** with its full citation, ensuring that it is ready for any further processing or review.
