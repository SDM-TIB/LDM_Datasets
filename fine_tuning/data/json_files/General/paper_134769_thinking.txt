To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval and Generative Approaches for a Pregnancy Chatbot in Nepali with Stemmed and Non-Stemmed Data: A Comparative Study" by Sujan Poudel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves two different NLP-based approaches and mentions the performance analysis of both stemmed and non-stemmed datasets. This suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the **Data Collection** and **Dataset Preparation** subsections. Here, the authors describe their data collection process, which involved scraping FAQs from various medical websites. They mention that they collected a total of **1,159 different questions and answers** in English, which were then processed to create a larger dataset.

In the **Dataset Preparation** subsection, they detail how they eliminated duplicates and translated the dataset into Nepali, resulting in **18,925 questions in 817 categories**. This indicates that the dataset is substantial and well-structured.

Now, I will look for any specific names or citations for the datasets used. The authors do not provide formal names for the datasets they created, but they do mention the sources from which they scraped the data. These sources can be considered as the basis for the dataset.

I will compile the information regarding the dataset as follows:

1. **Pregnancy FAQ Dataset**: This dataset was created by scraping FAQs from various medical websites, including:
   - Public Health England
   - World Health Organization (WHO)
   - National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
   - Ministry of Health and Wellness Bahamas

The dataset consists of **18,925 questions and answers** in Nepali, categorized into **817 groups**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the datasets or the sources used for data collection. The authors reference several papers and sources, but they do not provide a formal citation for the dataset itself since it is an original compilation.

Since the dataset is derived from publicly available information from reputable health organizations, I will note these sources as part of the dataset description.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the sources from which the data was scraped, as these are critical for citation purposes.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for structured output, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
