To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAST MODEL EDITING AT SCALE" by Eric Mitchell et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "editing datasets" for model editing, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several editing datasets, including:

1. **zsRE Question-Answering Dataset**: This dataset is used for editing models in a question-answering context. The authors note that it includes question rephrasings generated by backtranslation and provides train/val splits generated by De Cao et al. (2021).

2. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is mentioned as another source for editing models, specifically for question-answering tasks. The authors indicate that they sample locality examples from NQ when editing models pre-trained on this dataset.

3. **FEVER Fact-Checking Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for classification models, where the authors mention using fact rephrasings and train/val splits generated by De Cao et al. (2021).

4. **Wikitext Generation Dataset**: The authors describe creating a dataset for generative tasks, containing approximately 68k pairs of edit inputs and plausible edit labels, with the edit labels generated from a pre-trained distilGPT-2 model.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **zsRE Question-Answering Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Levy, O., Seo, M., Choi, E., & Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *Zero-shot relation extraction via reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017), pages 333–342.

- For the **Natural Questions (NQ)** dataset, the citation is:

W., Uszkoreit, J., & Petrov, S. (2019). *Natural Questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 453-466.

- For the **FEVER Fact-Checking Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Wikitext Generation Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
