To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cluster & Tune: Boost Cold Start Performance in Text Classification" by Eyal Shnarch et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the method's evaluation on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used for their experiments. They mention evaluating their method on **6 topical datasets and 3 non-topical datasets**. I will look for a table or a list that summarizes these datasets, which is likely to be found in this section.

In **Table 1**, the authors list the datasets along with their details, including the number of training and testing instances, the number of classes, and a brief description of each dataset. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Yahoo! Answers**: A dataset that separates answers and questions into types.
2. **DBpedia**: A dataset that differentiates entity types based on their Wikipedia articles.
3. **CFPB**: A dataset that classifies consumer complaints.
4. **20 Newsgroups**: A dataset that classifies 20 Usenet discussion groups.
5. **AG’s News**: A dataset that categorizes news articles.
6. **ISEAR**: A dataset that considers personal reports for emotion.
7. **SMS Spam**: A dataset that identifies spam messages.
8. **Polarity**: A dataset that includes sentiment analysis on movie reviews.
9. **Subjectivity**: A dataset that categorizes movie snippets as subjective or objective.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors provide links for downloading the datasets, which can also serve as a reference. Here are the citations I will compile:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
