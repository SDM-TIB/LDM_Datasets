To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "File Classification Based on Spiking Neural Networks" by Ana Stanojevic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors measured classification accuracy for various publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **simulation results section** (Section III) where the authors mention selecting four datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository for classification tasks. This is a strong indication that the datasets will be explicitly named and described in this section.

In Section III, the authors list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for predicting whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year based on various attributes.

2. **Nursery School Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying nursery school applications based on several features.

3. **Car Evaluation Dataset**: This dataset evaluates cars based on various attributes to classify them into categories.

4. **Connect Four Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the outcome of the Connect Four game based on the game state.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the UCI Machine Learning Repository multiple times, so I will extract the relevant citations for each dataset:

- For the **Adult Income Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI machine learning repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult

- For the **Nursery School Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI machine learning repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/nursery

- For the **Car Evaluation Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI machine learning repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/car+evaluation

- For the **Connect Four Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI machine learning repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
