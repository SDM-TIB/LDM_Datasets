To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shape Adaptor: A Learnable Resizing Module" by Shikun Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors performed experiments across **seven image classification datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets evaluated:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which consists of over 600,000 labeled digits from real-world images.

4. **FGVC-Aircraft**: A fine-grained classification dataset containing images of aircraft, with 10,000 images across 100 categories.

5. **CUBS-200-2011**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, which includes 11,788 images of birds across 200 species.

6. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset containing 16,185 images of cars across 196 classes.

7. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across 20,000 categories, commonly used for image classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: 
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- **CIFAR-100**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
