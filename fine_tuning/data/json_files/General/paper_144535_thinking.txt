To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explicitly Encoding Structural Symmetry is Key to Length Generalization in Arithmetic Tasks" by Mahdi Sabbaghi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of Transformers in arithmetic tasks but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their method allows a Transformer to generalize from numbers with at most 5 digits to those with up to 50 digits. However, they do not name any datasets here either. I will continue to the methodology section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** where datasets are typically described. I will look for any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention that they generated samples uniformly from a specific domain for their arithmetic tasks. However, they do not refer to any publicly available datasets.

Since the paper focuses on the design of a model and its performance on arithmetic tasks rather than on specific datasets, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. I will look for any references that might point to datasets used in similar studies.

Upon reviewing the references, I find that there are no specific datasets cited that are publicly available. The authors primarily discuss their own experimental setup without relying on established datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not provide any specific datasets that can be extracted and cited. Instead, it focuses on the theoretical and empirical contributions of the proposed model. Therefore, I will document that no datasets were identified in the paper.

Now, I will summarize my findings:
1. **No specific datasets were mentioned in the abstract, introduction, or experiments sections.**
2. **The authors generated their own samples for the arithmetic tasks, and no publicly available datasets were referenced.**

This concludes the extraction process for datasets from this research paper.
