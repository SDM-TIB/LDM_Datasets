To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compressive Features in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems" by Minh Pham et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the approach is trained on an **offline dataset that is publicly available on an IEEE Big Data Cup challenge**. This indicates that there is a specific dataset related to the challenge.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe the problem and the context of their work. They mention that the dataset consists of **more than 250,000 playing sessions, 381 items, and approximately 40,000 users**. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's scale and its relevance to the research.

In the **methodology section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset. They describe the structure of the training dataset, which includes user sessions, item information, and various features related to user behavior and item characteristics. This section confirms the dataset's importance in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper cites the dataset as being part of the **IEEE Big Data 2021 Cup**, which is a specific competition. The citation for this dataset is:

- **IEEE Big Data Cup 2021 Dataset**: 
  > FUXI AI Lab, Netease. *IEEE Big Data Cup 2021 Challenge Dataset*. Available at: [IEEE Big Data Cup](https://bigdata.ieee.org/2021/).

Since the dataset is associated with a competition, it is important to note that it may not have a traditional citation format but is instead referenced as part of the competition's resources.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper attribution and facilitate further research or usage of the dataset in related works.
