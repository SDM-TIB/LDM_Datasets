To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wisdom of the Silicon Crowd: LLM Ensemble Prediction Capabilities Rival Human Crowd Accuracy" by Philipp Schoenegger et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a comparison of LLM predictions to those of a human crowd, which suggests that there may be datasets related to human forecasting tournaments.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **Study 1**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention using a set of forecasting questions from a public forecasting tournament on the platform Metaculus, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their analysis.

In **section 2.1 (Study 1)**, the authors specify that they collected data from **twelve diverse large language models** and queried them on **31 binary questions** posed during the tournament. This section provides details about the questions, including their context and resolution criteria, which are essential for understanding the dataset.

I will also look for any specific references to the **Metaculus platform** in the **references section** to obtain the full citation for this dataset. The citation for Metaculus is:
> Metaculus. (2024). Metaculus. https://www.metaculus.com/home/. Accessed: 2024-02-21.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper, particularly in the context of **Study 2**, where the authors analyze the performance of two specific models (GPT-4 and Claude 2) using the same forecasting questions from the Metaculus tournament.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Metaculus Forecasting Tournament Dataset**: This dataset consists of 31 binary forecasting questions posed during a public tournament where 925 human forecasters participated.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Metaculus dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.
