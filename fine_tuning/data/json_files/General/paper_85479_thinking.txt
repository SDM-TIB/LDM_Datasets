To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyper Vision Net: Kidney Tumor Segmentation Using Coordinate Convolutional Layer and Attention Unit" by D. Sabarinathan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized a dataset from the KiTs19 challenge, which is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section** (Section 2) where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. They mention that the dataset consists of multi-phase CT images, segmentation masks, and clinical reports from 300 patients. Specifically, they state that 210 patients' CT images were selected for training and validation, with a total of 32,175 images for training and 13,790 images for validation.

The authors also reference the KiTs19 dataset in the context of their experiments, confirming its use in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the KiTs19 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **KiTs19 dataset**, the citation is:
  > N. Heller, N. Sathianathen, A. Kalapara, E. Walczak, K. Moore, H. Kaluzniak, J. Rosenberg, P. Blake, Z. Rengel, M. Oestreich, J. Dean, M. Tradewell, A. Shah, R. Tejpaul, Z. Edgerton, M. Peterson, S. Raza, S. Regmi, N. Papanikolopoulos, C. Weight. *The KiTS19 Challenge Data: 300 Kidney Tumor Cases with Clinical Context, CT Semantic Segmentations, and Surgical Outcomes*. arXiv: 1904.00445, 2019.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **KiTs19 Dataset**: This dataset includes multi-phase CT images, segmentation masks, and clinical reports from 300 patients, with 32,175 images used for training and 13,790 images for validation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
