To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADMM based Fourier phase retrieval with untrained generative prior" by Liyuan Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for validation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually describe the datasets they used for their numerical experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using images from **MNIST** and **CelebA** datasets for their experiments. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors specify that they selected 6 grayscale images of size 28 × 28 from the MNIST dataset. This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

2. **CelebA Dataset**: The authors also mention using 5 RGB images center-cropped to 64 × 64 × 3 from the CelebA dataset, which is commonly used for facial recognition and attribute prediction tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015. Available at: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
