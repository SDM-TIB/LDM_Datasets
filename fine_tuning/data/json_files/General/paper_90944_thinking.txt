To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LightPAFF: A Two-Stage Distillation Framework for Pre-training and Fine-tuning" by Kaitao Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and mentions experiments on various language understanding tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setting sections** for each model (BERT, GPT-2, and MASS) to find specific datasets used for pre-training and fine-tuning. 

1. **For BERT**:
   - The paper mentions using **BooksCorpus** (800M words) and **Wikipedia** (2500M words) for pre-training.
   - For downstream tasks, it specifies using **SST-2** (Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2), **QQP** (Quora Question Pairs), and **PolyDis** (Polyphone Disambiguation).

2. **For GPT-2**:
   - The pre-training dataset is **WebText**, which is a large corpus derived from web pages.
   - The downstream tasks include **WikiText-2**, **PTB** (Penn Treebank), and **WikiText-103**.

3. **For MASS**:
   - The pre-training dataset consists of **50M monolingual data** from the Newscrawl dataset.
   - The fine-tuning tasks involve **WMT17** (Chinese-English), **WMT14** (English-French), and **WMT16** (English-German).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. Here are the citations I will extract:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
