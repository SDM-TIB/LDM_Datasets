To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Knowledge Distillation for Black-box Hypothesis Transfer Learning" by Yiqin Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions empirical results on "transfer learning benchmark datasets" and a "healthcare dataset," indicating that datasets are indeed used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition, commonly used in machine learning for benchmarking. The authors mention creating a modified version called "m-MNIST" for their experiments.

2. **Office-31 Dataset**: A standard dataset for visual transfer learning, consisting of images from three domains: Amazon, Webcam, and DSLR. The authors describe how they constructed various tasks using this dataset.

3. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: A freely accessible critical care database used for healthcare-related learning tasks. The authors specify that they split this dataset into two domains based on ICU admission types for their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Patrick Haffner, et al. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 1998.

- For the **Office-31 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kate Saenko, Brian Kulis, Mario Fritz, and Trevor Darrell. *Adapting visual category models to new domains*. In Proceedings of the 11th European Conference on Computer Vision, 2010.

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, H Lehman Li-wei, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, et al. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
