To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Table Pretraining towards a Universal Function Space for Heterogeneous Tabular Data" by Jintai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a cross-table pretrained Transformer, XTFORMER, and hints at the use of various tabular datasets for training and evaluation. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mention of datasets used for pretraining and evaluation. In this section, the authors state that they utilized labeled datasets from the high-quality large tabular data benchmark **OpenTabs V1**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

I will also check the **related work** and **methodology sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are specific datasets that the authors refer to when discussing their methodology. The methodology section discusses the challenges of heterogeneous tabular data and the need for diverse datasets, but it primarily focuses on the approach rather than specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used for pretraining and downstream tasks. They mention that they have 294 binary classification datasets and 366 regression datasets for pretraining, and they evaluate the pretrained XTFORMER on 190 downstream tasks organized upon 38 datasets. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets in the main text.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for any papers or datasets that are cited, particularly those that might correspond to the OpenTabs V1 benchmark or any other datasets mentioned in the experiments.

The citation for the **OpenTabs V1** dataset is:
> Chao Ye, Guoshan Lu, Haobo Wang, Liyao Li, Sai Wu, Gang Chen, and Junbo Zhao. *CT-BERT: learning better tabular representations through cross-table pre-training*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.04308, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify potential datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for explicit mentions of datasets.
3. Check the methodology for any additional context on datasets.
4. Refer to the references section for full citations of the datasets mentioned.

By following these steps, I can ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
