To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fiedler Regularization: Learning Neural Networks with Graph Sparsity" by Edric Tam and David Dunson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of neural networks and the need for regularization techniques, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 6 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors describe their experiments on three datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The authors mention that they used a 5-layer feedforward neural network with ReLU activations for this dataset.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 32 Ã— 32 RGB color images across 10 different object classes. The same neural network architecture was used as in the MNIST experiments.

3. **TCGA Pan-Cancer Dataset**: This dataset consists of RNA-sequencing data and cancer classification results for 800 subjects, with 600 subjects used for training and 200 for testing. The input features are 20,531-dimensional vectors of gene expression levels.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **TCGA Pan-Cancer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Weinstein, J. N., Collisson, E. A., Mills, G. B., Shaw, K. R. M., Ozenberger, B. A., Ellrott, K., Shmulevich, I., Sander, C., Stuart, J. M., Network, C. G. A. R., et al. *The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer Analysis Project*. Nature Genetics, 45(10):1113, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
