To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Difference Learning with Compressed Updates: Error-Feedback meets Reinforcement Learning" by Aritra Mitra, George J. Pappas, and Hamed Hassani, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the robustness of reinforcement learning algorithms to perturbations, which may imply the use of datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets used in their experiments. If they refer to any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing the proposed algorithms. This section often contains details about the experimental setup, including the datasets.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any results that reference specific datasets. The authors may provide insights into the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and sizes.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "OpenAI Gym," I would look for the citation:
> Brockman, G., et al. "OpenAI Gym." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01549* (2016).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
