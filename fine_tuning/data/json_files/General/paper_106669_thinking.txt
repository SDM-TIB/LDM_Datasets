To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GaTector: A Unified Framework for Gaze Object Prediction" by Binglu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention that extensive experiments were conducted on the **GOO dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors provide context about gaze object prediction and mention the **GOO dataset** again, highlighting its significance in their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing annotations for gaze points, gaze objects, and bounding boxes for various objects, which is essential information for understanding the dataset's purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors elaborate on the **GOO dataset**, specifying that it consists of two subsets: **GOO-Synth** with 192,000 synthetic images and **GOO-Real** with 9,552 real images. This detailed description confirms the dataset's structure and its relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GOO dataset. The authors cite the dataset as follows:
> Henri Tomas, Marcus Reyes, Raimarc Dionido, Mark Ty, Jonric Mirando, Joel Casimiro, Rowel Atienza, and Richard Guinto. *GOO: A Dataset for Gaze Object Prediction in Retail Environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3125â€“3133, 2021.

With this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **GOO Dataset**: This dataset is used for gaze object prediction and contains annotations for gaze points, gaze objects, and bounding boxes. It has two subsets:
   - **GOO-Synth**: 192,000 synthetic images.
   - **GOO-Real**: 9,552 real images.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the full citation for each dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
