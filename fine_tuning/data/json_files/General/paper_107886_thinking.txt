To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DNNFuser: Transformer as a Generalized Mapper for Fusion in DNN Accelerators" by Xiaoyu Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the workloads and datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that the authors used to validate their proposed method.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several common DNN workloads used for their experiments, including **VGG16, Resnet18, Resnet50, Mobilenet-V2, and Mnasnet**. However, these are not datasets in the traditional sense but rather neural network architectures. I need to check if the authors refer to any specific datasets associated with these models.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the performance of their method on these workloads but do not explicitly mention any datasets used for training or testing. This suggests that the paper may not focus on specific datasets but rather on the performance of the DNN models themselves.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will need to refer to the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the papers that introduced these models. For instance, the original papers for VGG16 and Resnet architectures often reference the datasets they were trained on, such as **ImageNet**.

I will compile the following citations based on the original papers for the mentioned models:

1. **VGG16**:
   > Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman. *Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1556, 2014.

2. **Resnet18**:
   > Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. *Deep residual learning for image recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 770–778, 2016.

3. **Resnet50**:
   > Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. *Deep residual learning for image recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 770–778, 2016.

4. **Mobilenet-V2**:
   > Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov, and Liang-Chieh Chen. *Mobilenetv2: Inverted residuals and linear bottlenecks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4510–4520, 2018.

5. **Mnasnet**:
   > Mingxing Tan, Bo Chen, Ruoming Pang, Vijay Vasudevan, Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, and Quoc V Le. *Mnasnet: Platform-aware neural architecture search for mobile*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 2820–2828, 2019.

Now that I have identified the relevant citations, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure for datasets, even though they are primarily references to model architectures rather than datasets per se. 

In conclusion, while the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I have identified the associated references for the DNN models discussed, which are commonly trained on the ImageNet dataset.
