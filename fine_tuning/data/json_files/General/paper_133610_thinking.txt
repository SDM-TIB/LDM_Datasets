To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Convex Optimization with Switching Cost and Delayed Gradients" by Spandan Senapati and Rahul Vaze, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically detail the datasets used for evaluation and may include descriptions of their characteristics, such as size, type, and source.

In this paper, the authors discuss various applications of their proposed algorithms, such as **server management in data centers, trajectory tracking, and economic power dispatch**. I will check if they reference any datasets related to these applications.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the main text, I will consult the **References section** to see if any cited works are related to datasets. This section may provide full citations for datasets that are foundational to the research.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each:

1. **Name of the dataset**: The title or identifier of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains and its relevance to the research.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I would note its description and then find the full citation, which might look like this:

- **Penn Action Dataset**: A dataset containing 2,326 video clips for action recognition, annotated with 13 joints per frame.

After compiling this information, I will organize it clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its citation for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets mentioned in the paper.
