To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectrally Transformed Kernel Regression" by Runtian Zhai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. This section often includes descriptions of the datasets, such as their size, type, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these can provide concise information.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer back to the datasets when discussing their findings. This can help confirm the datasets used and provide additional context about their relevance to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used the "Cora" dataset, I will look for its citation in the references. A typical citation might look like this:
> McCallum, A., & Kolla, S. (2000). *Efficiently inducing features of arbitrary size for supervised learning*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further analysis. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
