To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Label Smoothing and Logit Squeezing: A Replacement for Adversarial Training?" by Ali Shafahi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of label smoothing and logit squeezing in achieving adversarial robustness, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction provides context about adversarial training but also lacks specific dataset references.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their experiments. This is a crucial finding, as it indicates the datasets utilized in their research.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments. The paper describes the MNIST dataset as a standard benchmark for handwritten digit classification and the CIFAR-10 dataset as a widely used dataset for object recognition tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly. 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
