To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Aligned Contrastive Predictive Coding" by Jan Chorowski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the model on a **speech coding task**, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to identify them explicitly.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for unsupervised speech representation learning and mention various tasks, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **LibriSpeech train-clean-100**. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset**. The citation is as follows:
> A. Panayotov, G. Chen, W. G. Povey, and S. Khudanpur. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction here.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset** is included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
