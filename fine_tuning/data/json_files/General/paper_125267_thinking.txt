To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Very high resolution canopy height maps from RGB imagery using self-supervised vision transformer and convolutional decoder trained on Aerial Lidar" by Jamie Tolan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention key datasets used for generating canopy height maps. 

Next, I will focus on the **Data section**, specifically **section 2**, where the authors describe the datasets used for model training and validation. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

In **subsection 2.4 (Supervised dataset)**, the authors mention gathering approximately **5800 canopy height maps (CHM)** from the **National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)**. This dataset is crucial for their model training. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its resolution and geographic coverage.

Additionally, the authors refer to other datasets used for validation, such as the **"CA-Brande" dataset** and the **"S˜ao Paulo" dataset**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were processed.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:
1. **NEON dataset**: I will find the citation for the NEON dataset as it is a significant source of canopy height maps.
2. **CA-Brande dataset**: I will locate the citation for this dataset, which is used for validation in the study.
3. **S˜ao Paulo dataset**: I will also find the citation for this dataset, which is mentioned in the context of processing CHMs.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
