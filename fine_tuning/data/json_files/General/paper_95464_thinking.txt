To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Information-theoretic Feature Selection via Tensor Decomposition and Submodularity" by Magda Amiridi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experimental section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In the **experimental study section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on real-world datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. They provide a summary table (Table I) that lists the datasets used in their experiments, including:

1. **Phishing Websites**: This dataset has 30 features, 2456 instances, and 2 classes.
2. **Chess (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn)**: This dataset has 36 features, 3196 instances, and 2 classes.
3. **Waveform (Version 2)**: This dataset has 40 features, 5000 instances, and 3 classes.
4. **Gas Sensor Array Drift**: This dataset has 128 features, 13910 instances, and 3 classes.
5. **Semeion**: This dataset has 256 features, 1593 instances, and 10 classes.
6. **Arrhythmia**: This dataset has 279 features, 452 instances, and 16 classes.
7. **MNIST**: This dataset has 784 features, 80000 instances, and 10 classes.
8. **COIL-20**: This dataset has 1024 features, 1440 instances, and 20 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are sourced from the UCI machine learning repository, I will provide a general citation for the repository itself, as individual datasets may not have specific citations in the paper.

The citation for the UCI machine learning repository is:
> Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details and the citation for the UCI repository.

1. **Phishing Websites**
   - Features: 30
   - Instances: 2456
   - Classes: 2

2. **Chess (King-Rook vs. King-Pawn)**
   - Features: 36
   - Instances: 3196
   - Classes: 2

3. **Waveform (Version 2)**
   - Features: 40
   - Instances: 5000
   - Classes: 3

4. **Gas Sensor Array Drift**
   - Features: 128
   - Instances: 13910
   - Classes: 3

5. **Semeion**
   - Features: 256
   - Instances: 1593
   - Classes: 10

6. **Arrhythmia**
   - Features: 279
   - Instances: 452
   - Classes: 16

7. **MNIST**
   - Features: 784
   - Instances: 80000
   - Classes: 10

8. **COIL-20**
   - Features: 1024
   - Instances: 1440
   - Classes: 20

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined along with the citation for the UCI repository.
