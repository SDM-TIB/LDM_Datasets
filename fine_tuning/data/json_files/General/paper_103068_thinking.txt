To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improvement of a Prediction Model for Heart Failure Survival through Explainable Artificial Intelligence" by Pedro A. Moreno-Sanchez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses a dataset comprising **299 patients who suffered heart failure**, which suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Material and Methods)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used for the study. Here, the paper states that the dataset was released by Ahmad et al. and contains medical records of **299 patients (194 men and 105 women)** who experienced heart failure. The dataset includes **7 numerical and 5 nominal features**, along with a binary target feature indicating the death event.

In this section, I will also note the details about the dataset's collection, such as the time frame (April to December 2015) and the institutions involved (Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital in Faisalabad, Punjab, Pakistan). The paper mentions that the dataset is imbalanced, with **203 instances representing patients who survived** and **96 instances representing deceased patients**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset used in this study is:

- Ahmad, T., Munir, A., Bhatti, S.H., Aftab, M., Raza, M.A. (2017). *Survival analysis of heart failure patients: A case study*. PLOS ONE, 12, e0181001. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0181001

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and correctly formatted.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
