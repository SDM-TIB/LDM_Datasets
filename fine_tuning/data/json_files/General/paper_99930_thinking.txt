To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "UoT-UWF-PartAI at SemEval-2021 Task 5: Self Attention Based Bi-GRU with Multi-Embedding Representation for Toxicity Highlighter" by Hamed Babaei Giglou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the task and the proposed model, but it does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **results section**.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors state that they used the **Civil Comments dataset** for their toxic span detection task. They mention that this dataset consists of 7939 annotated comments with their toxic spans for training and 2000 for testing, along with 690 samples treated as a development set. This section provides clear information about the dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Civil Comments dataset. The authors reference a paper by John Pavlopoulos et al. (2021) regarding the SemEval-2021 Task 5, which is where the dataset is likely described.

The citation for the Civil Comments dataset is:
> John Pavlopoulos, LÃ©o Laugier, Jeffrey Sorensen, and Ion Androutsopoulos. *SemEval-2021 task 5: Toxic spans detection (to appear)*. In Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, I have extracted the following dataset information:
1. **Civil Comments Dataset**: Contains 7939 annotated comments for training, 2000 for testing, and 690 for development.

I will ensure to include the full citation for the dataset in any subsequent structured output.
