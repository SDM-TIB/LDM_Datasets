To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cascade R-CNN: Delving into High Quality Object Detection" by Zhaowei Cai and Nuno Vasconcelos, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights that the Cascade R-CNN surpasses all previous state-of-the-art single-model detectors on the challenging **COCO dataset**, indicating that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors state that the Cascade R-CNN was evaluated on the **MS-COCO 2017** dataset, which contains approximately 118,000 images for training, 5,000 for validation, and 20,000 for testing without provided annotations. This confirms that MS-COCO is a primary dataset used in their evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> T. Lin, M. Maire, S. J. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755, 2014.

Since the paper primarily discusses the COCO dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, including the full citation, ensuring that it is ready for downstream processing or review.
