To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "GLUFORMER: Transformer-Based Personalized Glucose Forecasting with Uncertainty Quantification" by Renat Sergazinov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically demonstrate their method on "synthetic and benchmark glucose data sets." This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved, but I need to identify them specifically.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Synthetic Data Set**: This dataset consists of 2000 time series generated using a mixture of Gaussian Processes, with specific characteristics outlined in the text.

2. **Benchmark Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) Data Set**: This dataset is publicly available and contains glucose levels of 38 subjects tracked continuously. The authors provide details about the measurement frequency and the number of observations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the benchmark CGM dataset as follows:

- For the **Benchmark CGM Data Set**, the citation is:
  > Ian Fox, Lynn Ang, Mamta Jaiswal, Rodica Pop-Busui, and Jenna Wiens. *Deep Multi-Output Forecasting: Learning to Accurately Predict Blood Glucose Trajectories*. In Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD, pages 1387â€“1395, July 2018.

The synthetic dataset does not have a specific citation since it is generated by the authors for the purpose of their study.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the benchmark CGM dataset. The synthetic dataset will be noted as generated by the authors without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a clear and concise format for further processing or review.
