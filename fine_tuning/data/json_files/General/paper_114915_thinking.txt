To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Merging and Comparing Ontologies Algebraically" by Xiuzhan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Ontology Merging Closures and Finiteness)** and **section 5 (Ontology Merging Given by Pushouts)**, as these sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments or theoretical frameworks. I will look for any specific datasets that are defined or referenced, particularly in examples or case studies.

In the paper, the authors mention several ontology systems and operations, but I need to identify if any specific datasets are explicitly named. If they are, I will take note of their names, descriptions, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like "GeoDataOnt," I will look for its citation in the references, which might include the authors, title, publication venue, and year. If the dataset is derived from another source, I will ensure to cite the original work.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
