To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Reflection Removal with Reflection Intensity Prior Knowledge" by Dongshen Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset called **Categorized, Diverse, and Real-world (CDR)**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the CDR dataset in detail. They describe it as being constructed using diverse glass types under various environmental conditions and divided into two parts based on the smoothness of reflection. This section provides context for the dataset's purpose and significance.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they trained their Reflection Prior Extraction Network (RPEN) on a combination of synthetic images and real images from the CDR dataset. This confirms the dataset's role in their experimental setup.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CDR dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **Categorized, Diverse, and Real-world (CDR) Dataset**:
  > Chenyang Lei, Xuhua Huang, Chenyang Qi, Yankun Zhao, Wenxiu Sun, Qiong Yan, and Qifeng Chen. *A categorized reflection removal dataset with diverse real-world scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3040–3048, 2022.

Additionally, the authors mention that they trained their RPEN on **7,643 synthetic images** created from the PASCAL VOC dataset and **614 real images** from the CDR training set. While the PASCAL VOC dataset is not the primary focus, it is important to note as it contributes to the synthetic dataset used.

The citation for the **PASCAL VOC dataset** is:
> Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88:303–338, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
