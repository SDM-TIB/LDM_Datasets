To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing UCB: a Better Local Search Strategy in Local Bayesian Optimization" by Zheyi Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. 

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets in the context of the experiments conducted with the proposed algorithms, MinUCB and LA-MinUCB. 

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

From my reading, I note the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **Synthetic Functions Dataset**: The authors mention using synthetic functions generated by sampling from a Gaussian Process (GP) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. However, this is more of a description of the experimental setup rather than a specific dataset with a formal citation.

2. **MuJoCo-based Locomotion Tasks**: The paper discusses experiments conducted on MuJoCo environments, specifically mentioning tasks like CartPole-v1, Swimmer-v1, and Hopper-v1. These tasks are commonly used benchmarks in reinforcement learning.

For the **MuJoCo-based tasks**, I will look for the original source or citation that describes these environments. The relevant citation is:

- For MuJoCo:
  > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026–5033, 2012.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their citations. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Synthetic Functions Dataset**: No formal citation, as it is generated for the experiments.
2. **MuJoCo-based Locomotion Tasks**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pages 5026–5033, 2012.

This structured approach ensures that I have accurately identified and cited the datasets used in the research paper.
