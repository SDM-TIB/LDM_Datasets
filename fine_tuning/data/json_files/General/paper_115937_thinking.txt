To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Interacting Variables for Generalized Linear Models via Neural Networks" by Yevhen Havrylenko and Julia Heger, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors provide results on "artificially generated data as well as open-source data." This indicates that there are at least two datasets to look for: one that is artificially generated and another that is open-source.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. The **case studies** section (Section 4) is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this section, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **Artificially Generated Dataset**: The authors describe how they created a dataset with 2 million observations, detailing the features and the data generation process. This dataset is crucial for validating their methodology.

2. **Open-source French MTPL Dataset**: The authors refer to the "freMTPL2freq" dataset, which is part of the R package CASdatasets. This dataset has been analyzed in various academic sources, indicating its relevance and credibility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **artificially generated dataset**, since it is created by the authors, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but can be described based on the details provided in the paper.

- For the **freMTPL2freq dataset**, I will look for the original source or reference that describes this dataset. The authors mention that it has been analyzed in several papers, and I will cite the primary reference they provide, which is:
  > Wüthrich, M.V., Merz, M. (2022). Statistical Foundations of Actuarial Learning and its Applications. Springer. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12409-9

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Artificially Generated Dataset**: 
   - Description: A dataset created by the authors containing 2 million observations with various features, used to validate their methodology.
   - Citation: Not applicable (created by authors).

2. **freMTPL2freq Dataset**: 
   - Description: An open-source dataset used for modeling insurance claim frequencies, analyzed in various academic sources.
   - Citation: Wüthrich, M.V., Merz, M. (2022). Statistical Foundations of Actuarial Learning and its Applications. Springer. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-12409-9

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are correctly formatted for inclusion in any further documentation or analysis.
