To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MUSCLE: A Model Update Strategy for Compatible LLM Evolution" by Jessica Echterhoff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe several datasets used for evaluating their model update strategy, specifically in the context of various tasks.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **HellaSwag**: This dataset is used for assessing common sense reasoning and predictive text modeling. The authors mention it in the context of evaluating model performance on tasks requiring real-world knowledge.

2. **PIQA**: This dataset tests understanding of physical interactions and is used to evaluate the model's reasoning capabilities in physical scenarios.

3. **GSM8k**: The Grade School Math 8K dataset is utilized to assess mathematical reasoning capabilities through grade school-level math word problems.

4. **SAMsum**: This dataset consists of dialogue summaries and is used to evaluate conversational summarization models.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **HellaSwag**, the citation is:
  > Zellers, R., Bisk, Y., Schwartz, R., & Choi, Y. (2018). *SWAG: A large-scale adversarial dataset for grounded commonsense inference*. In Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **PIQA**, the citation is:
  > Bisk, Y., Zellers, R., Le Bras, R., Gao, J., & Choi, Y. (2019). *PIQA: Reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language*. CoRR, abs/1911.11641.

- For **GSM8k**, the citation is:
  > Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., & Schulman, J. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. CoRR, abs/2110.14168.

- For **SAMsum**, the citation is:
  > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). *Samsum corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.12237.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
