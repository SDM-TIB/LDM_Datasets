To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fishr: Invariant Gradient Variances for Out-of-Distribution Generalization" by Alexandre RamÃ© et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method improves performance on the **DomainBed benchmark** and that they validate their approach on various datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention using the **Colored MNIST** dataset and the **DomainBed benchmark**. 

1. **Colored MNIST**: This dataset is a variant of the traditional MNIST dataset, where the digits are colored, and there is a correlation between color and label that is reversed at test time. The authors describe it in detail in section 4.1. 

2. **DomainBed Benchmark**: This benchmark includes multiple datasets for evaluating out-of-distribution generalization. The authors mention several datasets used in this benchmark, including:
   - **PACS**: A dataset consisting of images from four domains: art, cartoons, photos, and sketches.
   - **VLCS**: A dataset that includes images from four domains: Caltech101, LabelMe, SUN09, and VOC2007.
   - **OfficeHome**: A dataset with images from four domains: art, clipart, product, and real.
   - **TerraIncognita**: A dataset containing photographs of wild animals taken by camera traps.
   - **DomainNet**: A dataset with six domains: clipart, infograph, painting, quickdraw, real, and sketch.

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- **Colored MNIST**:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
