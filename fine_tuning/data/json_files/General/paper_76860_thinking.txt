To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Iterative Learning with Open-set Noisy Labels" by Yisen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments on **CIFAR-10, ImageNet**, and **real-world noisy datasets**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will delve into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In **section 4.1**, they specifically mention conducting experiments on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. They describe how they created open-set noisy datasets by mixing CIFAR-10 with images from other datasets, such as **CIFAR-100**, **ImageNet32**, and **SVHN**. This indicates that these datasets are also relevant to their experiments.

In **section 4.2**, the authors mention using the **ImageNet 2012 dataset**, which consists of 1.3 million images across 1000 classes. They describe how they generated an open-set noisy dataset from ImageNet by selecting images from 200 classes and mixing them with images from other classes.

In **section 4.3**, the authors discuss their experiments on a **real-world noisy dataset** obtained from Google image searches, which they used to evaluate their model's performance in a practical scenario.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper by consulting the **References section**:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

4. **SVHN Dataset**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

5. **Real-world noisy dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the web-search dataset, as it is derived from Google image searches using queries from various datasets.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
