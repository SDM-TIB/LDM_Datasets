To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Neural Machine Translation with Pre-trained Representation" by Rongxiang Weng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on Chinese-English, German-English, and English-Turkish translation tasks, which suggests that there are datasets associated with these language pairs.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 3) to find detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors specify the datasets for each translation task:

1. **Chinese-English (ZH→EN)**: The training set consists of about 1 million sentence pairs from LDC, with specific validation and test sets mentioned (MT02, MT03, MT04, MT05).

2. **German-English (DE→EN)**: The training set is from WMT-16, containing about 4.5 million sentence pairs, with validation and test sets (newstest2015 and newstest2016).

3. **English-Turkish (EN→TR)**: The training set also comes from WMT-16, with about 0.2 million sentence pairs, and validation and test sets (newsdev2016 and newstest2016).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are typically found in the context of the papers or resources that introduced them. 

For the datasets mentioned:

- For the **LDC datasets** used in the Chinese-English task, I will look for the specific LDC reference that includes the sentence pairs. This might be a report or a dataset description from LDC.

- For the **WMT datasets**, I will refer to the WMT conference proceedings or the official WMT website for the correct citation format.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations correctly according to the conventions used in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
