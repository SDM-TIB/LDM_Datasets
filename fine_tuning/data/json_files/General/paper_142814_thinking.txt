To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DmADs-Net: Dense multiscale attention and depth-supervised network for medical image segmentation" by Zhaojin Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their network using five datasets of varying sizes and types, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention five datasets:

1. **ISIC2016**: This dataset is designed for skin lesion detection and contains a rich collection of skin lesion samples at a resolution of 256×256 pixels.

2. **JSRT**: This dataset consists of human chest images obtained through X-ray scanning, containing lung images with a resolution of 256×256 pixels.

3. **DSB2018**: This dataset encompasses a wide range of cell imaging samples, also with a resolution of 256×256 pixels, and is rich in features.

4. **BUSI**: Created for breast cancer treatment, this dataset includes samples from 600 female patients, classified into normal, benign, and malignant categories, with a resolution of 256×256 pixels.

5. **GlaS**: This dataset contains samples of cell sections from colon lesions, with the sample size adjusted to 128×128 pixels.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **ISIC2016**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
