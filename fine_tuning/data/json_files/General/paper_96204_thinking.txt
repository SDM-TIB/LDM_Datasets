To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-assisted Democratized Learning Towards Federated Analytics" by Shashi Raj Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "extensive simulation results on real datasets," which indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they performed simulations on well-known datasets: **MNIST**, **FEMNIST**, and **Fashion-MNIST**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **FEMNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Shardlow, T., Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečny, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., and Talwalkar, A. *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. arXiv:1812.01097, 2018.

3. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
- MNIST Dataset with its citation.
- FEMNIST Dataset with its citation.
- Fashion-MNIST Dataset with its citation.

This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately for further processing or review.
