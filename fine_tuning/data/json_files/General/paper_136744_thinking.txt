To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Early Detection of Hallucinations in Factual Question Answering" by Marius Moisescu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "two QA datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **T-REx Dataset**: This dataset consists of relationship triplets that include pairs of entities and their relationships. The authors specify that they focus on three categories: Capitals, Founders, and Places of Birth. They also provide examples of questions derived from this dataset.

2. **TriviaQA Dataset**: This dataset is described as a reading comprehension dataset containing trivia question, answer, and evidence tuples. The authors clarify that they only use the closed book setting, where the model is provided with questions without any supporting information.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For the **T-REx Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hady Elsahar, Pavlos Vougiouklis, Arslen Remaci, Christophe Gravier, Jonathon Hare, Frederique Laforest, and Elena Simperl. *T-REx: a large scale alignment of natural language with knowledge base triples*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018), pages 1544–1550, 2018.

- For the **TriviaQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *TriviaQA: a large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601–1611, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
