To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ShelfNet for Fast Semantic Segmentation" by Juntang Zhuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to their validation of ShelfNet on three benchmark datasets: **PASCAL VOC**, **PASCAL Context**, and **Cityscapes**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: This dataset contains 20 object classes plus one background class, with a total of 10,582 training images, 1,449 validation images, and 1,456 test images. The authors also mention using the augmented version of this dataset.

2. **PASCAL-Context**: This dataset offers dense labels for the entire image, consisting of 59 classes plus a background class. It includes 4,998 training images and 5,105 test images.

3. **Cityscapes**: This dataset comprises images from 50 cities, annotated with 19 categories. It contains 2,975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1,525 test images, along with over 20,000 images with coarse annotations.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 111(1):98–136, 2015.

- For **PASCAL-Context**, the citation is:
  > R. Mottaghi, X. Chen, X. Liu, N.-G. Cho, S.-W. Lee, S. Fidler, R. Urtasun, and A. Yuille. *The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 891–898, 2014.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used in the research.
