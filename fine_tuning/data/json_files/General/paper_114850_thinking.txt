To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HVS-Inspired Signal Degradation Network for Just Noticeable Difference Estimation" by Jian Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of two datasets, **COCO2017** and **CSIQ**, which indicates that these are relevant for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that images from the **COCO2017** dataset are used for training the HVS-SD and HVS-SD-JND networks, while the **CSIQ** dataset is used for testing the well-trained HVS-SD-JND model. This confirms the datasets' roles in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **COCO2017**, the citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014, pp. 740–755.

2. For **CSIQ**, the citation is:
   > E. C. Larson and D. Chandler. *Categorical Image Quality (CSIQ) Database*, 2010.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for clarity and proper attribution.
