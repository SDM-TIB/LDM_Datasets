To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Eating Events in Free Living Individuals" by Jiayi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and mentions that data was collected from 81 individuals using various sensors, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, specifically the parts that describe the data collection process. The authors mention that data was collected using accelerometers, GPS, and body-worn cameras (SenseCam) over a week-long period. This indicates that the dataset consists of sensor data from these devices.

In the **data section**, the authors provide detailed information about the participants and the data collected. They mention that a sub-sample of 81 participants was selected from a larger cohort of 216 individuals. The data includes minute-level features generated from the sensors, which confirms that there is a structured dataset available for analysis.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets used for training and testing their models. They mention using data from the 81 individuals, which includes 596,771 data points. This reinforces the existence of a dataset derived from the sensor data.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or tools mentioned. The authors reference the use of the SenseCam, which is a specific tool used for data collection. However, they do not provide a formal dataset citation since the data is original to their study.

Based on the information gathered, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset from SenseCam and other sensors**: This dataset includes minute-level data collected from 81 participants using accelerometers, GPS, and SenseCam over a week. It contains features related to eating and food purchasing behaviors.

Since the dataset is original and not publicly available, I will note that in the citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the necessary details about the dataset and its origin.
