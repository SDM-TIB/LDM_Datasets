To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallax-tolerant Image Stitching via Segmentation-guided Multi-homography Warping" by Tianli Liao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "comprehensive experimental results on the public datasets demonstrate that our method provides the best alignment accuracy." This indicates that datasets are used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors mention conducting comparative experiments on "a variety of existing available datasets with large parallax, including 35 image pairs from Parallax, 24 image pairs from SEAGULL, and 14 image pairs from MR." This provides me with the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail:

1. **Parallax Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Fan Zhang and Feng Liu. *Parallax-tolerant image stitching*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3262–3269, 2014.

2. **SEAGULL Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Kaimo Lin, Nianjuan Jiang, Loong-Fah Cheong, Minh Do, and Jiangbo Lu. *Seagull: Seam-guided local alignment for parallax-tolerant image stitching*. In Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 370–385, 2016.

3. **MR Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Charles Herrmann, Chen Wang, Richard Strong Bowen, Emil Keyder, Michael Krainin, Ce Liu, and Ramin Zabih. *Robust image stitching with multiple registrations*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 53–67, 2018.

With these citations, I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
