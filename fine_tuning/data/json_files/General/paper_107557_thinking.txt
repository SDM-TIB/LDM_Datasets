To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Hybrid and Passive RIS-Assisted Beamforming for MmWave MIMO Systems Relying on Dynamically Configured Subarrays" by Chenghao Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may reference existing datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors include a section that explicitly lists the datasets used, along with descriptions of their characteristics, such as size, type, and any relevant metrics. This section is crucial for identifying the datasets utilized in their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important because proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research or verification.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. The citation should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
