To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FastKAN: Accelerating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" by Ziyao Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that FastKAN is evaluated on the **MNIST dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will examine **section 4.2 (Accuracy)**, where the author discusses the accuracy test conducted on the MNIST dataset. The author states that "the accuracy test is conducted on the MNIST dataset provided by torchvision." This confirms that MNIST is indeed the dataset used for evaluation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically found in literature discussing it. The standard citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper only mentions the MNIST dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for MNIST, ensuring it is ready for any further processing or review.
