To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEEPM: A DEEP PART-BASED MODEL FOR OBJECT DETECTION AND SEMANTIC PART LOCALIZATION" by Jun Zhu, Xianjie Chen, and Alan L. Yuille, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors annotated semantic parts for all 20 object categories on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors discuss their evaluation methods and mention the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset** again, confirming its significance in their experiments. They also refer to the annotations they created for semantic parts on this dataset, which is essential for understanding their methodology.

In the **related work section**, the authors reference previous works that utilized the PASCAL VOC dataset, further solidifying its importance in the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C. K. I., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately for future reference.
