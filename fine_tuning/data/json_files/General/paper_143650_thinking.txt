To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the use of a Large Language Model for data extraction in systematic reviews: a rapid feasibility study," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study involved using a large language model (LLM) to extract data from various studies, which suggests that datasets may be referenced. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly the subsections that describe the studies used for prompt development and evaluation. The authors mention using two feasibility studies: one for extracting study characteristics from human clinical, animal, and social science studies, and another for predicting PICO (Participants, Interventions, Controls, Outcomes) entities from the EBM-NLP dataset. This indicates that at least two datasets are involved.

In the **comparative study subsection**, the authors describe how they selected studies from three domains: human social science, human clinical, and animal research. They mention that they retrieved 12 studies from the Development Evidence Portal for human social science, 6 animal studies from PubMed, and 12 human clinical studies from PubMed. However, they do not provide specific dataset names for these collections, so I will note that they are sourced from established databases.

In the **PICO study subsection**, the authors explicitly mention using the **EBM-NLP dataset**, which contains titles and abstracts from 5000 human clinical trials. This dataset is crucial for my extraction.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The EBM-NLP dataset citation is as follows:
- For the **EBM-NLP dataset**:
  > Nye, B., et al. (2018). A Corpus with Multi-Level Annotations of Patients, Interventions and Outcomes to Support Language Processing for Medical Literature. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 197â€“207. Available: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6174533/

For the other studies mentioned in the comparative study, while they are not named as datasets, I will note that they were sourced from the Development Evidence Portal and PubMed, which are reputable databases for research studies.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
