To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Unconventional Preprocessors in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Face Identification" by Chollette C. Olisah and Lyndon Smith, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on preprocessing methods, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for face recognition tasks. The authors describe it as containing 13,233 face images of 5,749 individuals, emphasizing its relevance due to intra-class variability.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LFW dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> G. Huang, M. Mattar, H. Lee, and E. G. Learned-Miller. "Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments." In Workshop on faces in 'Real-Life' Images: detection, alignment, and recognition, Oct. 2008.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the LFW dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will involve summarizing the dataset's characteristics and its relevance to the study.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the LFW dataset, ready for further processing or review.
