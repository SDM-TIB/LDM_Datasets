To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Free-form 3D Scene Inpainting with Dual-stream GAN" by Ru-Fen Jheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract introduces a novel dataset called **FF-Matterport**, which is specifically designed for the task of free-form 3D scene inpainting. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the FF-Matterport dataset in detail in **section 3.1 (Free-form 3D Dataset Generation)**. Here, they explain how the dataset was generated using a novel 3D mask generation algorithm and that it is based on the **Matterport3D** dataset.

The FF-Matterport dataset is characterized by containing 30-40% missing regions in indoor scenes, which are voxelized to 2cm grids. This section provides essential details about the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Matterport3D dataset, as it is the foundational dataset used to create FF-Matterport. The citation for the Matterport3D dataset is:

- **Matterport3D Dataset**:
  > Angel Chang, Angela Dai, Thomas Funkhouser, Maciej Halber, Matthias Niessner, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Andy Zeng, and Yinda Zhang. *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158, 2017.

Since the FF-Matterport dataset is derived from the Matterport3D dataset, I will also include its citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that full citations are included for both the FF-Matterport and Matterport3D datasets. This will ensure that the information is comprehensive and ready for further processing or review.
