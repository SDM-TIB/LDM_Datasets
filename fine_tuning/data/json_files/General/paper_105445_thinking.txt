To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modeling of Frequency Security Constraints and Quantification of Frequency Control Reserve Requirements for Unit Commitment" by Likai Liu and Zechun Hu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or historical data used for their analysis. They mention using historical operation data, which is a good indication that there are datasets involved.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. The authors mention using historical data from a practical power system in North China, which suggests that there is a specific dataset they are referring to.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional information about the datasets, such as how they were processed or analyzed, and whether any specific datasets are highlighted in the context of the results.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to datasets from other studies or sources, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

For example, if I identify a dataset from the paper, I will note its name, description, and the full citation. If the authors used historical data from a specific study, I will find that study's citation and include it.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets extracted from the paper, complete with full citations for each one.
