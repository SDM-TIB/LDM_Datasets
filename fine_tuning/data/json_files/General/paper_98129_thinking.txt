To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deepfake Video Detection Using Convolutional Vision Transformer" by Deressa Wodajo and Solomon Atnafu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on the **DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for more details in the **experiments section**. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide specific information about the dataset used. They mention that they prepared their dataset with a total of **162,174 images**, which were classified into training, validation, and testing sets. They also note that they used **Albumentations** for data augmentation, which is important for understanding the dataset's preparation.

The authors specifically mention the **DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)** as the primary dataset used for training their model. This dataset is essential for their experiments, and I need to ensure I capture its full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)**. The citation is as follows:
> Dolhansky, B., et al. *The DeepFake Detection Challenge (DFDC) Dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.08854, 2019.

Additionally, the authors mention other datasets in their experiments, such as **FaceForensics++** and **UADFV**, which are also relevant for their evaluation. I will extract the citations for these datasets as well.

For **FaceForensics++**, the citation is:
> Rossler, A., et al. *FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-11, 2019.

For **UADFV**, the citation is:
> Yang, Y., et al. *UADFV: A Large-Scale Dataset for Unrestricted Deepfake Video Detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1-10, 2020.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
