To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In Situ Cane Toad Recognition" by Dmitry A. Konovalov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing cane toads, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the invasive nature of cane toads and hints at the use of video clips for training the CNN.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly **section II.A (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that motion-activated video cameras were deployed to capture video clips of cane toads and native frogs. They specify the number of clips and the species involved, which is crucial for dataset identification.

The authors detail that they identified cane toads in **33 video clips with plain backgrounds** and **12 video clips with complex backgrounds**. They also mention the specific native frog species used for testing the visual recognition system, including the water-holding frog, green tree frog, motorbike frog, and blue-tongue lizard. This information is essential for understanding the dataset composition.

The total number of toad and not-toad video clips is provided: **45 toad clips** and **64 not-toad clips**. They extracted frames from these clips, resulting in **454 toad images** and **669 not-toad images**. The authors also mention that they manually segmented the toads in the images, which is relevant for dataset creation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the video clips used. Instead, it references the methodology and the species involved, which may not correspond to a formal dataset citation.

Since the authors do not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Cane Toad Dataset**: Comprises video clips of cane toads captured in the wild, specifically **33 clips with plain backgrounds** and **12 clips with complex backgrounds**. The dataset includes **454 images** of cane toads extracted from these clips.

2. **Native Frog Dataset**: Includes video clips of native frog species used for testing, specifically:
   - Water-holding frog (Cyclorana platycephala): 20 clips (plain) and 4 clips (complex).
   - Green tree frog (Litoria caerulea): 12 clips (plain) and 4 clips (complex).
   - Motorbike frog (Litoria moorei): 8 clips (plain) and 3 clips (complex).
   - Blue-tongue lizard (Tiliqua scincoides): 9 clips (complex) and 4 clips (plain).
   The dataset includes **669 images** of not-toad species extracted from these clips.

Since there are no formal citations provided for these datasets in the paper, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' own video recordings and segmentation efforts.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the lack of formal citations while summarizing the dataset details accurately.
