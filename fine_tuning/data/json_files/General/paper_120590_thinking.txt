To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDColor: Towards Photo-Realistic and Semantic-Aware Image Colorization via Dual Decoders" by Xiaoyang Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's performance on public benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for validation and testing. In this section, they state that they validate their model on **ImageNet**, **COCO-Stuff**, and **ADE20K** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the paper. The authors mention:

1. **ImageNet**: A widely used dataset in computer vision, consisting of 1.3 million images across various categories. The specific reference to ImageNet indicates its significance in the evaluation of their method.

2. **COCO-Stuff**: This dataset contains a wide variety of natural images and is used for testing without fine-tuning. The authors specify that they test on the 5,000 images of the original validation set.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is composed of scene-centric images with large diversity. The authors mention testing on the 2,000 images of the validation set without fine-tuning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **COCO-Stuff**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 1209–1218, 2018.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene parsing through ade20k dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 633–641, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
