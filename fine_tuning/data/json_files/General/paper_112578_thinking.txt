To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MET: Masked Encoding for Tabular Data" by Kushal Majmundar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted empirical results on **five diverse tabular datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section 5.3 (Datasets)**. Here, they describe the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Permuted MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 28x28 dimensional images, flattened to 784 coordinates. The classification task has ten classes, with a standard split of 60,000 training entries and 10,000 test entries.

2. **Permuted Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST)**: Similar to MNIST, this dataset consists of Zalandoâ€™s article images, also flattened to 784 coordinates, with ten classes and the same training/test split as MNIST.

3. **Permuted CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 color images of size 32x32, belonging to ten different classes. The images are flattened to 3072 coordinates, with a split of 50,000 training entries and 10,000 test entries.

4. **Forest CoverType (CovType)**: A UCI dataset used to predict forest cover type based on cartographic variables. It consists of 54 features and is a 7-class classification problem, with a split of 11,340 training entries and 565,892 test entries.

5. **Adult Income (Income)**: Another UCI dataset where the task is to predict whether a person earns over $50K a year based on census data. It consists of 14 features, with a split of 30,162 training entries and 15,060 test entries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the UCI datasets are typically found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, while the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets have established citations in the literature.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Obermayer. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Forest CoverType**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017.

- For **Adult Income**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 2017.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
