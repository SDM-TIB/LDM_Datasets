To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAST-VQA: Efficient End-to-end Video Quality Assessment with Fragment Sampling" by Haoning Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the need for efficient video quality assessment methods and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation. The introduction will provide more context about the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, there is a reference to a table (Table 1) that lists common VQA datasets and their sizes. This is a crucial point as it likely contains the datasets used for the experiments.

Upon examining Table 1, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **KoNViD-1k**: This dataset is noted as an in-the-wild video quality assessment dataset containing 1,200 videos.
2. **LIVE-VQC**: Another in-the-wild dataset with 585 videos.
3. **LSVQ**: A large-scale VQA dataset with 39,076 videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **KoNViD-1k**:

- For **LIVE-VQC**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future references or applications. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately.
