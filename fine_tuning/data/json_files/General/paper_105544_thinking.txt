To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Operator Theoretic View on Pruning Deep Neural Networks" by William T. Redman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of pruning algorithms but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of deep neural network (DNN) pruning but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be mentioned.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors mention using **MnistNet** and **ResNet-20**, which are models trained on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, respectively. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits, widely used for training various image processing systems.
2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, commonly used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
