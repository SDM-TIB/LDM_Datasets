To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Face Transfer with Generative Adversarial Network" by Runze Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the methodology and context of face transfer but does not specify datasets either. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used for the experiments. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on three specific video clips:

1. **Barack Obama in weekly address**
2. **Joe Biden in weekly address**
3. **Li Xiuping in CCTV News**

These clips are described as being manually cropped and extracted for the purpose of the study. The authors explain that these videos were chosen because they feature characters talking to the camera, which is essential for the face transfer task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are not traditional datasets with published citations, I will note that they are specific video clips rather than datasets that can be cited in the conventional sense. Therefore, I will provide a description of each video clip as the dataset entry.

The entries for the datasets will be as follows:

1. **Barack Obama in weekly address**: A video clip featuring Barack Obama delivering a weekly address, used as the source video for face transfer.

2. **Joe Biden in weekly address**: A video clip featuring Joe Biden delivering a weekly address, used as the source video for face transfer.

3. **Li Xiuping in CCTV News**: A video clip featuring Li Xiuping presenting news on CCTV, used as the target video for face transfer.

Since these clips do not have formal citations like traditional datasets, I will note that they are sourced from publicly available video content.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of the datasets used in the study.
