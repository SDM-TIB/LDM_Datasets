To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Image Super Resolution based on a Modified U-net with Mixed Gradient Loss" by Zhengyang Lu and Ying Chen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method yields high-level results on three image datasets: **SET14, BSD300, and ICDAR2003**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **ICDAR2003**: This dataset is part of the ICDAR Robust Reading Competition for text detection and recognition tasks. It consists of 258 training images and 249 testing images, with varying resolutions that are resized to 224×224 for the experiments.

2. **SET14**: This dataset is mentioned as a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating super-resolution methods, but specific details about its composition are not provided in this section.

3. **BSD300**: Similar to SET14, BSD300 is referenced as another standard benchmark dataset for super-resolution tasks, but again, specific details are not elaborated upon.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used **SET14**, **BSD300**, and **ICDAR2003** for their evaluations, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ICDAR2003**, the citation is:
  > D. Karatzas, F. Shafait, S. Uchida, M. Iwamura, L. G. i Bigorda, S. R. Mestre, J. Mas, D. F. Mota, J. A. Almazan, and L. P. De Las Heras. *ICDAR 2013 Robust Reading Competition*. In 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1484–1493, IEEE, 2013.

- For **SET14**, the citation is:
  > M. Bevilacqua, A. Roumy, C. Guillemot, and M. L. Alberi-Morel. *Low-complexity single-image super-resolution based on nonnegative neighbor embedding*. 2012.

- For **BSD300**, the citation is:
  > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In ICCV Vancouver, 2001.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
