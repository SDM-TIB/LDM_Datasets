To extract datasets from the research paper titled "De-confounded Data-free Knowledge Distillation for Handling Distribution Shifts" by Yuzheng Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to find any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on several classification datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Models)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples of 32x32 resolution images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples, but it has 100 classes.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 100,000 training samples, 10,000 validating samples, and 10,000 testing samples of 64x64 resolution images across 200 classes.
4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with 1.28 million training samples and 50,000 validating samples across 1,000 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
