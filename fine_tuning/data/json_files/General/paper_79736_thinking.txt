To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Theano-MPI: a Theano-based Distributed Training Framework" by He Ma, Fei Mao, and Graham W. Taylor, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a training framework but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and benchmarking sections**. These sections often contain details about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **ImageNet** for benchmarking their framework. This is a significant dataset in the field of deep learning, particularly for image classification tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation for ImageNet is:

- **ImageNet**: 
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., et al. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 115(3), 211â€“252, 2015.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference **CIFAR** and **MS-COCO** in the introduction as examples of large datasets that challenge AI research, but they do not indicate that these datasets were used in their experiments.

After confirming that **ImageNet** is the primary dataset used for evaluation in this paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for **ImageNet** with the necessary details, ready for downstream processing or review.
