To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HAT-GAE: Self-Supervised Graph Auto-encoders with Hierarchical Adaptive Masking and Trainable Corruption" by Chengyu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experimentation on **ten benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used. They mention using **seven widely-used datasets** for transductive node classification and **three large-scale datasets** for inductive node classification. This section will likely contain the names and descriptions of the datasets.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the statistics of the datasets, including the number of nodes, edges, features, classes, and categories. The datasets listed are:

1. **Cora**: A citation network with 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, and 7 classes.
2. **Citeseer**: A citation network with 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, and 6 classes.
3. **Pubmed**: A citation network with 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, and 3 classes.
4. **Amazon-Photo**: A co-purchase network with 7,650 nodes, 119,081 edges, 745 features, and 8 classes.
5. **Amazon-Computer**: A co-purchase network with 13,752 nodes, 245,861 edges, 767 features, and 10 classes.
6. **Coauthor-CS**: An academic network with 18,333 nodes, 81,894 edges, 6,805 features, and 15 classes.
7. **Coauthor-Physics**: An academic network with 34,493 nodes, 247,962 edges, 8,415 features, and 5 classes.
8. **Ogbn-arxiv**: A citation network with 169,343 nodes, 1,166,243 edges, 128 features, and 40 classes.
9. **PPI**: A biological protein-protein interaction network with 56,944 nodes, 818,716 edges, 50 features, and 121 classes.
10. **Reddit**: A social network with 231,443 nodes, 11,606,919 edges, 602 features, and 41 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not be explicitly listed for each dataset, but I can infer them based on the context provided in the paper and the common knowledge surrounding these datasets.

For example, the citations for the datasets might look like this:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
