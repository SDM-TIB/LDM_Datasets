To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hyperparameter Optimization via Sequential Uniform Designs" by Zebin Yang and Aijun Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) and the **hyperparameter optimization section** (Section 6). These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about the dataset names, sizes, and characteristics.

In Section 6.1 (Experimental Setup), the authors mention using **20 regression and 20 binary classification datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning repository and OpenML platform**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to extract their names and any relevant details.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional information or datasets that may not have been included in the main text. Sometimes, supplementary materials contain important details about datasets used in the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of features, number of instances).
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if I find that one of the datasets is the "California Housing" dataset, I will note its description and citation as follows:
- **California Housing Dataset**: A dataset for regression tasks containing information about housing in California, including features like median income and housing prices.
- Citation: > Pace, R. K., & Gilley, O. W. (1997). *Using the spatial structure of the data to improve estimation of the parameters of the hedonic price model*. Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics, 14(3), 327-347.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation. This structured approach will help in accurately representing the datasets used in the research paper.
