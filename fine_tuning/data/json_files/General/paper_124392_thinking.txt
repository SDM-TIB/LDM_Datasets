To extract datasets from the master's thesis titled "Spatial Latent Representations in Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation" by Maciej Sypetkowski, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, related works, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the thesis, and the introduction typically outlines the contributions and context, which may include references to datasets.

In the **related works section**, the author discusses various GAN architectures and their applications, which may lead to mentions of datasets used in previous research. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are cited or described.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section (2.4)**, where the author explicitly lists and describes the datasets used in the research. Here, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ)**: This dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality images of human faces at a resolution of 1024x1024. It includes variations in age, ethnicity, background, and accessories. The dataset was crawled from Flickr and the images are aligned and cropped consistently.

2. **LSUN (Large-scale Scene Understanding)**: This dataset contains 10 scene categories, such as dining rooms and outdoor churches, with a considerable number of images per category, ranging from around 120,000 to 3,000,000 images. The images are of size 256x256.

3. **SpaceNet**: This dataset consists of satellite imagery, containing around 67,000 square kilometers of high-resolution imagery, over 11 million building footprints, and 20,000 kilometers of road labels. It features various areas of interest, including cities like Rio de Janeiro and Paris, and provides multiple types of image representations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **bibliography section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **Flickr-Faces-HQ**:
  > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **LSUN**:
  > Yu, F., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Seff, A., & Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a Large-scale Image Dataset using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop*. CoRR, abs/1506.03365.

- For **SpaceNet**:
  > SpaceNet on Amazon Web Services (AWS). (2018). *SpaceNet Dataset*. Retrieved from https://spacenet.ai/datasets/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
