To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ActiveGuard: An Active DNN IP Protection Technique via Adversarial Examples" by Mingfu Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the experiments were conducted on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which indicates that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will verify the details of these datasets in the **experimental setup section**. The authors describe the **MNIST dataset** as containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, with a total of 10 classes (0-9). The **CIFAR-10 dataset** is described as consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 classes (Airplane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck).

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
