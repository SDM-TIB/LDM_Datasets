To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multilingual Irony Detection with Dependency Syntax and Neural Models" by Alessandra Teresa Cignarella et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using datasets from previous shared tasks on irony detection in multiple languages, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Data and Experimental Setting)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets corresponding to different languages:

1. **SemEval-2018 Task 3**: This dataset is used for irony detection in English tweets.
2. **IroSvA 2019**: This dataset is for irony detection in Spanish variants.
3. **DEFT 2017**: This dataset is for irony detection in French.
4. **IronITA 2018**: This dataset is for irony detection in Italian.

In this section, the authors provide details about the number of instances in each dataset, which is useful for understanding the scale of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **SemEval-2018 Task 3**, the citation is:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for any further analysis or replication of the study.
