To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Color-Emotion Associations in Art: Fuzzy Approach" by Muragul Muratbekova and Pakizar Shamoi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilize the **Wiki Art Dataset** for their analysis, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look into **section III (Methods)**, where the authors describe their methodology. Here, they explicitly mention the **Wiki Art Dataset** again, detailing that it contains works from 195 artists, with a total of 42,129 images for training and 10,628 images for testing. This section also explains how the dataset is annotated with emotions, which is crucial for understanding its application in the study.

In **Table I**, the authors provide a distribution of emotions in the dataset, which further confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Wiki Art Dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Mohammad, S. M., & Kiritchenko, S. (2015). *WikiArt Emotions: An Annotated Dataset of Emotions Evoked by Art*. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as it is critical for proper attribution and further research.

In conclusion, I have identified the **Wiki Art Dataset** as the primary dataset used in the study, and I have gathered all necessary details to create a comprehensive entry for it.
