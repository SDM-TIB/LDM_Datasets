To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Application of Deep Learning in Neuroradiology: Automated Detection of Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage using 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks" by Vishal Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's purpose and methods, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of detecting basal ganglia hemorrhage and may mention datasets used in prior studies or their own. This section will help me understand the context and importance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the subsection labeled "Datasets." Here, the authors describe how they obtained their data. They mention that they used **170 unique de-identified HIPAA-compliant noncontrast head CTs** from Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, which is crucial information. They further detail how these were split into training, validation, and test datasets, specifying the number of cases with and without hemorrhage.

The paper states that **110 cases were held out for testing**, with **60 cases split into training (45) and validation (15)**. This breakdown is essential for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also note that the authors performed **data augmentation** to increase the training dataset size, which is relevant for understanding the dataset's final composition.

After gathering this information, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the paper does not cite external datasets but rather describes the dataset they created from their own institution's data.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage Dataset**: This dataset consists of 170 unique noncontrast head CT scans, with 110 used for testing and 60 for training and validation. The training set includes cases of right and left basal ganglia hemorrhage and cases without hemorrhage.

Since the dataset is derived from the authors' own research and does not have an external citation, I will note that the dataset is specific to this study and does not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the details about the dataset's origin and structure.
