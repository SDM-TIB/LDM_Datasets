To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anytime Learning at Macroscale" by Lucas Caccia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for experiments. 

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they will analyze several deep learning models using classic computer vision benchmarks and a large-scale language modeling task. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets in detail. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images of size 32x32 pixels across 10 classes. The authors use this dataset for evaluating their models.

2. **MNIST**: This dataset includes 60,000 training examples of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels) and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks.

3. **Common Crawl**: The authors describe a portion of the English language text from the Common Crawl dataset, which consists of Books, Wikipedia, and other sources. They mention using large mega-batches for training and a validation set for model selection.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, technical report, 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

- For **Common Crawl**, the citation is:
  > Common Crawl. *The Common Crawl Dataset*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
