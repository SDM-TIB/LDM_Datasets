To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depressive, Drug Abusive, or Informative: Knowledge-aware Study of News Exposure during COVID-19 Outbreak" by Amanuel Alambo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on news articles related to COVID-19, which suggests that datasets of news articles are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the impact of media exposure on mental health, which indicates that they may have collected specific datasets related to news articles and mental health metrics. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **data collection section**. Here, the authors state that they collected **1.2 million news articles from the Web and GDELT** (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone) using semantic filtering. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, in the **methods section**, the authors mention using two specific corpora for fine-tuning their BERT models: 

1. **Subreddit Depression**: This dataset consists of 760,049 posts across 121,795 Redditors, collected from the years 2005 to 2016.
2. **COOA (Crippling Alcoholism, Opiates, Opiates Recovery, and Addiction)**: This dataset contains 1,416,765 posts from 46,183 users, also from the years 2005 to 2016.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GDELT** dataset, the citation is:
  > GDELT. "GDELT: Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone." Available at: https://www.gdeltproject.org/

- For the **Subreddit Depression** dataset, the citation is:
  > Gkotsis, George, et al. "Characterisation of mental health conditions in social media using Informed Deep Learning." *Scientific Reports* 7 (2017): 45141.

- For the **COOA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gaur, Manas, et al. "Knowledge-infused Deep Learning." In *Proceedings of the 31st ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media*, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately and comprehensively.
