To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hue Modification Localization By Pair Matching" by Quoc-Tin Phan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a Siamese neural network for detecting hue modifications, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of image manipulation but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section III) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for testing. Here, I find that the authors generated their own datasets for the experiments, as they state: "to evaluate our method, we generated the test set from 120 raw images of an external Canon 600D camera." This indicates that the datasets are not publicly available but are instead created by the authors.

The paper describes three specific datasets generated for testing:
1. **Dα_png**: This dataset consists of uncompressed images that were demosaiced from raw images and subjected to local hue modification. The authors used 120 uncompressed images for this dataset.
2. **Dα_jpg**: This dataset includes images that were modified by different angles of hue modification and then compressed using JPEG compression with varying quality factors.
3. **DQF_a_jpg**: This dataset consists of images that were first compressed and then subjected to hue modification, followed by a second JPEG compression.

Since these datasets are generated by the authors and not publicly available, I will note that in the dataset descriptions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets are based on existing datasets or if they reference any foundational work. However, the datasets mentioned are original to this study and do not have external citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the descriptions and the fact that these datasets are not publicly available. The full citations for the datasets will reflect that they are generated by the authors of this paper.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:
1. **Dα_png**: Generated from 120 raw images of a Canon 600D camera, subjected to local hue modification.
2. **Dα_jpg**: Images modified by hue adjustments and compressed using JPEG.
3. **DQF_a_jpg**: Images first compressed and then modified by hue adjustments.

I will ensure to note that these datasets are not publicly available and are original to the authors' research.
