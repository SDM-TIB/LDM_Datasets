To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Sequences of Training Runs" by Xingyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental framework sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses knowledge distillation (KD) but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction also focuses on the methodology and the problem being addressed without naming datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental framework section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using **CIFAR-100** as the benchmark dataset for training their models. This is a significant dataset in the context of their experiments, so I will take note of it.

In the **conclusions section**, the authors summarize their findings but do not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will confirm that the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper is CIFAR-100.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CIFAR-100 dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is typically included in the literature. However, since it is not directly cited in this paper, I will provide the standard citation for CIFAR-100:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the only dataset extracted from the paper is CIFAR-100, and its citation is provided. This will be ready for any downstream processing or documentation needs.
