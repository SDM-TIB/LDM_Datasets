To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ex uno plures: Splitting One Model into an Ensemble of Subnetworks" by Zhilu Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method using several computer vision datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **CUB-200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 dataset, which contains 11,788 images of birds across 200 species.
4. **Tiny-Imagenet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CUB-200**, the citation is:
  > P. Welinder, S. Branson, T. Mita, C. Wah, F. Schroff, S. Belongie, and P. Perona. *Caltech-UCSD Birds 200*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology, 2010.

- For **Tiny-Imagenet**, the citation is:
  > Tiny ImageNet. *https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet*.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
