To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamically Decoding Source Domain Knowledge for Domain Generalization" by Cuicui Kang and Karthik Nandakumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method has been evaluated on three benchmarks in the domain generalization field, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset contains 9,991 images across four domains: Photo, Art Painting, Cartoon, and Sketch, with seven categories in total. The authors reference the original work by Li et al. (2017) for more details.

2. **Office-Home Dataset**: This dataset consists of around 15,500 images from 65 categories, divided into four domains: Art, Clipart, Product, and Real-World. The authors cite Venkateswara et al. (2017) for this dataset.

3. **VLCS Dataset**: This dataset includes 10,729 images from five object categories shared by PASCAL VOC 2007, Labelme, CALTECH, and SUN databases. The authors refer to the original work by Torralba and Efros (2011) for more information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PACS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Da Li, Yongxin Yang, Yi-Zhe Song, and Timothy M. Hospedales. *Deeper, Broader and Artier Domain Generalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 5543–5551, 2017.

- For **Office-Home Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hemanth Venkateswara, Jose Eusebio, Shayok Chakraborty, and Sethuraman Panchanathan. *Deep Hashing Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5018–5027, 2017.

- For **VLCS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Antonio Torralba and Alexei A. Efros. *Unbiased Look at Dataset Bias*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1521–1528, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
