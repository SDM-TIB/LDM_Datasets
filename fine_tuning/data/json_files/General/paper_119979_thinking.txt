To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ZeroKBC: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Zero-Shot Knowledge Base Completion" by Pei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the development of a benchmark called **ZeroKBC**, which suggests that there are datasets involved in this benchmark.

Next, I will focus on **section V (A Comprehensive Benchmark Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used to construct the ZeroKBC benchmark. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **WN18RR**: This dataset is a subset of WordNet that includes eleven relations. It is used for linguistic knowledge in the context of knowledge base completion.

2. **FB15K-237**: This dataset is a subset of Freebase that contains 15,000 entities and 237 relations. It is utilized for world knowledge in the benchmark.

3. **ATOMIC**: This dataset includes commonsense knowledge and consists of nine relations. It is also part of the ZeroKBC benchmark.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **WN18RR**, the citation is:
  > Dettmers, T., Minervini, P., Stenetorp, P., & Riedel, S. (2018). Convolutional 2D knowledge graph embeddings. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 32, no. 1.

- For **FB15K-237**, the citation is:
  > Toutanova, K., & Chen, D. (2015). Observed versus latent features for knowledge base and text inference. In Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality.

- For **ATOMIC**, the citation is:
  > Sap, M., Le Bras, R., Allaway, E., Bhagavatula, C., Lourie, N., Rashkin, H., Roof, B., Smith, N. A., & Choi, Y. (2019). Atomic: An atlas of machine commonsense for if-then reasoning. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, vol. 33, no. 01.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the ZeroKBC benchmark.
