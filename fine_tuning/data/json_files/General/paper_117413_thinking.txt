To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlation between Alignment-Uniformity and Performance of Dense Contrastive Representations" by Jong Hak Moon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various datasets, which indicates that I should find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for pre-training. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **STL-10**: This dataset is described as a single-object dataset containing approximately 103,000 images from the training and unlabeled sets. It is commonly used for evaluating visual representation learning.

2. **MS COCO**: This dataset is a multi-object dataset with around 118,000 images from the training set. It is widely used for tasks such as object detection and segmentation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the **STL-10** and **MS COCO** datasets for their experiments, which reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215–223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

- For **MS COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755. Springer, 2014.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
