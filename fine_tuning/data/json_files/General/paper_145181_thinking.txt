To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unveiling Incomplete Modality Brain Tumor Segmentation: Leveraging Masked Predicted Auto-Encoder and Divergence Learning" by Zhongao Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **BRATS2018 and BRATS2020 datasets**, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the **BRATS2018 dataset** as comprising 285 cases with publicly available ground truth annotations, including multi-contrast MRI exams with four sequences: FLAIR, T1, T1c, and T2. The **BRATS2020 dataset** is mentioned as containing MRI scans of brain tumors with meticulous annotations, also including the same four modalities.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **BRATS2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Menze, B. H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., et al. (2015). "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(10), 1993-2024.

- For the **BRATS2020 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bakas, S., Akbari, H., et al. (2020). "Advancing the Cancer Genome Atlas glioma MRI collections with expert segmentation labels and radiomic features." *Scientific Data*, 7(1), 1-7.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
