To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Applying Large Language Models and Chain-of-Thought for Automatic Scoring" by Gyeong-Geon Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and findings sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "testing dataset comprising six assessment tasks with 1,650 student responses," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used in their study. Here, they describe that the dataset consists of student responses collected from middle school students in the U.S. regarding scientific models. They also mention that the dataset was originally detailed in a previous study by Zhai, He, and Krajcik (2022).

The authors specify that the dataset includes six assessment tasks, three with binomial scoring rubrics and three with trinomial scoring rubrics, totaling 1,650 student responses. They also discuss the scoring process and the inter-rater reliability of the scoring, which adds credibility to the dataset's quality.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will look at the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Zhai, X., He, P., & Krajcik, J. (2022). Applying machine learning to automatically assess scientific models. *Journal of Research in Science Teaching*, 59(10), 1765â€“1794. https://doi.org/10.1002/tea.21773

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Middle School Science Assessment Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset comprising 1,650 student responses to six assessment tasks designed to evaluate students' understanding of scientific models related to physical sciences.
   - **Source**: Zhai, He, and Krajcik (2022).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included for proper attribution. This process highlights the importance of thorough reading and cross-referencing to accurately extract and document datasets from research papers.
