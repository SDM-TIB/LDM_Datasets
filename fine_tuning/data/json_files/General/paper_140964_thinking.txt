To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reasoning-Enhanced Object-Centric Learning for Videos" by Jian Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention utilizing the **Multi-Object Video (MOVi) datasets**, which are categorized into five distinct categories: A, B, C, D, and E. The authors provide a brief description of each category, indicating the complexity and characteristics of the scenes depicted in the datasets.

1. **MOVi-A**: Contains straightforward scenes with a maximum of 10 objects.
2. **MOVi-B**: Similar to MOVi-A, also featuring simple scenes with up to 10 objects.
3. **MOVi-C**: More complex scenes with up to 10 objects, generated using a stationary camera.
4. **MOVi-D**: Even more complex, accommodating a maximum of 23 objects.
5. **MOVi-E**: Introduces random linear camera movements, adding complexity to the scenes.

The authors also mention that each video sequence is sampled at a rate of 12 frames per second, resulting in a total of 24 frames per second.

To ensure I have the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the MOVi datasets are likely proprietary or specific to the authors' research, and they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the datasets are referenced as follows:

- **Multi-Object Video (MOVi) datasets**: Research, G. (2020). Google scanned objects. Retrieved from https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/GoogleResearch/fuel/collections/Google%20Scanned%20Objects.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and citations in a structured format for clarity.

After completing this process, I will have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, along with their descriptions and citations, ready for further analysis or processing.
