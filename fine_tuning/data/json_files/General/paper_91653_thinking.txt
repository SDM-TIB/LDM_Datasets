To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delving into the Imbalance of Positive Proposals in Two-stage Object Detection" by Zheng Ge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions experiments on the **COCO** and **CrowdHuman** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the **COCO** dataset, stating that it is a widely used benchmark in the object detection field, consisting of 118,000 images for training and 5,000 for evaluation. This confirms that COCO is indeed a dataset used in their experiments.

In section 4.4, the authors discuss the **CrowdHuman** dataset, which contains 15,000 training images, 4,370 validation images, and 5,000 testing images. This dataset is specifically mentioned as a benchmark for detecting humans in crowded situations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision. pp. 740–755. Springer.

2. For the **CrowdHuman dataset**, the citation is:
   > Shao, S., Zhao, Z., Li, B., Xiao, T., Yu, G., Zhang, X., Sun, J. (2018). *Crowdhuman: A benchmark for detecting human in a crowd*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.00123.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **COCO Dataset**: A widely used benchmark in object detection, consisting of 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images.
- **CrowdHuman Dataset**: A benchmark for detecting humans in crowded situations, containing 15,000 training images, 4,370 validation images, and 5,000 testing images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
