To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SVFormer: Semi-supervised Video Transformer for Action Recognition" by Zhen Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three datasets: **Kinetics-400**, **UCF-101**, and **HMDB-51**. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of semi-supervised action recognition and mention the datasets again. They specifically state that extensive experiments were conducted on the three datasets, confirming their relevance to the study.

I will then check the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **Section 4.1**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they describe:

1. **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale human action video dataset with up to 245,000 training samples and 20,000 validation samples, covering 400 different categories.
2. **UCF-101**: A dataset consisting of 13,320 video samples across 101 categories.
3. **HMDB-51**: A smaller dataset with 6,766 videos across 51 categories.

The authors also mention the specific labeling rates used for experiments on these datasets, which adds context to their usage.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:
  > Joao Carreira and Andrew Zisserman. *Quo vadis, action recognition? A new model and the kinetics dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **HMDB-51**, the citation is:
  > Hildegard Kuehne, Hueihan Jhuang, Est√≠baliz Garrote, Tomaso Poggio, and Thomas Serre. *HMDB: A large video database for human motion recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
