To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Galileo at SemEval-2020 Task 12: Multi-lingual Learning for Offensive Language Identification using Pre-trained Language Models" by Shuohuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in SemEval-2020 Task 12, which suggests that datasets related to offensive language identification are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using datasets from **OffensEval 2019** and **OffensEval 2020**. I will extract the relevant details about these datasets, including their purpose and any statistics provided.

In **sub-section 4.1 (Sub-Task A - Offensive Language Identification)**, the authors provide statistics for the dataset used in Sub-task A, which includes data from multiple languages: English, Turkish, Arabic, Danish, and Greek. I will note the number of offensive and non-offensive posts for each language.

In **sub-section 4.2 (Sub-Task B - Automatic Offense Language Categorization)**, the authors describe the dataset used for categorizing offense types, which includes data from both OffensEval 2019 and OffensEval 2020. I will extract the relevant statistics for this dataset as well.

In **sub-section 4.3 (Sub-Task C - Offense Target Identification)**, the authors again provide statistics for the dataset used to identify the target of offenses. I will gather this information too.

After identifying the datasets and their details, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the OffensEval datasets are as follows:

- For **OffensEval 2019**, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Shervin Malmasi, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Noura Farra, and Ritesh Kumar. *Semeval-2019 task 6: Identifying and categorizing offensive language in social media (offenseval)*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 75–86, 2019.

- For **OffensEval 2020**, the citation is:
  > Marcos Zampieri, Preslav Nakov, Sara Rosenthal, Pepa Atanasova, Georgi Karadzhov, Hamdy Mubarak, Leon Derczynski, Zeses Pitenis, and C¸ a˘grı C¸ ¨oltekin. *SemEval-2020 Task 12: Multilingual Offensive Language Identification in Social Media (OffensEval 2020)*. In Proceedings of SemEval, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
