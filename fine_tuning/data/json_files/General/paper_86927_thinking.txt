To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer" by Colin Raffel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors released a new dataset called the **Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)**, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments and results sections**. In the methodology, the authors describe the C4 dataset and its characteristics, which is crucial for understanding its application in their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several other datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: A collection of diverse natural language understanding tasks.
2. **SuperGLUE Benchmark**: An advanced benchmark for evaluating language understanding.
3. **SQuAD**: A reading comprehension dataset.
4. **CNN/Daily Mail**: A dataset for summarization tasks.
5. **WMT Translation Datasets**: Including English to German, English to French, and English to Romanian translation tasks.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I found:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
