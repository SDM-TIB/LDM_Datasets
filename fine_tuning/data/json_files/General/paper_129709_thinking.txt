To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-class point cloud completion networks for 3D cardiac anatomy reconstruction from cine magnetic resonance images" by Marcel Beetz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of a method on a large synthetic dataset and real cine MRI acquisitions from the UK Biobank study, indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for method development and evaluation. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about each dataset.

In **subsection 2.1**, the authors describe the first dataset:
- **3D MRI-based statistical shape model**: This dataset is based on the biventricular shape model from Bai et al. (2015), created from 3D cardiac MRI scans of 1084 healthy volunteers. The resolution is specified as 1.25×1.25×2 mm. This dataset is used to derive a population of 3D biventricular anatomies for training and evaluation.

Then, in **subsection 2.2**, the authors detail the second dataset:
- **UK Biobank**: This dataset consists of 2D cine MRI acquisitions from 1000 subjects (500 male and 500 female) randomly selected from the UK Biobank study. The authors specify the imaging resolution as 1.8 × 1.8 × 8.0 mm and describe how they select the first temporal frame of the cine sequence as the end-diastolic phase.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For the **3D MRI-based statistical shape model**, the citation is:
> Bai, W., Shi, W., de Marvao, A., Dawes, T.J., O’Regan, D.P., Cook, S.A., Rueckert, D. (2015). A bi-ventricular cardiac atlas built from 1000+ high resolution MR images of healthy subjects and an analysis of shape and motion. *Medical Image Analysis*, 26, 133–145.

For the **UK Biobank**, the citation is:
> Petersen, S.E., Aung, N., Sanghvi, M.M., Zemrak, F., Fung, K., Miguel Paiva, J., Francis, J.M., Khanji, M.Y., Lukaschuk, E., Lee, A.M., et al. (2017). Reference ranges for cardiac structure and function using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in Caucasians from the UK Biobank population cohort. *Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance*, 19, 1–19.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
