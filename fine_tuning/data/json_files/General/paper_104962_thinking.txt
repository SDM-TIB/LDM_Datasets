To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Curriculum Learning for AMR Parsing" by Peiyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on AMR2.0 and AMR3.0, which indicates that these datasets are likely to be significant in their research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they evaluate their hierarchical curriculum learning framework on two popular AMR benchmarks: **AMR2.0** and **AMR3.0**. They provide details about the number of sentence-AMR pairs in each dataset, which confirms their relevance.

In the **datasets subsection** (B.1), the authors provide specific information about the datasets:
1. **AMR2.0 (LDC2017T10)**: This dataset contains 36,521 sentence-AMR pairs, with 1,368 for training, 1,371 for development, and 1,371 for testing.
2. **AMR3.0 (LDC2020T02)**: This dataset is larger, containing 55,635 sentence-AMR pairs, with 1,722 for development and 1,898 for testing.

Additionally, the authors mention out-of-domain datasets in subsection B.2:
1. **BIO**: A test set of the Bio-AMR corpus, consisting of 500 instances.
2. **TLP**: An AMR dataset annotated on the children's novel "The Little Prince," consisting of 1,562 instances.
3. **New3**: A subset of AMR3.0, consisting of 527 instances.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for AMR2.0 and AMR3.0 are as follows:
- For **AMR2.0**:
  > Laura Banarescu, Claire Bonial, Shu Cai, Madalina Georgescu, Kira Griffith, Ulf Hermjakob, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Martha Palmer, and Nathan Schneider. *Abstract Meaning Representation for sembanking*. In Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop and Interoperability with Discourse, pages 178–186, Sofia, Bulgaria. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2013.

- For **AMR3.0**:
  > Laura Banarescu, Claire Bonial, Shu Cai, Madalina Georgescu, Kira Griffith, Ulf Hermjakob, Kevin Knight, Philipp Koehn, Martha Palmer, and Nathan Schneider. *AMR 3.0: A New Release of the Abstract Meaning Representation Corpus*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations, pages 38–45, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

For the out-of-domain datasets, the paper does not provide specific citations, but I will note their names and the context in which they were mentioned.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.
