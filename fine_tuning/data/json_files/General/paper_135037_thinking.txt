To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-Center Study on the Adaptability of a Shared Foundation Model for Electronic Health Records," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include mentions of datasets. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, I find that the study utilized two main datasets:

1. **SickKids Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from the SickKids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR) and contains EHR data for 1.8 million patients collected from June 2018 to March 2023.

2. **MIMIC-IV Dataset**: This dataset encompasses data from 340,000 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or the emergency department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) between 2008 and 2019.

Next, I will confirm the details of these datasets by checking the **results section** to ensure they were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional context about their application.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **SickKids Dataset**, the citation is:
> Guo, L. L. et al. Development and validation of the SickKids Enterprise-wide Data in Azure Repository (SEDAR). *Heliyon*, 9, e21586, doi:10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e21586 (2023).

For the **MIMIC-IV Dataset**, the citation is:
> Johnson, A. et al. MIMIC-IV (version 1.0). doi:10.13026/s6n6-xd98 (2021).

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will facilitate further research and validation by others in the field.
