To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Surface Variations" by Dan Hendrycks and Thomas G. Dietterich, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets introduced or utilized in the research. The abstract mentions two datasets: **IMAGENET-C** and **ICONS-50**, which are crucial for evaluating robustness against corruptions and surface variations.

Next, I will delve into the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that explicitly discuss datasets. In section 3, titled **The IMAGENET-C Corruption Robustness Benchmark**, the authors describe the IMAGENET-C dataset in detail. They explain that it consists of 15 types of visual corruptions applied to the ImageNet validation images, which is essential for benchmarking corruption robustness. The dataset can be recreated or downloaded from a specified GitHub link.

Following that, I will examine section 4, which introduces the **ICONS-50 dataset**. This section provides a comprehensive description of the dataset, including its composition of 10,000 images across 50 classes of icons, and highlights its purpose in evaluating surface variation robustness. The authors also provide a link for downloading the dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. For **IMAGENET-C**:
   > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas G. Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Surface Variations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

2. For **ICONS-50**:
   > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas G. Dietterich. *Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Surface Variations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.12261, 2019.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the documentation process. This structured approach will help in effectively extracting and presenting the datasets from the research paper.
