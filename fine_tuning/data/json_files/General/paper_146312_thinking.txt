To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MLKD-BERT: Multi-level Knowledge Distillation for Pre-trained Language Models" by Ying Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **GLUE benchmark** and **extractive question answering tasks**, indicating that these are datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly list the datasets involved in their experiments:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This is a collection of nine different tasks designed to evaluate the performance of models on various natural language understanding tasks. The authors mention that GLUE includes tasks such as MNLI, QQP, and others.

2. **SQuAD 1.1**: This dataset consists of over 100,000 question-answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles, where the answers are spans of text from the articles.

3. **SQuAD 2.0**: This dataset builds on SQuAD 1.1 by adding over 50,000 unanswerable questions, making it a more challenging dataset for extractive question answering.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GLUE Benchmark**, the citation is:

- For **SQuAD 1.1**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
