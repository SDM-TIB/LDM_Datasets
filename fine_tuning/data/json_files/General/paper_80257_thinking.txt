To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Mini-Batch SDCA" by Martin Takáč et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly describe the datasets they used in a specific section, often titled "Datasets," "Data," or "Experiments." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a **Table 1** that lists the characteristics of several datasets. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **epsilon**: 
   - Number of training samples: 400,000
   - Number of test samples: Not specified
   - Number of features: 2,000
   - Sparsity: 100%

2. **rcv1**: 
   - Number of training samples: 20,242
   - Number of test samples: 677,399
   - Number of features: 47,236
   - Sparsity: 0.15%

3. **news20**: 
   - Number of training samples: 15,000
   - Number of test samples: 4,996
   - Number of features: 1,355,191
   - Sparsity: 0.03%

4. **real-sim**: 
   - Number of training samples: 72,309
   - Number of test samples: Not specified
   - Number of features: 20,958
   - Sparsity: 0.24%

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the **libsvm collection** as the source for these datasets. The citation is:

> Libsvm. Datasets. http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/∼cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. Each dataset will be documented with its name, training and test sample sizes, number of features, sparsity, and the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
