To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discriminative Hamiltonian Variational Autoencoder for Accurate Tumor Segmentation in Data-Scarce Regimes" by Aghiles Kebailia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two datasets:

1. **BRATS2021 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 1258 subjects with high-grade and low-grade glioma cases, including multiple MRI modalities. The authors specify that they only consider the whole tumor (WT) region for their experiments.

2. **HECKTOR2022 Dataset**: This dataset is focused on head and neck tumor segmentation and consists of 882 subjects with PET and CT images. The authors mention that they only use the PET modality for their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **BRATS2021 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ujjwal Baid, Satyam Ghodasara, Suyash Mohan, Michel Bilello, Evan Calabrese, Errol Colak, Keyvan Farahani, Jayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, Felipe C Kitamura, Sarthak Pati, et al. *The rsna-asnr-miccai brats 2021 benchmark on brain tumor segmentation and radiogenomic classification*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.02314, 2021.

- For the **HECKTOR2022 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vincent Andrearczyk, Valentin Oreiller, Sarah Boughdad, Catherine Cheze Le Rest, Hesham Elhalawani, Mario Jreige, John O Prior, Martin Vallières, Dimitris Visvikis, Mathieu Hatt, et al. *Overview of the hecktor challenge at miccai 2021: automatic head and neck tumor segmentation and outcome prediction in pet/ct images*. In 3D head and neck tumor segmentation in PET/CT challenge, pages 1–37. Springer, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
