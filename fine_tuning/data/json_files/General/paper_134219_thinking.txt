To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LoRAShear: Efficient Large Language Model Structured Pruning and Knowledge Recovery" by Tianyi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of large language models and mentions the use of "pretraining and instructed fine-tuning datasets," which suggests that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Numerical Experiments)**, particularly the **4.1 (Dataset Selection)** subsection, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for pretraining and fine-tuning. Here, they mention:

1. **OpenWebText**: This dataset is noted as an alternative to the English CommonCrawl and C4 datasets. It is important to find the full citation for this dataset.
   
2. **Wikipedia Dump (2022)**: The authors refer to a processed dump of Wikipedia from 2022. I will need to ensure I can cite this appropriately, possibly by referencing the Wikimedia Foundation.

3. **Gutenberg**: This dataset is mentioned as part of their collection. I will look for the appropriate citation for this dataset.

4. **BookCorpus**: The authors also include BookCorpus in their dataset collection. I will find the citation for this dataset as well.

In the same section, the authors discuss the **instructed fine-tuning dataset**:

1. **Alpaca**: This dataset is described as consisting of 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAIâ€™s text-davinci-003 engine. I will need to find the citation for this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I will look for are:

- For **OpenWebText**:
  > Aaron Gokaslan, Vanya Cohen, E. P. S. T. *Openwebtext corpus*. 2019.

- For **Wikipedia Dump (2022)**:
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikimedia downloads*. URL: https://dumps.wikimedia.org.

- For **Gutenberg**:
  > Gerlach, M. and Font-Clos, F. *A standardized project Gutenberg corpus for statistical analysis of natural language and quantitative linguistics*. Entropy, 22(1):126, 2020.

- For **BookCorpus**:
  > Zhu, Y., Kiros, R., Zemel, R., Salakhutdinov, R., Urtsun, R., Torralba, A., and Fidler, S. *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. In The IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For **Alpaca**:
  > Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Zhang, T., Dubois, Y., Li, X., Guestrin, C., Liang, P., and Hashimoto, T. B. *Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following llama model*. 2023. URL: https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
