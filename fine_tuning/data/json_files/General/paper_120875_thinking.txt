To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Goal-guided Transformer-enabled Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Autonomous Navigation" by Wenhui Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it mentions the use of a novel approach, it does not explicitly name any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any mentions of datasets used in prior work or in the current study. The introduction discusses various reinforcement learning algorithms and their applications but does not specify any datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the experimental setup. This section often contains information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this paper, the authors describe the use of a simulation environment (Gazebo) and a real-world environment for testing their approach, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or validation. The authors mention collecting data from human participants for deep imitation learning, which involves state-action pairs. They state that they collected 200 trajectories, comprising 17,215 state-action pairs, but they do not refer to this as a formal dataset with a specific name.

Since the paper does not provide formal dataset names or citations, I will note that the data collected from human demonstrations is a critical component of their methodology. However, it lacks a formal citation as it is not a publicly available dataset.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous work. The references primarily focus on algorithms and methodologies rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses the collection of data for training purposes, it does not provide formal dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will document the information as follows:

1. **Human Demonstration Data**: Collected from participants performing goal-driven navigation tasks, resulting in 17,215 state-action pairs. However, this is not a formally named dataset and lacks a citation.

Since there are no formal datasets with citations in this paper, I will summarize my findings accordingly.
