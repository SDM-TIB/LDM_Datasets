To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Multitask Neural Network for Face Alignment, Head Pose Estimation and Face Tracking" by Jiahao Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on four benchmark datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples or specific attributes.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **WFLW**: This dataset contains 10,000 faces, with 7,500 for training and 2,500 for testing, and includes 98 landmarks along with attributes such as pose, expression, illumination, make-up, occlusion, and blur.

2. **300W-LP**: This is a synthetic dataset that fits samples from the 300W dataset to 3D models, generating 122,450 samples with head pose labels.

3. **WIDER Face**: A face detection benchmark dataset that includes 32,203 images and 393,703 labeled faces, characterized by variability in scale, pose, and occlusion.

4. **300VW**: This dataset consists of video face alignment data, containing 50 videos for training and 64 for testing, divided into three subsets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **WFLW**, the citation is:
  > Wu, W., et al. (2018). *WFLW: A Benchmark for Face Landmark Localization in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pp. 1-16.

- For **300W-LP**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, S., et al. (2016). *Face Alignment Across Large Poses: A 3D Solution*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 146-155.

- For **WIDER Face**, the citation is:
  > Yang, S., et al. (2016). *WIDER FACE: A Face Detection Benchmark*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 5525-5533.

- For **300VW**, the citation is:
  > Shen, J., et al. (2015). *The First Facial Landmark Tracking in-the-Wild Challenge: Benchmark and Results*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 1003-1011.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
