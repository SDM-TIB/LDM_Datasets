To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UDepth: Fast Monocular Depth Estimation for Visually-guided Underwater Robots" by Boxiao Yu, Jiayi Wu, and Md Jahidul Islam, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions key datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of underwater depth estimation and the need for large-scale datasets. This section may provide insights into the datasets they utilized or referenced.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they state that they used the **USOD10K dataset** and the **Sea-Thru dataset**.

1. **USOD10K Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing RGB images and ground truth depth maps for various underwater scenes, with a total of 9229 training samples and 1026 testing samples.

2. **Sea-Thru Dataset**: This dataset is used for performance evaluation and is referenced as containing benchmark images for testing the UDepth model.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **USOD10K dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hong, L., Wang, X., Zhang, G., & Zhao, M. (2022). USOD10K: A New Benchmark Dataset for Underwater Salient Object Detection. Online: github.com/LinHong-HIT/USOD10K. Accessed: 09-09-2022.

- For the **Sea-Thru dataset**, the citation is:
  > Akkaynak, D., & Treibitz, T. (2019). Sea-thru: A method for removing water from underwater images. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1682â€“1691.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
