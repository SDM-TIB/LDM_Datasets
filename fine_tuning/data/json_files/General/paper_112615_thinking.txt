To extract datasets from the research paper titled "5th Place Solution for YouTube-VOS Challenge 2022: Video Object Segmentation" by Wangwang Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **YouTube-VOS dataset**, which is a strong lead for a dataset.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges in video object segmentation and mention two key datasets: **YouTube-VOS** and **DAVIS 2017**. They highlight that YouTube-VOS is a large-scale benchmark, which suggests it is a primary dataset for their experiments.

In the **method section**, the authors elaborate on their approach and mention additional datasets that supplement their work. They specifically reference **YouTubeVIS**, **OVIS**, and **VSPW** as datasets that enhance the diversity and complexity of the training data. This is crucial as it indicates that these datasets were also utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used. The authors explicitly state that they used **YouTube-VOS**, **DAVIS 2017**, **YouTubeVIS**, **OVIS**, and **VSPW** for training and evaluation. This confirms the datasets I need to document.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

1. **YouTube-VOS**:

4. **OVIS**:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
