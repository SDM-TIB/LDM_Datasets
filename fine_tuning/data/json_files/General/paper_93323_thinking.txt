To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem revisited" by Johannes Schmidt-Hieber, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or methodologies**. The abstract does not mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction. In the introduction, the focus is primarily on theoretical aspects of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and its implications for neural networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Deep ReLU networks and the KA representation)** and **section 4 (Related literature)**, as these sections may contain references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons. However, upon reviewing these sections, it appears that the paper is more theoretical and does not provide specific datasets used in empirical studies.

Since there are no datasets explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. However, the references primarily consist of theoretical papers and do not point to specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no datasets provided or referenced in this research. Therefore, I will not be able to create dataset entries or citations as there are none to extract.

In summary, my process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Examining sections discussing methodologies and experiments for dataset references.
3. Checking the references for any indirect mentions of datasets.
4. Concluding that no datasets are present in the paper.

Since no datasets were found, there will be no dataset entries or citations to compile.
