To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Make-Your-Video: Customized Video Generation Using Textual and Structural Guidance" by Jinbo Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a Latent Diffusion Model for video generation, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the training or evaluation of the model.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors mention the **WebVid-10M dataset**. This dataset is described as consisting of 10.7 million video-caption pairs with a total of 52K video hours, indicating its scale and diversity.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WebVid-10M dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, GÃ¼l Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in time: A joint video and image encoder for end-to-end retrieval*. In IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

Since the paper primarily discusses the WebVid-10M dataset, I will ensure to highlight its significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.

After completing this process, I will have a well-documented entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or reference.
