To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Revisiting Consistency for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Ivan Grubišić, Marin Oršić, and Siniša Šegvić, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses semi-supervised learning and mentions experiments with additional data from the **Cityscapes dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In this section, they mention using the **Cityscapes dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks. They specify that Cityscapes contains 2,975 training images, 500 validation images, and 1,525 testing images, which provides a clear description of the dataset's structure.

Additionally, I will check the **experimental setup** section for any other datasets that might be referenced. The authors also mention using **CIFAR-10** for image classification tasks, which consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Cityscapes Dataset**:

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
