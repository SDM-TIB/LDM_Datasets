To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Attention-based Siamese-Difference Neural Network with Surrogate Ranking Loss function for Perceptual Image Quality Assessment" by Seyed Mehdi Ayyoubzadeh and Ali Royat, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used public datasets for training their model, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several public datasets: **TID 2008**, **TID 2013**, **PieApp**, and **PIPAL**. This is a strong indication that these datasets are relevant to their work.

Next, I will check the **experimental results section** to confirm the use of these datasets. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used the **PIPAL dataset** for training their models, which contains 1.13 million images with human-judged scores. This confirms its relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **TID 2008**: The citation is:
   > Ponomarenko, N., Lukin, V., & Zelensky, A. (2004). TID2008 â€“ A database for evaluation of full-reference visual quality assessment metrics. 

2. **TID 2013**: The citation is:
   > Ponomarenko, N., Jin, L., Ieremeiev, O., Lukin, V., Egiazarian, K., Astola, J., Vozel, B., Chehdi, K., Carli, M., Battisti, F., & Kuo, C.-C. J. (2015). Image database TID2013: Peculiarities, results and perspectives. Signal Processing: Image Communication, 30, 57-77.

3. **PieApp**: The citation is:
   > Prashnani, E., Cai, H., Mostofi, Y., & Sen, P. (2018). PieApp: Perceptual image-error assessment through pairwise preference. 

4. **PIPAL**: The citation is:
   > Gu, J., Cai, H., Chen, H., Ye, X., Ren, J., & Dong, C. (2020). PIPAL: A large-scale image quality assessment dataset for perceptual image restoration. 

After gathering the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
