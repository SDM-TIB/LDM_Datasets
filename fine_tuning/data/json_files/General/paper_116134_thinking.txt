To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MTR-A: 1st Place Solution for 2022 Waymo Open Dataset Challenge - Motion Prediction" by Shaoshuai Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved first place in a challenge using the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their work.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors discuss their model's performance on the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**. They provide details about their approach and how it relates to the dataset, confirming its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. The relevant citation is:

> Scott Ettinger, Shuyang Cheng, Benjamin Caine, Chenxi Liu, Hang Zhao, Sabeek Pradhan, Yuning Chai, Ben Sapp, Charles R Qi, Yin Zhou, et al. *Large scale interactive motion forecasting for autonomous driving: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1-10, 2021.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Waymo Open Motion Dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be done in a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in this research paper, ready for further processing or review.
