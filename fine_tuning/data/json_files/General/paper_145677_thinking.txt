To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Network-community analysis of cellular senescence" by Alda Sabalic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves analyzing transcriptional profiles from RNA sequencing data obtained from injured muscle tissue in mice, which suggests that there is a dataset related to this analysis.

Next, I will examine the **experimental data** section, which provides detailed information about the data collection process. The authors describe that they analyzed RNA sequencing data from distinct cell types extracted from muscle tissue of healthy and injured mice. They mention that the data consists of 108 samples characterized by 46,078 genes, which is a significant dataset.

In the **results** section, the authors discuss the filtering and analysis of the gene expression data, but they do not introduce new datasets. Instead, they focus on the analysis of the existing dataset. Therefore, I will note that the primary dataset is the RNA sequencing data from the muscle tissue.

I will also check the **materials and methods** section for any additional datasets or specific details about the data collection process. The authors mention that the data was obtained from experiments on young and geriatric mice, which adds context to the dataset but does not introduce new datasets.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to previously published single-cell RNA sequencing data in a different type of tissue, which may be relevant for citation. The specific reference they mention is:

- Omori, S., Wang, T.W., Johmura, Y., Kanai, T., Nakano, Y., Kido, T., et al. *Generation of a p16 Reporter Mouse and Its Use to Characterize and Target p16high Cells In Vivo*. Cell Metabolism 2020;32(5):814–828.e6. doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.09.006.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **RNA Sequencing Data from Muscle Tissue**: This dataset includes 108 samples characterized by 46,078 genes, derived from young and geriatric mice subjected to muscle injury.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is based on the authors' own experiments.

2. **Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data**: This dataset is referenced for validation purposes and is related to the analysis of senescence markers.
   - Citation: Omori, S., Wang, T.W., Johmura, Y., Kanai, T., Nakano, Y., Kido, T., et al. *Generation of a p16 Reporter Mouse and Its Use to Characterize and Target p16high Cells In Vivo*. Cell Metabolism 2020;32(5):814–828.e6. doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2020.09.006.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to format the dataset entries according to the required structure for further processing.
