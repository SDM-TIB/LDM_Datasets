To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cyclical Variational Bayes Monte Carlo for Efficient Multi-Modal Posterior Distributions Evaluation" by Felipe Igea and Alice Cicirello, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method using numerical and experimental investigations, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **results section** where the authors describe the experiments conducted. They mention using various case studies, including numerical examples and an experimental investigation. I will look for specific datasets or data sources referenced in these examples.

In the **results section**, the authors detail four case studies:
1. **Himmelblau Multi-modal Posterior**: This case study references the Himmelblau function, which is a well-known mathematical function used to evaluate optimization algorithms. The authors mention that the posterior used has four distinct solutions, indicating that they likely used synthetic data generated from this function.

2. **Mass-spring System (Multi-modal Posterior)**: This example involves a 2-dimensional multi-modal Bayesian model updating system. The authors describe the parameters and their distributions, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation. However, they mention that the uniform priors for the spring constants are used, which suggests that the data is generated based on these parameters.

3. **Mass-spring System (Unimodal Posterior)**: Similar to the previous example, this case study involves a 2-DoF system with uncertain parameters. The authors describe the likelihood function and the experimental measurements used, but again, they do not provide a specific dataset citation.

4. **Experimental Validation: Aluminium Frame Problem**: This case study references experimental data obtained from an aluminium frame structure. The authors provide a table summarizing the experimental results, including natural frequencies for different configurations. They cite the source of the experimental data as [30] and [51], which I will need to reference for the dataset.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Himmelblau Multi-modal Posterior**: 
   - Dataset: Synthetic data generated from the Himmelblau function.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided, but the function is well-known in optimization literature.

2. **Mass-spring System (Multi-modal Posterior)**: 
   - Dataset: Generated based on the uniform priors for spring constants.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided.

3. **Mass-spring System (Unimodal Posterior)**: 
   - Dataset: Experimental measurements of natural frequencies.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided.

4. **Aluminium Frame Problem**: 
   - Dataset: Experimental data for natural frequencies from the aluminium frame structure.
   - Citation:

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset and its citation for future reference or processing.
