To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Structure-Guided Gauss-Newton Method for Shallow ReLU Neural Network" by Zhiqiang Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and experiments sections**. These sections typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, I will specifically look for sections that might be labeled as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Numerical Results."** These sections are likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets used in the study.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the text, such as the number of samples, features, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted by the authors.

After gathering the necessary information, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is essential for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the **UCI Abalone dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which might be formatted as follows:
> W. Nash, T. Sellers, S. Talbot, A. Cawthorn, and W. Ford. *Abalone*. UCI Machine Learning Repository, 1995. DOI: https://doi.org/10.24432/C55C7W.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and can be used for further analysis or replication of the study.
