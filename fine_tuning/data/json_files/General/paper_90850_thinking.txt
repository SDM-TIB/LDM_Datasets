To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single Pair Joint Cross-Modality Super Resolution" by Guy Shacht et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of cross-modality super-resolution methods, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, particularly those related to different imaging modalities.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** or **results** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their method's performance on various datasets, which is a strong indicator that they are using specific datasets for evaluation.

In the **results section**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ULB17-VT Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating visual-thermal pairs. The authors state that their method outperforms competing methods on this dataset.

2. **Shuffled-Middlebury Dataset**: This dataset is derived from the Middlebury dataset, where pairs are shuffled to create weakly aligned pairs. The authors mention that their method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on this dataset.

3. **EPFL NIR Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the method on near-infrared images. The authors report that their method achieves better results compared to competing methods on this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **ULB17-VT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Almasri, Feras, and Debeir, “ULB17-VT,” 2 2019.

- For the **Shuffled-Middlebury Dataset**, since it is derived from the Middlebury dataset, I will cite the original Middlebury dataset:
  > Scharstein, Daniel, and R. Szeliski, “A taxonomy and evaluation of dense two-frame stereo correspondence algorithms,” Int. J. Comput. Vision, vol. 47, pp. 7–42, Apr. 2002.

- For the **EPFL NIR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pierre-francois Laquerre, Nicolas Etienne, and C. Duplain, “RGB-NIR data,” 2011. Available: https://ivrlwww.epfl.ch/supplementary_material/cvpr11/index.html.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
