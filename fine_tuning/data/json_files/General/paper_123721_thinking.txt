To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Finding the Needle in a Haystack: Unsupervised Rationale Extraction from Long Text Classifiers" by Kamil Bujel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate performance on sentiment classification datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Grammatical Error Detection (GED) Datasets**: This includes essays from the Write & Improve platform and the BEA 2019 shared task. The authors note that these datasets contain human annotations for grammatical errors, which serve as rationales for document-level proficiency scores.

2. **The First Certificate in English (FCE) Dataset**: This dataset consists of essays written by non-native English learners for a language proficiency exam. The authors explain how they split the dataset based on scores to categorize learners.

3. **IMDB Dataset**: Specifically, the authors refer to a subset of the IMDB dataset that has been annotated with rationales for movie reviews, distinguishing between positive and negative reviews.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their models on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **BEA 2019 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Bryant, Mariano Felice, Øistein E. Andersen, and Ted Briscoe. *The BEA-2019 shared task on grammatical error correction*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications, pages 52–75, Florence, Italy, 2019. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **FCE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Helen Yannakoudakis, Ted Briscoe, and Ben Medlock. *A new dataset and method for automatically grading ESOL texts*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 180–189, 2011.

- For the **IMDB dataset**, the citation is:
  > Omar Zaidan, Jason Eisner, and Christine Piatko. *Using “annotator rationales” to improve machine learning for text categorization*. In Human Language Technologies 2007: The Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics; Proceedings of the Main Conference, pages 260–267, 2007.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
