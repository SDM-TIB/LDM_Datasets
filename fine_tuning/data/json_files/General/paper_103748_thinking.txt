To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DDS: A new device-degraded speech dataset for speech enhancement" by Haoyu Li and Junichi Yamagishi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract introduces the DDS dataset, which is designed to facilitate research on speech enhancement. It mentions that DDS provides aligned recordings of high-quality speech and various low-quality versions, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Dataset Overview)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the DDS dataset. Here, they describe how DDS is built on top of two existing datasets: **DAPS** and **VCTK**. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the DDS dataset, including its size (1,944 hours of recordings) and the various recording conditions.

In this section, I will note the following details about the datasets:

1. **DDS Dataset**: This is the main dataset introduced in the paper. It consists of realistic device-degraded speech recordings collected under various conditions. The authors provide a link to access the dataset: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.54641042.

2. **DAPS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a source of clean speech recordings used in the DDS dataset. The authors mention that it contains 50 hours of speech data collected on different devices in realistic environments.

3. **VCTK Dataset**: Another dataset used for clean speech recordings in the DDS dataset, which consists of eight hours of speech data from multiple speakers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for the DAPS and VCTK datasets, as well as the DDS dataset itself:

- For the **DDS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Haoyu Li and Junichi Yamagishi. "DDS: A new device-degraded speech dataset for speech enhancement." Available at: https://zenodo.org/record/5464104.

- For the **DAPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. J. Mysore. "Can we automatically transform speech recorded on common consumer devices in real-world environments into professional production quality speech?—a dataset, insights, and challenges." IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 22, no. 8, pp. 1006–1010, 2014.

- For the **VCTK dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Yamagishi, C. Veaux, and K. MacDonald. "CSTR VCTK Corpus: English multi-speaker corpus for CSTR Voice Cloning Toolkit (version 0.92)," 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets referenced in the paper.
