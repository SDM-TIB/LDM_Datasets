To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formal Language Recognition by Hard Attention Transformers" by Yiding Hao, Dana Angluin, and Robert Frank, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Hard Attention Transformers)** or any dedicated **datasets section**. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments, including their characteristics and how they relate to the research objectives.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the original sources.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might read something like:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring that I capture all relevant details and citations.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that all necessary information is organized and accessible for future reference.
