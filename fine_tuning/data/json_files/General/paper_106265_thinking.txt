To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLA2P: Self-supervised Anomaly Detection with Adversarial Perturbation" by Yizhou Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their method on, which include:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **Caltech 101**: A dataset with 9,146 images across 101 categories.
4. **20 Newsgroups**: A text dataset with approximately 20,000 documents partitioned across 20 newsgroups.
5. **Reuters-21578**: A collection of documents for text classification, containing 90 categories.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Caltech 101**:
  > Li Fei-Fei, Rob Fergus, and Pietro Perona. *Learning Generative Visual Models from Few Training Examples: An Incremental Bayesian Approach Tested on 101 Object Categories*. In CVPR, 2004.

- For **20 Newsgroups**:
  > Ken Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to Filter Netnews*. In Machine Learning Proceedings, 1995.

- For **Reuters-21578**:
  > David Lewis. *Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Test Collection*. 1997.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
