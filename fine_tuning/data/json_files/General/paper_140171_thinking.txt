To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ERBench: An Entity-Relationship Based Automatically Verifiable Hallucination Benchmark for Large Language Models" by Jio Oh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed an LLM benchmark using databases from multiple domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention five public databases:

1. **Movie Dataset**: This dataset includes attributes such as movie title, released year, director, country of origin, genre, and main stars. It is used for evaluating LLMs on questions related to movies.

2. **Soccer Dataset**: This dataset contains attributes like player name, club, jersey number, nationality, and league. It is utilized for evaluating LLMs on soccer-related questions.

3. **Airport Dataset**: This dataset includes attributes such as airport name, ICAO shortcode, latitude, longitude, and country code. It is used for questions related to airports.

4. **Music Dataset**: This dataset consists of attributes like music title, artist name, released year, and genre. It is used for evaluating LLMs on music-related questions.

5. **Book Dataset**: This dataset includes attributes such as book title, author, published date, and publisher name. It is used for questions related to books.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper provides links to the datasets, which I will use to construct the citations:

- **Movie Dataset**: 
  > Himanshu Sekhar Paul. *IMDb Movie Ratings Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/imdb-movie-ratings-dataset, 2018.

- **Soccer Dataset**: 
  > Stefano Leone. *FIFA 20 Complete Player Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset, 2019.

- **Airport Dataset**: 
  > Mike Borsetti. *Flights and Airports Data*. Available at: https://github.com/mwgg/Airports, 2020.

- **Music Dataset**: 
  > Luan Moura. *Music Dataset: 1950 to 2019*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/music-dataset-1950-to-2019, 2021.

- **Book Dataset**: 
  > Elvin Rustamov. *Books Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvinrustam/books-dataset, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
