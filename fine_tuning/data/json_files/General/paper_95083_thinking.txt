To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERTnesia: Investigating the capture and forgetting of knowledge in BERT" by Jonas Wallat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors utilize knowledge base completion tasks to probe BERT, which suggests that there are datasets involved in these tasks. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup section** (Section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, I will look for any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Data Sources." 

In Section 3.2, the authors describe the knowledge probes used in their experiments, which include:
1. **ConceptNet**: This dataset is used to test general conceptual knowledge.
2. **T-REx**: A dataset consisting of sentences for various relationship types.
3. **Google-RE**: A dataset for factual knowledge related to people.
4. **SQuAD**: A dataset for question answering, which has been rewritten into cloze-style statements.

I will also check the **Appendix** section for any additional details or datasets that may not have been mentioned in the main body of the paper. The Appendix provides links to download the datasets and additional context about their usage.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I need to extract are:
- For **ConceptNet**:
  > Speer, R., & Havasi, C. (2012). Representing general relational knowledge in ConceptNet 5. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2012, Istanbul, Turkey, May 23-25, 2012, pages 3679–3686. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **T-REx**:

In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2018, Miyazaki, Japan, May 7-12, 2018. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **Google-RE**:
  > Orr, D. (2013). 50,000 lessons on how to read: a relation extraction corpus. Online: Google Research Blog.

- For **SQuAD**:

The Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
