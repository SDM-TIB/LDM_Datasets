To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning battery model parameter dynamics from data with recursive Gaussian process regression" by Antti Aitio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of both simulated and measured data for battery health estimation, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention using "simulated and measured data," which indicates that there are at least two datasets to consider. I will need to find more details about these datasets in the subsequent sections.

In the **results** section, the authors describe their experiments and mention using "high energy 18650 Li-ion cells" and "measured current, voltage and temperature." This suggests that there is a dataset related to these measurements. I will also look for any references to publicly available datasets or specific datasets used in their experiments.

I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper refers to a dataset of time series data from a drive cycle aging test of lithium-ion cells, which is crucial for my extraction.

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors mention using simulated data generated from a model. However, they do not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is generated by their own modeling approach.

2. **Measured Data**: The authors refer to a dataset that includes current, voltage, and temperature measurements from high energy 18650 Li-ion cells. The citation for this dataset is:
   > D. Jöst, F. Ringbeck, A. Blömeke, and D. U. Sauer. *Timeseries data of a drive cycle aging test of 28 high energy NCA/C+Si round cells of type 18650*. 2021. DOI: 10.18154/RWTH-2021-02814.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
