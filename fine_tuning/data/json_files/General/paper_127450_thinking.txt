To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Look Ma, No Hands! Agent-Environment Factorization of Egocentric Videos" by Matthew Chang, Aditya Prakash, and Saurabh Gupta, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a method for analyzing egocentric videos, which suggests that datasets related to egocentric videos may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the potential of egocentric video datasets for robotic policy learning. They reference specific datasets, which I will need to locate in the text.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in the **Training Dataset** subsection, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their model. They state that the data is extracted from:

1. **Epic-Kitchens**: This dataset is used for training the model and is referenced multiple times throughout the paper. It is a large-scale dataset of egocentric videos.

2. **Ego4D**: A subset of this dataset is also mentioned, specifically focusing on kitchen videos. This dataset is used to generate synthetic training data by masking out hand-shaped regions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Epic-Kitchens**, the citation is:
  > Dima Damen, Hazel Doughty, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari, Jian Ma, Evangelos Kazakos, Davide Moltisanti, Jonathan Munro, Toby Perrett, Will Price, and Michael Wray. *Rescaling egocentric vision: Collection, pipeline and challenges for epic-kitchens-100*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 130:33â€“55, 2022.

- For **Ego4D**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
