To extract datasets from the research paper titled "How GNNs Facilitate CNNs in Mining Geometric Information from Large-Scale Medical Images" by Yiqing Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their fusion framework on histology datasets curated from large patient cohorts, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CRC-MSI**: This dataset is used for predicting microsatellite instability (MSI) status in colorectal cancer patients. It consists of H&E stained histology slides from 315 patients, with specific details about the training and test splits provided.

2. **STAD-MSI**: Similar to CRC-MSI, this dataset is focused on gastric adenocarcinoma patients and also targets MSI status prediction. It includes H&E stained slides from 360 patients.

3. **GIST-PDL1**: This privately curated dataset is used for predicting PD-L1 status from gastric cancer histology slides. It contains 129 well-annotated H&E stained slides from gastric cancer patients.

In the **data availability section**, the authors provide a link for the public datasets (CRC-MSI and STAD-MSI) and mention that the private dataset (GIST-PDL1) will be released after acceptance. I will ensure to note the URLs and any relevant details for citation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the references section:

- For **CRC-MSI**, the citation is:
  > Kather, J. N., Pearson, A. T., Halama, N., et al. (2019). Deep learning can predict microsatellite instability directly from histology in gastrointestinal cancer. *Nature Medicine*, 25(7), 1054-1056. DOI: 10.1038/s41591-019-0458-5.

- For **STAD-MSI**, the citation is the same as CRC-MSI since it is part of the same study:
  > Kather, J. N., Pearson, A. T., Halama, N., et al. (2019). Deep learning can predict microsatellite instability directly from histology in gastrointestinal cancer. *Nature Medicine*, 25(7), 1054-1056. DOI: 10.1038/s41591-019-0458-5.

- For **GIST-PDL1**, since it is a private dataset, there may not be a formal citation yet, but I will note that it is based on data collected from a specific hospital with ethical approval.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
