To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rock Classification Based On Residual Networks" by Sining Zhou, Yuyang Wang, and Zhihuan Jiang, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of convolutional neural networks for rock classification but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenge of insufficient data for training effective neural networks, indicating that they are likely using a specific dataset for their experiments. However, they do not provide a name or details about the dataset in this section.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss their methodology and results. In **section 4.1**, they mention the performance of the ResNet-34 model on their training dataset but do not specify the dataset's name. However, they do indicate that each rock type has only a handful of training samples, suggesting a specific dataset is being used.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **References section** for any cited datasets or related works that may provide context or lead to the identification of the dataset used. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite two papers related to their methodology but do not provide a specific dataset citation. This indicates that the dataset may be proprietary or not widely published.

Given that the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Not explicitly mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: The dataset consists of images of 53 rock varieties, each with 40 or fewer images for training. The authors employed data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset artificially.
3. **Citation**: No formal citation is provided for the dataset in the paper.

Since the dataset is not named or cited, I will note that the authors suggest the need for acquiring new data and expanding datasets for future work, which implies that they recognize the limitations of their current dataset.

In conclusion, I will document the findings regarding the dataset as follows:

- The paper does not specify a dataset name or provide a citation.
- The dataset consists of images of various rock types, with a limited number of samples per type.
- The authors emphasize the importance of data augmentation due to the small size of the dataset.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any relevant dataset information, even if it is not explicitly provided.
