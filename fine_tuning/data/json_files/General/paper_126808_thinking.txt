To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuperDriverAI: Towards Design and Implementation for End-to-End Learning-based Autonomous Driving" by Shunsuke Aoki et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected data from real-world driving scenarios, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section IV (SuperDriver AI)**, where the authors discuss the data collection process. They mention that they collected **150 runs for one driving scenario in Tokyo, Japan**. This is a specific dataset, but I need to gather more details about it.

In **section V (Real-World Deployment and Demonstration)**, the authors elaborate on their data collection methods, stating that they developed a cloud-based data platform to upload driving data from experienced human drivers. However, they do not specify the name of the dataset or provide a detailed description.

To ensure I have all necessary information, I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to datasets. However, it appears that the paper primarily discusses the data collection process without referencing established datasets.

Since the authors do not provide a formal dataset name or citation, I will summarize the dataset based on the information available:

1. **Driving Data from Human Drivers**: This dataset consists of 150 runs collected in Tokyo, Japan, involving various driving scenarios, including straight and turning maneuvers. The data includes inputs from an on-board vision camera, GPS, steering wheel, throttle, and brake system.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the details of the dataset as described in the paper. Since there are no formal citations for this dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it captures all relevant details while acknowledging the lack of a formal citation.
