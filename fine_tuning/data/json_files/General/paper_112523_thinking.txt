To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ratatouille: A tool for Novel Recipe Generation" by Mansi Goel et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the use of a large amount of recipe data for training deep learning models, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **RecipeDB dataset**. I will note the key details provided about this dataset, including its structure, the number of recipes, and the types of information it contains (e.g., ingredients, nutrition profiles, flavor profiles).

The authors describe RecipeDB as a structured compilation of 118,171 recipes from various cuisines, which includes detailed information about ingredients and cooking processes. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary context and specifics about the dataset.

After gathering the information from the dataset section, I will then refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the RecipeDB dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> D. Batra, N. Diwan, U. Upadhyay, J. S. Kalra, T. Sharma, A. K. Sharma, D. Khanna, J. S. Marwah, S. Kalathil, N. Singh et al., “RecipeDB: A resource for exploring recipes,” *Database*, vol. 2020, 2020.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information extracted, ensuring that it is clear and concise for any further processing or review.
