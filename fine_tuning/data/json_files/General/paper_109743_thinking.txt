To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Temporal Transductive Inference for Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation" by Mennatullah Siam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new benchmark dataset called **MiniVSPW**, which is a strong indicator that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the limitations of existing datasets, particularly the **YouTube-VIS** dataset, and introduce **MiniVSPW** as a solution to these limitations. This indicates that both datasets are relevant for extraction.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a comparison of their proposed method against existing benchmarks, specifically mentioning **YouTube-VIS** and **MiniVSPW**. They also provide statistics about the datasets, such as the number of annotated images and videos, which will be useful for a detailed description.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources for further exploration.

1. **MiniVSPW**: The authors describe this dataset as an improved benchmark that is exhaustively labeled, constructed from the **VSPW** dataset. The citation for VSPW is:
   > Miao, J., Wei, Y., Wu, Y., Liang, C., Li, G., Yang, Y. (2021). VSPW: A large-scale dataset for video scene parsing in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4133–4143. DOI: 10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00412

2. **YouTube-VIS**: This dataset is referenced as a standard benchmark for few-shot video object segmentation. The citation for YouTube-VIS is:
   > Chen, H., Wu, H., Zhao, N., Ren, S., He, S. (2021). Delving deep into many-to-many attention for few-shot video object segmentation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 14,040–14,049.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and provide proper attribution for each one.
