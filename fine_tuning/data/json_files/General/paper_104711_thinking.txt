To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Token Attacks on Vision Transformers" by Ameya Joshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the investigation of vision transformers and adversarial attacks but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention using a subset of **300 randomly chosen images from the ImageNet validation dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. Berg, and F. Li. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the findings into a structured format. 

In summary, the only dataset extracted from this paper is the ImageNet validation dataset, and I will ensure to include the full citation for it in the final output.
