To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Continual Learning Scenarios and Strategies for Audio Analysis" by Ruchi Bhatt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to gather initial information about the datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a comprehensive continual learning dataset for audio-based monitoring tasks, which indicates that datasets are a key focus of the research.

Next, I will specifically look at **section IV (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets, including their sources, characteristics, and how they are utilized in the context of continual learning scenarios.

In section IV, the authors describe two main datasets curated from the DCASE challenge tasks:

1. **DCASE2021 Task-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for domain-incremental scenarios and includes audio clips from various machine sounds categorized as normal and abnormal. The dataset consists of development segments from the DCASE2021 challenge, which has a total of 4,218 samples (2,109 normal and 2,109 abnormal).

2. **DCASE2020 Task-2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for class-incremental scenarios and focuses on machine-type classification. It includes normal sound samples from different machine types, with a total of 4,320 samples across various classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the DCASE datasets. The DCASE challenge datasets are publicly available, and their citations are typically provided in the challenge documentation or website.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **DCASE2021 Task-2**, the citation is:
  > DCASE Challenge. *DCASE 2021 Challenge on Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection for Machine Condition Monitoring*. Available: https://dcase.community/challenge2021/task2.

- For **DCASE2020 Task-2**, the citation is:
  > DCASE Challenge. *DCASE 2020 Challenge on Unsupervised Detection of Anomalous Sounds for Machine Condition Monitoring*. Available: https://dcase.community/challenge2020/task2.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
