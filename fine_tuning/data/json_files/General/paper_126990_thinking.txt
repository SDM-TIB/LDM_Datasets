To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VideoLLM: Modeling Video Sequence with Large Language Models" by Guo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their framework on multiple tasks sourced from four different datasets. This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look at **section 3 (Preliminary)**, where the authors provide a table (Table 2) that lists the tasks and corresponding datasets used in their experiments. This table is crucial as it summarizes the datasets associated with each task.

From Table 2, I can identify the following datasets:

1. **EK100**: Used for Online Action Detection and Action Segmentation.
2. **Breakfast**: Used for Online Captioning.
3. **Ego4D-Narration**: Used for Online Captioning.
4. **Ego4D-LTA**: Used for Action Anticipation and Long-term Anticipation.
5. **Ego4D-MQ**: Used for Moment Query.
6. **Ego4D-NLQ**: Used for Nature Language Query.
7. **QVHighlights**: Used for Highlight Detection.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details for each dataset used in the research paper.
