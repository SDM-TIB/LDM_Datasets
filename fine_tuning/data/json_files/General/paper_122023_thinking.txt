To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Run-Off Election: Improved Provable Defense against Data Poisoning Attacks" by Keivan Rezaei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating methods on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their methods on the **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **GTSRB** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*, 2009.

3. **GTSRB Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Stallkamp, J., Schlipsing, M., Salmen, J., & Igel, C. (2012). Man vs. computer: Benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition. *Neural Networks*, 32, 323-332.

After collecting the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I format the information clearly, including the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
