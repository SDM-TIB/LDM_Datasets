To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Corpus Poisoning via Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent" by Jinyan Su et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on several datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset contains 132,803 question-answer pairs collected from Wikipedia. It is crucial to note the size and source of the dataset.

2. **MS MARCO**: This dataset consists of 532,761 question-answer pairs collected from web documents. Again, I will note the size and source.

Additionally, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on several out-of-domain datasets, including **NFCorpus**, **Quora**, **SCIDOCS**, **SciFact**, and **FiQA-2018**. I will need to gather information about these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., et al. *Natural questions: a benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7:453–466, 2019.

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, T., Rosenberg, M., Song, X., Gao, J., Tiwary, S., Majumder, R., and Deng, L. *MS MARCO: A human-generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. 2016.

- For **NFCorpus**, the citation is:

- For **Quora**, the citation is:

- For **SCIDOCS**, the citation is:
  > Cohan, A., Feldman, S., Beltagy, I., Downey, D., and Weld, D. S. *Specter: Document-level representation learning using citation-informed transformers*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 2270–2282, 2020.

- For **SciFact**, the citation is:
  > Wadden, D., Lin, S., Lo, K., Wang, L. L., van Zuylen, M., Cohan, A., and Hajishirzi, H. *Fact or fiction: Verifying scientific claims*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 7534–7550, 2020.

- For **FiQA-2018**, the citation is:
  > Maia, M., Handschuh, S., Freitas, A., Davis, B., McDermott, R., Zarrouk, M., and Balahur, A. *In Companion WWW’18 open challenge: financial opinion mining and question answering*. Proceedings of the Web Conference 2018, pp. 1941–1942, 2018.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
