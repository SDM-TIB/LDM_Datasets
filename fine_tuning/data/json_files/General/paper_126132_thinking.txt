To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn How to Prune Pixels for Multi-View Neural Image-Based Synthesis" by Marta Milovanović et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for testing or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **background and proposed method sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used in their experiments or for training their models. In particular, I will look for any references to specific datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their work on pixel pruning and neural image-based rendering.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss their experimental conditions and results. They mention that their dataset consists of "eight perspective sequences from MIV CTC," which indicates that they are using a specific dataset related to the MPEG Immersive Video standard. I will note this dataset and any relevant details provided.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the MIV CTC, which is likely documented in the references. I will look for the specific citation that corresponds to the MIV standard or any related documents that describe the dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. The key dataset I have identified is:

1. **MIV CTC Dataset**: This dataset consists of eight perspective sequences with natural and computer-generated multi-view content captured by a sparse camera setup. The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the text, but I will refer to the relevant reference that discusses the MIV standard.

The citation for the MIV standard is:
> J. Jung and B. Kroon, “Common Test Conditions for MPEG Immersive Video,” ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 04 0051, Oct. 2020.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset and its citation, ready for any further processing or review.
