To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAGAR, Your Falsehood RADAR: RAG-Augmented Reasoning for Political Fact-Checking using Multimodal Large Language Models" by Mohammed Abdul Khaliq et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the integration of multimodal LLMs for fact-checking, which suggests that datasets may be involved, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed methodologies.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **MOCHEG dataset**, which is described as providing a set of 21,184 multimodal claims sourced from two fact-checking websites, PolitiFact and Snopes. The dataset is further pruned to include only claims that were fact-checked by PolitiFact, resulting in a test set of 794 claims, from which 300 are randomly selected for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MOCHEG dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Yao, B. M., Shah, A., Sun, L., Cho, J., & Huang, L. (2023). End-to-end multimodal fact-checking and explanation generation: A challenging dataset and models. In Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR ’23), pages 2733–2743. Association for Computing Machinery.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MOCHEG Dataset**: A dataset containing 21,184 multimodal claims sourced from PolitiFact and Snopes, with a test set of 794 claims after pruning.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
