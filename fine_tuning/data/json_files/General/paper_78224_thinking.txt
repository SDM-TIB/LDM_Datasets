To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Causally Regularized Learning with Agnostic Data Selection Bias" by Zheyan Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their proposed method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors explain how they generated this dataset using independent Gaussian distributions for causal and noisy variables. They also describe how the outcome variable is derived from the causal variables.

2. **YFCC100M**: This is a large-scale dataset containing 100 million images with multiple tags. The authors constructed a subset for their experiments, which includes 10 categories divided into 5 contexts.

3. **WeChat Ads**: This dataset was collected from the Tencent WeChat App and contains user feedback on advertisements, with demographic features included.

4. **Office-Caltech Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from four distinct domains (Amazon, DSLR, Webcam, and Caltech) and is commonly used in domain adaptation research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **YFCC100M**, the citation is:
  > Bart Thomee, David A Shamma, Gerald Friedland, Benjamin Elizalde, Karl Ni, Douglas Poland, Damian Borth, and Li-Jia Li. *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Commun. ACM 59, 2 (2016), 64–73.

- For the **Office-Caltech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Antonio Torralba and Alexei A Efros. *Unbiased look at dataset bias*. In Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 1521–1528.

The synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation since it is generated by the authors, but I will note its description for completeness.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described clearly along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
