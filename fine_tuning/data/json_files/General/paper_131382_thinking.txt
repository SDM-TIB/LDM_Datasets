To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using Deep Learning for an automatic detection and classification of the vascular bifurcations along the Circle of Willis" by Rafic Nadera et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that were utilized in the study. The authors may discuss previous works or datasets that are relevant to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection on data acquisition. Here, the authors describe the dataset they gathered, which consists of MRA images from 148 patients sourced from the ICAN database. They mention that these images were acquired from various medical institutions and MR machines, ensuring diversity in the dataset.

The authors also provide a detailed breakdown of the dataset in **Table 1**, which lists the different sets of images, the constructors (MRI manufacturers), and the number of participants for each set. This table is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional information about the dataset's performance or characteristics, which may provide insights into how the dataset was used in the experiments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset referenced is the **ICAN database**, which is a heterogeneous MRA dataset consisting of images from multiple institutions. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the ICAN database in the text, so I will note that it is a collection of MRA-TOF images from various sources.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Nader, R., Bourcier, R., Autrusseau, F. (2023). Using Deep Learning for an automatic detection and classification of the vascular bifurcations along the Circle of Willis. *Medical Image Analysis*. 

Since the authors do not provide a formal citation for the ICAN database, I will acknowledge it as a dataset used in the study without a specific reference.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the relevant details and citations as needed.
