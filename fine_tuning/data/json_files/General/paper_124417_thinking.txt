To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perceptual Quality Assessment of NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods for Front-Facing Views" by Hanxue Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **two datasets of scenes** captured in different environments, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they mention:

1. **Lab Dataset**: This dataset was captured in a controlled laboratory environment using a 2D gantry. It includes several sparse training views and a reference test video for evaluating neural view synthesis methods. The dataset consists of six scenes featuring various materials and complex geometries.

2. **Fieldwork Dataset**: This dataset was captured in real-world settings, both indoors and outdoors, using a gimbal or camera slider. It contains nine scenes with reference video sequences, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of the neural view synthesis methods.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that both the Lab and Fieldwork datasets were used for their subjective quality assessment experiments, reinforcing their importance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since the datasets are newly collected by the authors, they may not have formal citations yet. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper:

- **Lab Dataset**: The dataset is described in detail in the paper, but it does not have a formal citation since it is a new dataset created by the authors.

- **Fieldwork Dataset**: Similar to the Lab dataset, this dataset is also newly created and described in the paper without a formal citation.

Since both datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will document them as follows:

1. **Lab Dataset**: 
   - Description: Captured in a controlled laboratory environment with various materials and complex geometries. Contains six scenes with reference videos.
   - Citation: Liang, H., Wu, T., Hanji, P., Banterle, F., Gao, H., Mantiuk, R., & Oztireli, C. (2023). Perceptual Quality Assessment of NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods for Front-Facing Views.

2. **Fieldwork Dataset**: 
   - Description: Captured in real-world settings with nine scenes and reference video sequences. Allows for evaluation of neural view synthesis methods.
   - Citation: Liang, H., Wu, T., Hanji, P., Banterle, F., Gao, H., Mantiuk, R., & Oztireli, C. (2023). Perceptual Quality Assessment of NeRF and Neural View Synthesis Methods for Front-Facing Views.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the descriptions and citations as outlined above. This will provide a clear and structured summary of the datasets used in the research paper.
