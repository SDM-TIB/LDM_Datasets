To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cell lineage statistics with incomplete population trees" by Arthur Genthon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a theoretical framework for analyzing cell lineage statistics and mentions testing the method using an experimental dataset involving mycobacteria exposed to antibiotics. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to look for.

Next, I will examine the **methods and experiments sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the methods section, the authors describe their approach and mention using experimental data of mycobacteria subjected to antibiotics. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its name, size, and any relevant characteristics.

In the **results section**, I will look for any additional datasets that may be referenced or analyzed. The authors may provide insights into how the datasets were used to validate their theoretical framework.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations. The paper mentions using data from a study on mycobacteria exposed to isoniazid (INH). I will locate the original source of this dataset to provide a complete citation.

For example, if the dataset is from the following paper:
- Wakamoto, Y., Dhar, N., Chait, R., Schneider, K., Signorino-Gelo, F., Leibler, S., & McKinney, J. D. (2013). *Science*, 339(6119), 91-95.

I will ensure to format the citation correctly according to the style used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
