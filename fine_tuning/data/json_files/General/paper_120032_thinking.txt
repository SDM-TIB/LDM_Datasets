To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Feedback Optimization of Compressor Stations with Model Adaptation using Gaussian Process Regression" by M. Zagorowska et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) and mentions a "realistic load sharing problem in a compressor station," which suggests that there may be datasets related to compressor performance or operational data.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the motivation for improving energy efficiency in industrial operations and mention the use of Gaussian process regression. However, they do not explicitly mention any datasets in this section.

Moving on to the **methodology** and **results** sections, I will look for any specific datasets used for experiments or simulations. In the **results** section, the authors describe various scenarios and comparisons, but they do not provide explicit names of datasets. Instead, they refer to the performance of compressors and optimization results.

I will also check the **references** section for any cited datasets. The authors reference several studies and papers, but I need to determine if any of these references correspond to datasets that were used in their experiments.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will compile the information regarding datasets. If specific datasets are mentioned, I will ensure to include their full citations. For example, if the authors refer to a dataset from a previous study, I will extract the citation from the references section.

If I find any datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: If explicitly mentioned.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and contents.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is clear and concise, ready for further processing or review. If no datasets are explicitly mentioned, I will note that as well, indicating that the paper primarily discusses methodologies and results without providing specific datasets.
