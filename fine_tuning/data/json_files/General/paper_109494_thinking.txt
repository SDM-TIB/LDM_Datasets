To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Few-Shot Learning via Implanting and Compressing" by Yiting Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges of Incremental Few-Shot Learning (IFSL) and hints at the use of datasets for evaluation, but does not specify any names. The introduction elaborates on the problem but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1 (Dataset Setting)**, the authors explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Mini-ImageNet**: This dataset contains 100 classes with 500 images for training and 100 images for testing in each class. The authors split the dataset into 60 base classes and 40 novel classes for their experiments.

2. **CUB200**: This dataset is used for fine-grained image classification and contains 200 classes of birds. The authors mention that they split the dataset into 100 base classes and 100 novel classes.

3. **MS-COCO**: The authors describe how they split the 80 categories into base and novel classes for their experiments, indicating that this dataset is also utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Kavukcuoglu, K. (2016). *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

- For **CUB200**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Miller, D. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report, California Institute of Technology.

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., & Doll√°r, P. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
