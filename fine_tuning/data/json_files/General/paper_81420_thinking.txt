To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Survey of Modern Object Detection Literature using Deep Learning" by Karanbir Chahal and Kuntal Dey, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing specific models and methodologies** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on object detection algorithms but does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the context of the discussed algorithms. The introduction discusses the evolution of object detection but does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **sections detailing specific object detection models** (e.g., R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, SSD, YOLO, RetinaNet) to see if the authors mention datasets used for training or evaluation. Each model section may include references to datasets that are commonly used in the field.

As I review these sections, I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize datasets or their characteristics. For instance, if a table compares the performance of different models, it may also list the datasets on which these models were evaluated.

After identifying any datasets mentioned, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

If specific datasets are mentioned, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Clearly state the name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of images, types of annotations).
3. **Full Citation**: Include the complete citation for the dataset as it appears in the References section of the paper.

For example, if the paper mentions the COCO dataset, I would note:
- **Dataset Name**: COCO (Common Objects in Context)
- **Description**: A large-scale dataset containing images with object instances labeled for detection, segmentation, and captioning.
- **Full Citation**: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, Piotr Dollar. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
