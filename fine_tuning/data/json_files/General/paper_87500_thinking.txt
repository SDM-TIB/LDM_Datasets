To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of Narrow Lanes on Arterial Road Vehicle Crashes: A Machine Learning Approach" by Mohammed Elhenawy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used a "ten-year crash dataset in four cities in Nebraska," which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their analysis.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **methods** or **data analysis** sections. In the **data analysis** section, the authors mention that they aggregated observations from different years for each road section, resulting in a total of 1,818 observations after removing missing and duplicate data. This indicates that the dataset is derived from multiple years of crash data.

I will also check the **results** and **discussion** sections to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the dataset, such as its structure, variables included, or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for citation.

Since the paper does not explicitly provide a formal citation for the dataset used, I will need to create a citation based on the information available in the text. The dataset is described as a "ten-year crash dataset in four cities in Nebraska," but I will need to reference the original source of this data if it is available. If the dataset is derived from a public database or a government report, I will look for that information in the **references** section.

After gathering all relevant details, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the following:

1. **Dataset Name**: "Nebraska Crash Dataset"
2. **Description**: A ten-year dataset of vehicle crashes in four cities in Nebraska, containing 1,818 observations after data cleaning.
3. **Citation**: If the dataset is based on a specific report or database, I will format the citation accordingly. If no specific citation is provided, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' analysis of crash data.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details and citations before compiling them into a structured format for further use or review. This systematic approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical information regarding the datasets used in the research.
