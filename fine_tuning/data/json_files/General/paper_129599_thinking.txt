To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Locally Adaptive Federated Learning" by Sohom Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will take note of any datasets that are highlighted as being critical for their experiments or evaluations.

I will then examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, including any details about their size, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Machine Learning*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the References section of the paper.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
