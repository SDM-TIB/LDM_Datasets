To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Terrain Classification using Transfer Learning on Hyperspectral Images: A Comparative Study" by Uphar Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for classification.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of hyperspectral image classification and the need for labeled datasets. Here, I will look for specific dataset names or descriptions that indicate what data was used in their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They describe two datasets:

1. **Indian Pines Dataset**: This dataset is characterized by its spatial dimensions (145x145 pixels) and spectral bands (224 bands). The authors mention that it is used for training their models and provide details about the ground truth classes.

2. **University of Pavia Dataset**: This dataset has spatial dimensions of 610x610 pixels and 103 spectral bands. It is used for testing the models trained on the Indian Pines dataset, and the authors also provide information about the ground truth classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Indian Pines Dataset**, the citation is:
> Indian Pines. URL: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes.

For the **University of Pavia Dataset**, the citation is:
> Pavia University. URL: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php?title=Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Scenes.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the details, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the study.
