To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AddNet: Deep Neural Networks Using FPGA-Optimized Multipliers" by Julian Faraone et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract primarily discusses the methodology and results without mentioning specific datasets, so I will move on to the introduction. Here, I will look for any statements that indicate the use of datasets for training or evaluation purposes.

Next, I will check the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any standard datasets or benchmarks, I will note those down.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the paper discusses any specific datasets used for training or evaluation, I will ensure to capture the following details for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official title or commonly used name.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant annotations.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is both comprehensive and easy to understand.

Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any additional datasets that may have been mentioned in passing or in other sections, such as related work or conclusions. This thorough approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
