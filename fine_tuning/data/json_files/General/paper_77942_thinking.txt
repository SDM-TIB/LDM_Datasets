To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Searching for Activation Functions" by Prajit Ramachandran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical evaluations on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of activation functions and their evaluation on different tasks. They mention that the effectiveness of the discovered activation functions was validated on datasets like **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of how they benchmarked their proposed activation function, Swish, against various baseline activation functions on these datasets. They specifically mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** for image classification tasks and **ImageNet** for a more extensive evaluation. 

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009. (Note: CIFAR-100 is often referenced alongside CIFAR-10 as they share the same source.)

3. **ImageNet**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
