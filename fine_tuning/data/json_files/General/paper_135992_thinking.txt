To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Sobolev Pruning" by Neil Kichler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or case studies. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, it appears that the authors discuss their methodology and case studies, particularly in the context of option pricing models. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets mentioned in these sections, especially in the context of the Gaussian basket option pricing model.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will note any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their structure or content. For instance, if the authors refer to a dataset used for training or testing their models, I will document that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For example, if the paper references a dataset related to the Bachelier model or any other financial dataset, I will look for the original source of that dataset and provide the complete citation.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper "Towards Sobolev Pruning" by Neil Kichler et al.
