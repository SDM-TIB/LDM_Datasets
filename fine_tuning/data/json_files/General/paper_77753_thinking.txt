To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Principal Component Analysis" by Abubakar Abid et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the technique and mentions applications, which may hint at specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their analyses. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in **Table 1**, which summarizes the characteristics of the datasets used in their experiments. I will extract the names and details of these datasets from this table.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **MNIST on Grass**: This dataset consists of 5,000 synthetic images created by superimposing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset on images of grass from the ImageNet dataset. The authors reference the original MNIST dataset and the ImageNet dataset.

2. **Mice Protein Expression Dataset**: This dataset is adapted from a public dataset by Higuera et al. (2015) and consists of protein expression measurements of mice subjected to shock therapy.

3. **Single Cell RNA-Seq of Leukemia Patients**: This dataset includes single-cell RNA expression levels from bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) taken from leukemia patients, with data sourced from Zheng et al. (2017).

4. **Mexican Ancestry Dataset**: This dataset consists of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from individuals in Mexico, collected by Silva-Zolezzi et al. (2009).

5. **MHealth Sensors Dataset**: This dataset includes sensor measurements from various activities, referenced from Banos et al. (2015).

Now, I will look up the full citations for each of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
