To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Entailment as Few-Shot Learner" by Sinong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a systematic evaluation on **18 standard NLP tasks**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Data Statistics)**, the authors list various datasets along with their characteristics, such as the number of training and testing samples, types, and labels. This section is crucial for identifying the datasets utilized in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in the paper include:

1. **SST-2**: A sentiment classification dataset with 67,349 training samples and 872 testing samples, classified into positive and negative sentiments.
2. **MR**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 8,662 training samples and 2,000 testing samples, also classified into positive and negative sentiments.
3. **CR**: A dataset for opinion polarity with 1,775 training samples and 2,000 testing samples, classified as positive or negative.
4. **MPQA**: A dataset for opinion analysis with 8,606 training samples and 2,000 testing samples, classified into positive and negative opinions.
5. **Subj**: A subjectivity classification dataset with 8,000 training samples and 2,000 testing samples, classified into subjective and objective.
6. **OS**: A dataset for hate speech classification with 3,000 training samples and 2,000 testing samples, classified into hate speech and benign.
7. **IMDB**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 25,000 training samples and 25,000 testing samples, classified into positive and negative sentiments.
8. **CoLA**: A dataset for grammatical acceptability with 8,551 training samples and 1,042 testing samples, classified into grammatical and ungrammatical.
9. **Yelp**: A dataset for sentiment analysis with 600k training samples and 4,000 testing samples, classified into five-scale user sentiments.
10. **AG News**: A topic classification dataset with 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples, classified into world, sports, business, and science news.
11. **TREC**: A question classification dataset with 5,452 training samples and 500 testing samples, classified into various question types.
12. **QQP**: A paraphrase identification dataset with 363,846 training samples and 40,431 testing samples, classified into equivalent and not equivalent.
13. **MRPC**: A paraphrase identification dataset with 3,668 training samples and 408 testing samples, classified into equivalent and not equivalent.
14. **QNLI**: A natural language inference dataset with 104,743 training samples and 5,463 testing samples, classified into entailment, neutral, and contradiction.
15. **SNLI**: A natural language inference dataset with 549,367 training samples and 9,842 testing samples, classified into entailment, neutral, and contradiction.
16. **RTE**: A natural language inference dataset with 2,490 training samples and 277 testing samples, classified into entailment and not entailment.
17. **STS-B**: A sentence similarity dataset with 5,749 training samples and 3,270 testing samples, providing a continuous score.
18. **BoolQ**: A question answering dataset with 2,000 training samples and 1,000 testing samples, classified into yes or no.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are as follows:
