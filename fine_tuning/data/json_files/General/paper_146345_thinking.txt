To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distances between Extension Spaces" by Mar√≠a A. Valdez-Cabrera and Amy D. Willis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a summary of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the study. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Methods**, **Experiments**, or **Results**. In these sections, the authors often describe the datasets used for analysis, including their characteristics and any relevant citations.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or details provided by the authors. For example, if the authors mention a dataset used for phylogenetic analysis, I will look for details such as the number of samples, types of data included, and how the dataset was utilized in the research.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets for their own research or verification.

For instance, if the authors reference a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will ensure to find the complete citation, including the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a clear format, ready for any further processing or review.
