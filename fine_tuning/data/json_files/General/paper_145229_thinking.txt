To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VEGA: Learning Interleaved Image-Text Comprehension in Vision-Language Large Models" by Chenyu Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **VEGA**, specifically designed for the Interleaved Image-Text Comprehension (IITC) task. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Proposed Method)**, where the authors describe the VEGA dataset in detail. They mention that the VEGA dataset is composed of two subsets: one for the IITC task and another for the Image-Text Association (ITA) task. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **subsection 3.2 (Data Collection)**, the authors state that the VEGA dataset is built upon the **SciGraphQA dataset**, which is a multi-turn question-answering dataset for scientific graphs. They provide details about the number of entries and the types of data included in the VEGA dataset, such as images and questions.

I will also look into the **statistics section (3.3)**, where the authors provide quantitative details about the VEGA dataset, including the total number of entries, question-answer pairs, and images. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's scale and scope.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **VEGA Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the VEGA dataset itself, as it is a new dataset introduced in this paper. However, I will note that it is designed for the IITC task and is a significant contribution of this research.

2. **SciGraphQA Dataset**: The citation for the SciGraphQA dataset is:
   > Shengzhi Li and Nima Tajbakhsh. *SciGraphQA: A large-scale synthetic multi-turn question-answering dataset for scientific graphs*. arXiv, 2023.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets discussed in the paper along with their respective citations.
