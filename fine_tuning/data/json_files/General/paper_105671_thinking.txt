To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Adapter" by Rongsheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **SDA (Sentiment Domain Adaptation)**: This dataset consists of Amazon product reviews across four domains: Books, DVDs, Electronics, and Kitchen appliances. The authors note that there are 2,000 reviews with binary sentiment labels for each domain, and they provide details about the train/dev/test splits.

2. **XNLI (Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is used for a three-way classification task and includes texts in 15 languages. The authors specify the number of samples in the train, dev, and test sets for each language, indicating that English is treated as the source domain.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SDA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Blitzer, J., Dredze, M., & Pereira, F. (2007). Biographies, Bollywood, boom-boxes and blenders: Domain adaptation for sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 45th annual meeting of the association of computational linguistics (pp. 440-447).

- For the **XNLI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Conneau, A., Rinott, R., Lample, G., Williams, A., Bowman, S., Schwenk, H., & Stoyanov, V. (2018). XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2475-2485).

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
