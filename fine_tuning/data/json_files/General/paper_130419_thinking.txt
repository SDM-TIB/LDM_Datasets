To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RAHNet: Retrieval Augmented Hybrid Network for Long-tailed Graph Classification" by Zhengyang Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on various popular benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that summarizes the datasets, including details such as the number of graphs, classes, average nodes, and average edges.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned in **Table 1**:

1. **Synthie**: This dataset contains 400 graphs, 4 classes, with an average of 95 nodes and 172.93 edges.
2. **ENZYMES**: This dataset consists of 600 graphs, 6 classes, with an average of 32.63 nodes and 62.14 edges.
3. **MNIST**: This dataset includes 60,000 graphs, 10 classes, with an average of 75 nodes and 1393.27 edges.
4. **Letter-High**: This dataset has 2,250 graphs, 15 classes, with an average of 4.67 nodes and 4.50 edges.
5. **Letter-Low**: Similar to Letter-High, this dataset also contains 2,250 graphs, 15 classes, with the same average nodes and edges as Letter-High.
6. **COIL-DEL**: This dataset consists of 3,900 graphs, 100 classes, with an average of 21.54 nodes and 54.24 edges.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be included directly in the paper, but I will look for any references that might provide the necessary details.

For example, the **Synthie** dataset is often referenced in the context of synthetic datasets in graph classification, while the **ENZYMES** dataset is a well-known benchmark in bioinformatics. The **MNIST** dataset is widely recognized in the machine learning community, and its citation can be easily found in standard references. The **Letter** datasets and **COIL-DEL** are also established datasets in the field of pattern recognition.

After gathering the dataset names and their descriptions, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will include:

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
