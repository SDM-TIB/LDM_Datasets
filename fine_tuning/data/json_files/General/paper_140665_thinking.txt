To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StableGarment: Garment-Centric Generation via Stable Diffusion" by Rui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges and advancements in garment-centric generation tasks, which may hint at the datasets they utilized. I will pay close attention to any specific names or references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they mention two specific datasets for virtual try-on tasks: **VITON-HD** and **Dress Code**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their purpose and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

For the **VITON-HD dataset**, the citation is:
> Choi, S., Park, S., Lee, M., & Choo, J. (2021). VITON-HD: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 14131–14140.

For the **Dress Code dataset**, the citation is:
> Morelli, D., Fincato, M., Cornia, M., Landi, F., Cesari, F., & Cucchiara, R. (2022). Dress Code: High-resolution multi-category virtual try-on. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2231–2235.

Now that I have the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its purpose, and the corresponding citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a comprehensive overview for future reference or analysis.
