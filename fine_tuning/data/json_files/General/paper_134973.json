It contains the names of 500 villagers, where 100 villagers have 1 to 5 child(ren). Each villager has a unique full name consisting of a random combination of a first name and a last name. The training set sentences follow the template '[villager], who [desc], is the parent of [child]', where '[desc]' is a verb phrase about an attribute of the villager that is irrelevant to the parent-child relationship.",
