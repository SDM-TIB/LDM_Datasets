To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PoseMatcher: One-shot 6D Object Pose Estimation by Deep Feature Matching" by Pedro Castro and Tae-Kyun Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors outperform existing methods on the **Linemod** and **YCB-V** datasets, indicating that these datasets are relevant to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the **Google Scanned Objects** dataset, which contains 1023 household objects, and the **ShapeNet** dataset, which provides additional keypoints. This is crucial information for dataset extraction.

In section 4.4, the authors discuss their results on the **Linemod** and **YCB-V** datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. They also provide performance metrics for these datasets, which further validates their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned:

With these citations, I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets used in the paper. I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
