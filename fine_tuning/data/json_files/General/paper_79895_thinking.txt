To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ACDC: A Structured Efficient Linear Layer" by Marcin Moczulski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not mention specific datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in previous works, which could be relevant.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. If the authors conducted experiments that involve specific datasets, they will likely describe them in detail, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or their properties. These visual aids often provide concise information about the datasets used, including their sizes, types, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the paper mentions datasets like "ImageNet" or "MNIST," I will ensure to find their authoritative citations. For example, the citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
> Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. "ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database." In CVPR, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will format the dataset information according to the specified requirements, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation of each dataset.
