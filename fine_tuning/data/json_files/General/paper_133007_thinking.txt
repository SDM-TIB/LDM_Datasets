To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Increasing the Robustness of Predictive Steering-Control Autonomous Navigation Systems Against Dash Cam Image Angle Perturbations Due to Pothole Encounters" by Shivam Aarya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on publicly available datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at the **method section**, particularly the subsections where the author discusses the datasets used for training and testing their model. In this section, the author mentions using a dataset of potholes that includes 600 samples, which is split into training, validation, and testing groups. The details about the dataset composition and its purpose are crucial for understanding its application in the research.

Additionally, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any further mentions of datasets, especially regarding the dashcam images used for training the autoencoder model. The author specifies that they used datasets provided by Audi and Honda, which is significant for the analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. The citations are typically found in the **references section**. Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **Pothole Dataset**: This dataset consists of 600 samples of potholes, which are used to create 3D representations and analyze their effects on steering control. The author does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, but it is described in detail in the method section.

2. **Audi Dataset**: The citation for the Audi dataset is:
   > J. Geyer, Y. Kassahun, M. Mahmudi, X. Ricou, R. Durgesh, A. S. Chung, L. Hauswald, V. H. Pham, M. Mühlegg, S. Dorn, et al. "A2D2: Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset." arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.06320, 2020.

3. **Honda Dataset**: The citation for the Honda dataset is:
   > V. Ramanishka, Y.-T. Chen, T. Misu, and K. Saenko. "Toward Driving Scene Understanding: A Dataset for Learning Driver Behavior and Causal Reasoning." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018, pp. 7699–7707.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper attribution. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their relevance to the study's findings.
