To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics of Language Models: Part 1, Context-Free Grammar" by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Yuanzhi Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the construction of synthetic data for experiments, which suggests that there may be specific datasets created for the study.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors explain their research context. They mention using controlled experiments and synthetic data to study how generative language models learn context-free grammars (CFGs). This indicates that the datasets are likely synthetic and specifically designed for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **Appendix A**, the authors detail the construction of several synthetic CFGs, specifically mentioning the cfg3 family, which consists of seven datasets with varying levels of difficulty. The datasets are described as follows:

1. **cfg3b**: A dataset with a specific structure and size (1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3).
2. **cfg3i**: Similar to cfg3b but with different rules, making it more challenging.
3. **cfg3h**: A dataset with rules of varying lengths, increasing complexity.
4. **cfg3g**: Another dataset with a specific structure and size.
5. **cfg3f**: The most complex dataset in the cfg3 family, designed to test the limits of the model.

The authors also mention two additional families of datasets, **cfg8** and **cfg9**, which are constructed to explore different aspects of CFG learning.

Next, I will check the **references section** for full citations of the datasets. However, since these datasets are synthetic and created by the authors, they may not have external citations. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The full citations for the datasets based on the information provided in the paper are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
