To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Landscape Connectivity and Dropout Stability of SGD Solutions for Over-parameterized Neural Networks" by Alexander Shevchenko and Marco Mondelli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization landscape of neural networks and mentions validating theoretical findings with numerical experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their numerical experiments. I will note the context in which these datasets are used, particularly focusing on how they relate to the experiments conducted.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the tasks they performed using these datasets. For instance, they mention that they conducted classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR-10, which are standard datasets in machine learning for image classification.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for these datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available at: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
