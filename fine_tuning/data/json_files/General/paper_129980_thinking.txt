To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards General Game Representations: Decomposing Games Pixels into Content and Style" by Chintan Trivedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their hypotheses on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV.C (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Gen11 Dataset**: This dataset includes 110,000 images from 193 games across 11 different game genres, categorized by graphical styling (retro, modern, photorealistic). It is used for latent decomposition and style prediction.

2. **3D-SSL Dataset**: This dataset contains 40,608 images from 3 games across different genres, along with internal game state information such as player positions and other game objects. It is used for content extraction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly, but it references the **3D-SSL dataset** in a previous work by Trivedi et al. (2021). I will look for that citation:

- For **Gen11 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Trivedi, C., Liapis, A., & Yannakakis, G. N. (2021). Contrastive learning of generalized game representations. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Games.

- For **3D-SSL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Trivedi, C., Makantasis, K., Liapis, A., & Yannakakis, G. N. (2022). Learning task-independent game state representations from unlabeled images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Games.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
