To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Weight Activation Training" by Md Aamir Raihan and Tor M. Aamodt, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss evaluating their method on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** to gather more detailed information about how these datasets were utilized. The authors mention that they employed standard training schedules for training on **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, and they also reference **ImageNet** for their experiments. This confirms that these datasets are indeed used in their evaluations.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1097â€“1105, 2012.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation for CIFAR-100 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

3. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper references for future use.
