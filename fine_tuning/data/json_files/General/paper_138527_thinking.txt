To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fortifying Ethical Boundaries in AI: Advanced Strategies for Enhancing Security in Large Language Models" by Yunhong He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses various methodologies and mentions the use of datasets for experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their research. In **section 4.3 (Experimental Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized:

1. **Semi-Automatic Attack Prompt (SAP) Dataset**: This dataset series includes various sets of attack prompts designed for research, consolidated into a single dataset called SAP265, which contains a total of 2,120 task prompts.

2. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: This dataset is a comprehensive multitask accuracy test for text-based models, encompassing 57 diverse tasks that assess a model’s world knowledge and problem-solving capabilities.

3. **GQA (Generalized Question Answering)**: This dataset is designed to evaluate models with compositional questions tied to real-world images, comprising 22 million questions related to everyday imagery, each linked to a semantic blueprint for reasoning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Semi-Automatic Attack Prompt (SAP) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Deng, B., Wang, W., Feng, F., Deng, Y., Wang, Q., & He, X. (2023). Attack Prompt Generation for Red Teaming and Defending Large Language Models. In Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023, pp. 2176–2189. doi:10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.143.

- For the **MMLU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding.

- For the **GQA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hudson, D. A., & Manning, C. D. (2019). GQA: A New Dataset for Real-World Visual Reasoning and Compositional Question Answering.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
