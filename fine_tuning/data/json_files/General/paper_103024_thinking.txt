To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwinIR: Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer" by Jingyun Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three representative tasks: image super-resolution, image denoising, and JPEG compression artifact reduction. This indicates that there are likely datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) to identify specific datasets used for each task. In section 4.1, the authors mention that they trained their model on the **DIV2K dataset** for classical image super-resolution and tested it on the **Manga109 dataset**. This is a clear indication of two datasets being utilized.

I will also check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets mentioned for other tasks. In section 4.5, the authors discuss results for grayscale and color image denoising, referencing the **Set12**, **BSD68**, and **Urban100** datasets. This adds three more datasets to my list.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**:
   > Eirikur Agustsson and Radu Timofte. *Ntire 2017 challenge on single image super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pages 126–135, 2017.

4. **BSD68 Dataset**:

5. **Urban100 Dataset**:

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
