To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BLSP: Bootstrapping Language-Speech Pre-training via Behavior Alignment" by Chen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions leveraging existing ASR training data, which suggests that there are datasets related to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) involved. The introduction further emphasizes the use of cross-modal datasets, hinting at specific datasets that may be referenced later.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiment Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Training Details)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training their models. Here, they mention three key datasets:

1. **LibriSpeech**: A well-known ASR corpus based on public domain audiobooks, which is crucial for training speech recognition models.
2. **GigaSpeech**: An evolving, multi-domain ASR corpus with a large volume of transcribed audio, which is also utilized in their experiments.
3. **Common Voice 2.0**: A multilingual speech corpus that is used for training the modality adapter.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets in the **experiments** and **results** sections. The authors discuss their evaluation on various tasks, including speech recognition and translation, but the primary datasets mentioned for training are already captured.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **LibriSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *Librispeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In 2015 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206–5210, 2015.

- For **GigaSpeech**, the citation is:
  > Guoguo Chen, Shuzhou Chai, Guanbo Wang, Jiayu Du, Wei-Qiang Zhang, Chao Weng, Dan Su, Daniel Povey, Jan Trmal, Junbo Zhang, et al. *Gigaspeech: An evolving, multi-domain ASR corpus with 10,000 hours of transcribed audio*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2106.06909, 2021.

- For **Common Voice 2.0**, the citation is:
  > R. Ardila, M. Branson, K. Davis, M. Henretty, M. Kohler, J. Meyer, R. Morais, L. Saunders, F. M. Tyers, and G. Weber. *Common voice: A massively-multilingual speech corpus*. In Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2020), pages 4211–4215, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited, ready for further processing or review.
