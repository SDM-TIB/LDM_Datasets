To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cooperative Multi-Agent Transfer Learning with Level-Adaptive Credit Assignment" by Tianze Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses experiments conducted in the context of StarCraft II micro-management, which suggests that there may be specific datasets or benchmarks used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors refer to the **SMAC benchmark** as the evaluation framework for their experiments. This indicates that the SMAC benchmark is a dataset or a collection of scenarios used for testing their proposed methods.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SMAC benchmark. The relevant citation is:

- For the **SMAC benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Timo Ewalds, Sergey Bartunov, Petko Georgiev, Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets, Michelle Yeo, Alireza Makhzani, Heinrich KÃ¼ttler, John Agapiou, Julian Schrittwieser, et al. *Starcraft II: A new challenge for reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.04782, 2017.

After identifying the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The SMAC benchmark is a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark based on the real-time strategy game StarCraft II, which includes various scenarios for testing coordination and transfer learning in multi-agent systems.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in research contexts.
