To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIxBN: library for learning Bayesian networks from mixed data" by Anna V. Bubnova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract provides a brief overview of the library and its capabilities, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction discusses the need for mixed data representation but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results section**, particularly **section 5**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 5.1 (Datasets Description)**, the authors explicitly list five datasets:

1. **HEALTHCARE**: A synthetic dataset with 7 nodes (3 discrete and 4 continuous) and 3000 observations.
2. **SANGIOVESE**: Another synthetic dataset with 15 nodes (1 discrete and 14 continuous) and 3000 observations.
3. **MEHRA**: A synthetic dataset with 24 nodes (8 discrete and 16 continuous) and 3000 observations.
4. **Reservoirs**: A real dataset with 10 nodes (5 discrete and 5 continuous) and 514 observations.
5. **Social**: A real dataset with 8 nodes (4 discrete and 4 continuous) and 3789 observations.

The authors mention that the first three datasets (HEALTHCARE, SANGIOVESE, and MEHRA) are sampled from bnlearn networks, which allows for accurate comparisons due to known structures.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are either synthetic or real-world datasets that are commonly used in the field. Therefore, I will note that the synthetic datasets are derived from the bnlearn package, which is referenced in the paper.

The citation for the bnlearn package is:
> Marco Scutari, Maintainer Marco Scutari, and Hiton-PC MMPC. *Package ‘bnlearn’. Bayesian Network Structure Learning, parameter learning and inference, R package version, 4, 2020.*

For the real datasets (Reservoirs and Social), the paper does not provide specific citations, so I will note that they are used in the context of the experiments without specific references.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations as follows:

1. **HEALTHCARE**: Synthetic dataset with 7 nodes (3 discrete, 4 continuous), 3000 observations. Derived from bnlearn networks.
2. **SANGIOVESE**: Synthetic dataset with 15 nodes (1 discrete, 14 continuous), 3000 observations. Derived from bnlearn networks.
3. **MEHRA**: Synthetic dataset with 24 nodes (8 discrete, 16 continuous), 3000 observations. Derived from bnlearn networks.
4. **Reservoirs**: Real dataset with 10 nodes (5 discrete, 5 continuous), 514 observations. No specific citation provided.
5. **Social**: Real dataset with 8 nodes (4 discrete, 4 continuous), 3789 observations. No specific citation provided.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
