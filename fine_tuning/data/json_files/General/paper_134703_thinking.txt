To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DGAUnet: 3D generative adversarial networks with a 3D U-Net based generator to achieve the accurate and effective synthesis of clinical tumor image data for pancreatic cancer" by Yu Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a GAN-based model for generating 3D CT images of pancreatic tumors, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of limited clinical data for training deep learning models, indicating the need for datasets. I will look for specific datasets mentioned in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. They mention two sources of data:

1. **UNMC Rapid Autopsy Program (RAP)**: This dataset consists of 71 de-identified patient data with tumor contours labeled by clinical professionals. The authors note that this dataset is part of an IRB protocol.

2. **Medical Segmentation Decathlon Pancreas Training Data**: This dataset includes 103 volumetric images with segmentation masks of tumors and pancreas.

Both datasets are crucial for the training of the 3DGAUnet model, and I will ensure to note their details.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **UNMC Rapid Autopsy Program**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is referenced as part of an IRB protocol. I will note that this dataset is used under ethical guidelines.

For the **Medical Segmentation Decathlon**, the citation is:
> Antonelli, M.; Reinke, A.; Bakas, S.; Farahani, K.; Kopp-Schneider, A.; Landman, B.A.; Litjens, G.; Menze, B.; Ronneberger, O.; Summers, R.M.; et al. *The medical segmentation decathlon*. Nature communications 2022, 13, 4128.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
