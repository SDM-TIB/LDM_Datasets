To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Refinement Network for Oriented and Densely Packed Object Detection" by Xingjia Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors collected a new dataset called **SKU110K-R**, which is a relabeled version of the SKU110K dataset. This is a clear indication that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the datasets. The authors mention that they conducted experiments on several publicly available benchmarks, including **DOTA**, **HRSC2016**, and their own **SKU110K-R** dataset. This confirms the presence of multiple datasets.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.4 (SKU110K-R Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the SKU110K-R dataset, including its size, the number of images, and the nature of the annotations. They also mention that SKU110K-R is an extended version of the SKU110K dataset, which contains 11,762 images and 1,733,678 instances.

I will also look for the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used in the experiments. The authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on **DOTA**, **HRSC2016**, and **SKU110K-R**, which reinforces the datasets identified earlier.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **SKU110K Dataset**:
   > Eran Goldman, Roei Herzig, Aviv Eisenschtat, Jacob Goldberger, and Tal Hassner. *Precise detection in densely packed scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5227–5236, 2019.

2. **DOTA Dataset**:
   > Gui-Song Xia, Xiang Bai, Jian Ding, Zhen Zhu, Serge Belongie, Jiebo Luo, Mihai Datcu, Marcello Pelillo, and Liangpei Zhang. *DOTA: A large-scale dataset for object detection in aerial images*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3974–3983, 2018.

3. **HRSC2016 Dataset**:
   > Zikun Liu, Hongzhen Wang, Lubin Weng, and Yiping Yang. *Ship rotated bounding box space for ship extraction from high-resolution optical satellite images with complex backgrounds*. IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, 13(8):1074–1078, 2016.

4. **SKU110K-R Dataset**:
   Since SKU110K-R is a relabeled version of SKU110K, I will use the same citation as SKU110K.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
