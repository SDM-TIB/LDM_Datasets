To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Cross-Language Investigation into Jailbreak Attacks in Large Language Models" by Yi Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a **multilingual jailbreak dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. I will note this down as a potential dataset to explore further.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology section**, specifically **section 3 (Dataset Construction)**. Here, the authors describe their process for creating the multilingual dataset. They mention that they developed a dataset of **multilingual malicious questions** using a semantic-preserving algorithm. This section will likely provide detailed information about the dataset, including its structure and the languages involved.

In **sub-section 3.3.1 (Data Collection)**, the authors specify that they selected **nine languages**: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Arabic, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, and Swahili. They also mention that they compiled **745 malicious English questions** from existing literature, which serves as the foundation for their dataset. This is crucial information for describing the dataset.

In **sub-section 3.3.2 (Semantic-preserving Multilingual Dataset Construction)**, the authors detail their algorithm for translating these questions into the selected languages while maintaining semantic fidelity. They state that they ended up with **365 multilingual question combinations**, which forms the core of their dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to prior studies from which they compiled the malicious questions. I will look for these references to ensure I have the correct citations.

The references that are particularly relevant for the dataset are:

1. **Malicious Questions Dataset**: The authors cite previous studies that contributed to their dataset construction. For example:
   > Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Zhengzi Xu, Yuekang Li, Yaowen Zheng, Ying Zhang, Lida Zhao, Tianwei Zhang, and Yang Liu. *Jailbreaking ChatGPT via Prompt Engineering: An Empirical Study*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.13860, 2023.

2. **Semantic-preserving Algorithm**: The algorithm used for dataset construction is likely based on existing methodologies, but the paper does not provide a specific citation for it. However, I will note that it is a novel contribution of this study.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Multilingual Malicious Questions Dataset**: This dataset consists of 365 multilingual questions generated from an initial set of 745 malicious questions in English, translated into nine languages using a semantic-preserving algorithm.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.
