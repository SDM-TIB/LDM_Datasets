To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrated Path Stability Selection" by Omar Melikechi and Jeffrey W. Miller, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method is demonstrated on "simulations and real data from cancer gene expression studies." This indicates that there are datasets related to cancer gene expression that I need to look for.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on any subsections that discuss data or datasets. In the introduction, the authors refer to "real data from cancer gene expression studies," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 6 (Applications)**, the authors describe their application of the proposed method to two datasets:
1. **Prostate cancer dataset**: This dataset consists of expression levels of 125 genes in 348 prostate cancer patients, using RPPA data. The authors mention that the response variable is tumor purity.
2. **Colon cancer dataset**: This dataset includes expression levels of 1908 genes in 62 tissue samples (40 cancerous and 22 normal), which is used to identify genes whose expression levels differ between cancerous and normal samples.

I will now look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation.

For the **Prostate cancer dataset**, the citation is:
> Vasaikar, S. V., Straub, P., Wang, J., & Zhang, B. (2018). LinkedOmics: analyzing multi-omics data within and across 32 cancer types. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 46(D1), D956–D963.

For the **Colon cancer dataset**, the citation is:
> Alon, U., Barkai, N., Notterman, D. A., Gish, K., Ybarra, S., Mack, D., & Levine, A. J. (1999). Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays. *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 96(12), 6745–6750.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work.
