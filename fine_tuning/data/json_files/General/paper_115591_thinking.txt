To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Transformer for Soil Classification" by Aaryan Jagetia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research involves a dataset of soil images, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Proposed Work)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **Soil Dataset**. They describe it as containing images of four different types of soil: alluvial, red, black, and clay. The dataset consists of approximately 1000 photos, and it is noted that it is balanced, meaning each soil type has a roughly equal number of samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Soil Dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is:
> Soil Dataset Available: https://urlcc.cc/93fjh

Since the dataset is the primary focus of the research, I will ensure to include this citation in my final output.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, the types of soil included, and the number of images. This will help in creating a comprehensive entry for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
