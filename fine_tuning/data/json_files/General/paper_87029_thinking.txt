To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A First-Order Algorithmic Framework for Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Logistic Regression" by Jiajin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using various datasets, including:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated synthetic datasets for their experiments, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets since they are created for the purpose of the study.

2. **Real Datasets**: The authors mention using datasets from LIBSVM, specifically the UCI adult datasets (a1a to a9a). They also refer to the MNIST dataset for various binary classification tasks.

In the **References section**, I will look for citations related to the datasets mentioned. For the UCI adult datasets, the citation is typically attributed to the original source of the dataset, which is:

- For the UCI Adult dataset:
  > Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

- For the MNIST dataset, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. (1998). *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, so I will note that they were generated for the study.

In summary, I will document the following datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: Generated for the experiments (no citation).
2. **UCI Adult Datasets**: 
   > Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
3. **MNIST Dataset**: 
   > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., and Burges, C. (1998). *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
