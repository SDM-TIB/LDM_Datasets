To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Comparing Fair Classifiers under Data Bias" by Mohit Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, specifically naming **Adult**, **German Credit**, **Bank Marketing**, and **COMPAS** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the study.

Next, I will look into the **experimental setup** section (Section 3) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide context for each:

1. **Adult Income Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on various attributes. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. [Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

2. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Moro, S., Cortez, P., & Rita, P. (2014). A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing. *Decision Support Systems*, 62, 22-31.

3. **COMPAS Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting recidivism. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Angwin, J., Larson, J., Mattu, S., & Kirchner, L. (2016). Machine bias. *ProPublica*.

4. **German Credit Dataset**: This dataset is used to assess credit risk. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. [German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)).

5. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset setup based on the work of Zeng et al. (2022). The citation for this dataset is:
   > Zeng, X., Dobriban, E., & Cheng, G. (2022). Bayes-optimal classifiers under group fairness. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.09724.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to verify their descriptions and citations against the **References section** of the paper to confirm accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
