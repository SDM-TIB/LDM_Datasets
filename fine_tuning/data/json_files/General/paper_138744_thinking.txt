To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RepQuant: Towards Accurate Post-Training Quantization of Large Transformer Models via Scale Reparameterization" by Zhikai Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. In this section, the authors mention evaluating their method on various tasks, including vision, language, and multi-modal transformers. I will look for specific dataset names associated with these tasks.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention several datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: Used for image classification tasks with vision transformers.
2. **COCO**: Used for object detection and instance segmentation tasks.
3. **WikiText2**: Used for language generation tasks.
4. **Penn Treebank**: Another dataset for language generation tasks.
5. **C4**: Used for language generation tasks.
6. **CIFAR100**: Used for zero-shot image classification tasks with the CLIP model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
