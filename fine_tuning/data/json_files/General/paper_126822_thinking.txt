To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Boost Vision Transformer with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization" by Chong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on **ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation** tasks. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks are likely used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the experimental results, as they often include dataset names.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks and contains millions of labeled images across thousands of categories.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for object detection and segmentation tasks and includes images with complex scenes containing multiple objects.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and contains images annotated with object and stuff categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, et al. *Semantic Understanding of Scenes through the ADE20K Dataset*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 127(3):302–321, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize this information clearly, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name and full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
