To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TreeSegNet: Adaptive Tree CNNs for Subdecimeter Aerial Image Segmentation" by Kai Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ISPRS Potsdam dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.2, the authors explicitly state that they used the **ISPRS Potsdam 2D semantic labeling dataset** for their experiments. They describe the dataset as containing 38 image patches, each with a resolution of 6000 Ã— 6000 pixels, and detail the classes included in the dataset.

I will also check the **implementation details** section (section 4) for any additional information about the dataset, such as preprocessing steps or specific characteristics that might be relevant for understanding its use in the experiments.

In section 5.2, the authors provide a comprehensive description of the Potsdam dataset, including the number of labeled and unlabeled patches, the types of images (true orthophoto and digital surface model), and the classes represented (impervious surfaces, buildings, low vegetation, trees, cars, and clutter). This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISPRS Potsdam dataset. The authors acknowledge the provision of the dataset by ISPRS and BSF Swiss photo, but they do not provide a specific citation in the references. Therefore, I will look for the official ISPRS documentation or website to obtain the correct citation format.

The citation for the ISPRS Potsdam dataset is:
> ISPRS. *ISPRS 2D Semantic Labeling Contest*. [Online]. Available: https://www.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/2D_Semantic_Labeling_Contest.aspx

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ISPRS Potsdam dataset, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
