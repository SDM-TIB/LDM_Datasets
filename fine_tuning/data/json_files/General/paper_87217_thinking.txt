To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Contrastive Learning and Nonlinear ICA in the Presence of Outliers" by Hiroaki Sasaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, size, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss the application of the proposed methods to real-world data, as these often include datasets that are critical to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the **Hippocampal fMRI dataset**, I will look for the complete citation in the references. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will note the details provided in the text and search for the original source if necessary.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset information is clearly organized and ready for any further processing or review.
