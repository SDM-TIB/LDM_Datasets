To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alternative formulations for gilthead seabream diets: Towards a more sustainable production" by Cláudia Aragão et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's aim and methodology, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for alternative ingredients in aquaculture diets, which suggests that they may have conducted experiments involving specific datasets related to fish diets and performance.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly the subsection on experimental diets. Here, the authors describe four different diets (CTRL, PLANT, PAP, EMERG) formulated for the growth trial. Each diet's composition is detailed, which indicates that the data collected during the experiment will be relevant.

I will then examine the **results section**, where the authors present findings related to growth performance, nutrient retention, and digestibility coefficients. This section often contains tables and figures summarizing the data collected during the experiments, which are crucial for understanding the datasets.

The **discussion section** may provide insights into how the datasets were interpreted and their implications for aquaculture practices. It may also reference other studies that used similar datasets, which can be useful for citation purposes.

Throughout this process, I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the experimental data, as these often contain the most relevant information regarding the datasets.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies mentioned in the paper. This is critical for ensuring that I can provide accurate and complete citations for each dataset.

For example, if the authors mention specific datasets related to the diets tested, I will look for the original sources of those datasets, such as previous studies or established databases.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description of the dataset, its purpose, and the full citation for each dataset used in the study.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the research paper effectively, ensuring that I provide comprehensive and accurate information.
