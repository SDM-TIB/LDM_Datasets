To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Weakly-Supervised Learning Methods for Classification and Localization in Histology Images: a Survey" by Jérôme Rony et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors assess various weakly-supervised learning models on several public benchmark histology datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a brief description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **BreaKHis Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,909 images of breast cancer histopathology, categorized into two classes: benign and malignant. The authors refer to the original paper for more details.

2. **BACH (Part A) Dataset**: This dataset includes 400 training images and 100 test images for breast cancer classification, distributed evenly among four classes: normal, benign, in situ, and invasive. The authors also reference the original challenge paper for further information.

3. **GlaS Dataset**: Comprising 165 images for colon cancer diagnosis, this dataset has both image-level and pixel-level annotations. The authors provide a citation for the original dataset paper.

4. **CAMELYON16 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 399 whole slide images (WSIs) for detecting metastases in lymph nodes, with both image-level and pixel-level annotations. The authors mention a specific protocol for sampling patches from this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **BreaKHis Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Spanhol, F. A., Oliveira, L. S., Petitjean, C., & Heutte, L. (2016). A dataset for breast cancer histopathological image classification. *IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering*, 63(7), 1455-1462.

- For the **BACH Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aresta, G., Araújo, T., Kwok, S., et al. (2018). Bach: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images. *CoRR*, abs/1808.04277.

- For the **GlaS Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **CAMELYON16 Dataset**, the citation is:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
