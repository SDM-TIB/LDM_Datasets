To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision Transformers For Weeds and Crops Classification Of High Resolution UAV Images" by Reenul Reedha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the classification of images of weeds and crops, which suggests that a dataset is involved, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the **Image collection and annotation** subsection. Here, the authors describe the acquisition of images from UAVs and mention that the data was manually labeled into five classes: weeds, beet, off-type beet, parsley, and spinach. This indicates that a custom dataset has been created for their experiments.

I will look for specific details about the dataset, such as the number of images, the classes included, and any preprocessing steps mentioned. The paper states that the dataset consists of 19,265 images, categorized into five classes, with each class containing between 3,265 to 4,000 images. This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will also check the **Results** and **Discussion** sections to see if the authors reference any existing datasets or benchmarks they compared their results against. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on their custom dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. Since the authors created their own dataset, I will note that the citation for this dataset will be based on the paper itself.

The full citation for the custom dataset is:
> Reedha, R., Dericquebourg, E., Canals, R., & Hafiane, A. (2023). Vision Transformers For Weeds and Crops Classification Of High Resolution UAV Images. *INSA CVL, University of Orleans, PRISME EA 4229, Bourges, France*.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation and relevant details about the dataset's composition and characteristics.
