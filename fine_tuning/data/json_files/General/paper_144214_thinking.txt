To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstructionCP: A fast approach to transfer Large Language Models into target language" by Kuang-Ming Chen and Hung-yi Lee, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Training Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for training their model. Here, they mention a high-quality dataset comprising paired instruction-following data for LLaMA3-instruct, specifically highlighting that it consists of Traditional Chinese text totaling 0.1 billion tokens. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **evaluation dataset subsection (4.2)**. The authors refer to several benchmarks used to evaluate their model, such as **TruthfulQA**, **ToxiGen**, and **MT-Bench**. Each of these benchmarks serves as a dataset for evaluating the model's performance in various aspects.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. For instance, the citation for **TruthfulQA** is:
> Lin, S., Hilton, J., & Evans, O. (2022). TruthfulQA: Measuring how models mimic human falsehoods.

For **ToxiGen**, the citation is:
> Hartvigsen, T., Gabriel, S., Palangi, H., Sap, M., Ray, D., & Kamar, E. (2022). Toxigen: A large-scale machine-generated dataset for adversarial and implicit hate speech detection. In Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT â€™21. ACM.

For **MT-Bench**, the citation is:
> Zheng, L., Chiang, W.-L., Sheng, Y., Zhuang, S., Wu, Z., Zhuang, Y., et al. (2023). Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
