To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical-level rain image generative model based on GAN" by Zhenyuan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a generative model and the collection of natural rain images for training and validation. This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to identify their specific names and details.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset and evaluation metrics)**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and introduce their own dataset. Here, they mention the construction of a **Natural Multilevel Rain Dataset (NMRD)**, which is crucial for their research. The section provides details about the dataset, including the categories of images collected (sunny day, light rain, medium rain, and heavy rain) and the number of images in each category.

The authors also compare their dataset with existing datasets in **Table 2**, which highlights the differences in labeling and authenticity. This comparison is important for understanding the context and significance of the NMRD.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several existing datasets, and I will extract the citations from the **References section**:

9. **NMRD (Natural Multilevel Rain Dataset)**: This dataset is constructed by the authors, so it does not have an external citation but should be described in detail as it is central to their research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
