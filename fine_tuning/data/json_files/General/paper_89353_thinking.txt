To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lookahead: A Far-Sighted Alternative of Magnitude-Based Pruning" by Sejun Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on several neural network architectures, including fully-connected networks (FCN), convolutional networks (Conv-6), VGG, and ResNet. They specify the datasets used for training these models:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for handwritten digit classification. The authors state that the FCN was trained on the MNIST dataset.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The authors mention that the Conv-6, VGG, and ResNet models were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet Dataset**: This dataset is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images per class. The authors indicate that VGG, ResNet, and Wide ResNet were trained on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 1998.

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Tiny-ImageNet visual recognition challenge, available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
