To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformer: Towards Displacement Field Learning for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration" by Jiashun Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on two public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically section 3, where the authors describe the datasets used for validation. Here, they mention two datasets: 

1. **LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40)**: This dataset consists of 40 3D volumes of whole-brain MRI scans from normal volunteers, divided into training, validation, and testing sets. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps and the ground truth annotations.

2. **Neurite subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (Neurite-OASIS)**: This dataset includes 414 inter-patient 3D T1-weighted MRI brain scans from subjects with various stages of cognitive decline. The authors also describe the preprocessing and the ground truth segmentation maps provided.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For the **LPBA40 dataset**, the citation is:
> Shattuck, D.W., Mirza, M., Adisetiyo, V., Hojatkashani, C., Salamon, G., Narr, K.L., Poldrack, R.A., Bilder, R.M., Toga, A.W. (2008). Construction of a 3D probabilistic atlas of human cortical structures. *Neuroimage*, 39(3), 1064–1080.

For the **Neurite-OASIS dataset**, the citation is:
> Marcus, D.S., Wang, T.H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J.G., Morris, J.C., Buckner, R.L. (2007). Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience*, 19(9), 1498–1507.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset used in the research.
