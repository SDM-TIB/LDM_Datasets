To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Drive-thru Recommendation Service at Fast Food Restaurants" by Luyang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the recommendation system but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction discusses the challenges of data availability in the drive-thru context, which suggests that the authors may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiment Results)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the dataset is constructed from **Burger King’s customer drive-thru transaction records** over the past year. This indicates that the dataset is proprietary and specific to Burger King, which is important to note.

In this section, the authors detail how they formed an add-to-cart event sequence for each order and used various context features such as weather descriptions, order time, and current temperature. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in the study.

Since the dataset is proprietary and specific to Burger King, I will not find a traditional citation in the references section. However, I will still document the dataset's details as follows:

1. **Burger King Drive-thru Transaction Dataset**: This dataset consists of customer transaction records from Burger King’s drive-thru service over the past year. It includes order sequences and contextual features such as weather and time.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the relevant details, ensuring to include the context of its use in the experiments and the proprietary nature of the dataset.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that it is clear and comprehensive.
