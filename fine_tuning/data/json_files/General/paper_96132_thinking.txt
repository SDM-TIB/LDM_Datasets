To extract datasets from the chapter titled "Machine Translation of Novels in the Age of Transformer" by Antonio Toral et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **introduction and systems and data sections** of the chapter. The introduction provides context about the research focus, while the systems and data section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 3.1 (Data)**, the authors mention three types of datasets used in their experiments:

1. **Training Data**: This dataset comprises 133 parallel novels, which include over 1 million sentence pairs, and around 1,000 monolingual novels in the target language, totaling over 5 million sentences. Additionally, they use generic datasets, both parallel (0.4 million sentence pairs) and monolingual (16 million sentences).

2. **Development Data**: This dataset consists of 2,000 sentence pairs randomly selected from the parallel training data, which were removed from it for evaluation purposes.

3. **Test Data**: This dataset includes 12 English novels and their translations into Catalan by professional literary translators. It also includes the short story "Adventure II: The Yellow Face" from the *Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle.

Next, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section**. The authors reference previous works that likely contain the necessary citations for the novels and datasets used.

For the **12 English novels**, I will need to identify the specific titles and their corresponding translations. The chapter does not provide explicit titles, so I will note that I need to search for these in the references or related works by the authors.

For the **short story "Adventure II: The Yellow Face"**, I can provide the citation as follows:
> Doyle, Arthur Conan. *The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes*. London: George Newnes Ltd, 1893.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets, ensuring I include the full citations where available. If specific titles for the 12 novels are not mentioned in the chapter, I will note that they need to be sourced from the references or other related literature.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each entry is clear and includes all necessary citation information.
