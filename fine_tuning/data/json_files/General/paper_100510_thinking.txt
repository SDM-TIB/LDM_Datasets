To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel 3D-UNet Deep Learning Framework Based on High-Dimensional Bilateral Grid for Edge Consistent Single Image Depth Estimation" by Mansi Sharma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the **NYUv2-Depth data**, indicating that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of monocular depth estimation and reference the **NYU-Depth V2 dataset** as a benchmark for their evaluation. This reinforces the idea that this dataset is central to their work.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about their implementation and mention that they trained their models on a subset of the **NYU-Depth V2 dataset**, specifically using around 20K samples for training and 694 samples for testing. This confirms the dataset's relevance and usage in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NYU-Depth V2 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> N. Silberman, D. Hoiem, P. Kohli, and R. Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In Proceedings of the 12th European conference on Computer Vision, Volume Part V. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, 746â€“760, 2014.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the NYU-Depth V2 dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset, ensuring to include the full citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
