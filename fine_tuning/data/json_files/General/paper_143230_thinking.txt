To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CaFA: Global Weather ForeCasting with Factorized Attention on Sphere" by Zijie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of a model validated on **WeatherBench2 (Rasp et al., 2023)**, which indicates that this is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any additional datasets. The introduction discusses the use of historical weather records and mentions the **ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2020)**, which is another dataset that is crucial for the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific details about how these datasets were used in the experiments. The authors state that they trained their model on the **ERA5 reanalysis data** from 1979 to 2019, which confirms its significance in the research.

Moving to the **experiments section**, I will check for any further mentions of datasets. The authors refer to **WeatherBench2** as the benchmark dataset used for evaluation, which is essential for understanding the model's performance.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **WeatherBench2**:
   > Rasp, S., Hoyer, J., Merose, A., Langmore, I., Battaglia, P., Thiemert, D., Agrawal, S., Chantry, M., Bouallegue, Z. B., Dueben, P., Bromberg, C., Sisk, J., Barrington, A., Bell, F., & Sha, F. (2023). WeatherBench 2: A benchmark for the next generation of data-driven global weather models. *Weather and Forecasting*, 38(2), 1-20. DOI: 10.1175/WAF-D-22-00123.1.

2. **ERA5 Reanalysis Data**:
   > Hersbach, H., Bell, R., Berrisford, P., Hirahara, S., Horányi, A., Muñoz-Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Dee, D., & others. (2020). The ERA5 global reanalysis. *Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society*, 146(730), 1999-2049. DOI: 10.1002/qj.3803.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for further processing or review.
