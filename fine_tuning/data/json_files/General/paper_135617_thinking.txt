To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RainAI - Precipitation Nowcasting from Satellite Data" by Rafael Pablos Sarabia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper addresses the Weather4Cast 2023 competition, which suggests that there is a specific dataset associated with this competition.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Weather4Cast Challenge & Dataset)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. Here, the authors describe the task of predicting rainfall using satellite and radar images. They mention that the organizers provide satellite and radar images for 7 regions in Europe, which is a clear indication of a dataset.

In this section, the authors provide specifics about the dataset:
- The dataset includes satellite data obtained from geostationary satellites operated by EUMETSAT, with a spatial resolution of about 12 x 12 kmÂ² and a temporal resolution of 15 minutes. 
- It covers 7 regions in Europe from February 2019 to December 2020, with additional data for 2021 for evaluating spatial and temporal transfer learning.
- The dataset consists of 228,928 training sequences and 840 predefined sequences for validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the Weather4Cast dataset itself, as it is likely a competition dataset. However, I will note the relevant references that may be associated with the methodologies or datasets used in the context of precipitation nowcasting.

The relevant references include:
- **Weather4Cast 2023 Competition**: This is the competition dataset, but it may not have a formal citation as it is provided by the competition organizers.
- **EUMETSAT**: The satellite data is sourced from EUMETSAT, which may not have a specific citation in the paper but is an important source of the dataset.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:
1. **Weather4Cast 2023 Dataset**: Contains satellite and radar images for 7 regions in Europe, spanning from February 2019 to December 2020, with additional data for 2021. The dataset is used for precipitation nowcasting in the competition.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that captures the essential details, including the dataset name, description, and any relevant citations or sources, even if they are not formal citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
