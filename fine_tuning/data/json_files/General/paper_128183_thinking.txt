To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Large-Scale Study of Probabilistic Calibration in Neural Network Regression" by Victor Dheur and Souhaib Ben Taieb, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted the largest empirical study to assess the probabilistic calibration of neural networks using **57 tabular datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Are Neural Regression Models Probabilistically Calibrated?)**, where the authors discuss the datasets in detail. They mention that they analyze a total of **57 datasets**, including those from the **OpenML curated benchmark**, the **AutoML Repository**, and the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. This section is crucial as it likely contains the specific names of the datasets.

In the paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 1**. I will carefully extract the names of the datasets listed there, along with their sources. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **OpenML 297**: A dataset related to wine quality.
2. **OpenML 299**: Another dataset from the OpenML repository.
3. **UCI Machine Learning Repository**: Various datasets such as **Kin8nm**, **Energy**, **Crime**, **Fish**, and others.

I will also note that the authors have prioritized certain datasets based on their relevance and previous studies, which is important for understanding the context of their analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets. 

For example, if the paper cites the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, I will look for the original source or publication associated with each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

Once I have gathered all the dataset names and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format that includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Focus on section 4 and Table 1 for detailed dataset information.
3. Extract dataset names and their sources.
4. Look up full citations in the References section.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and completeness.
