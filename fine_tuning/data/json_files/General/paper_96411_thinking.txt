To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic RAN Slicing for Service-Oriented Vehicular Networks via Constrained Learning" by Wen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using two real-world vehicle traffic flow traces for their simulations: the **highway trace** and the **urban trace**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, collection methods, and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the highway trace as data collected by Alberta Transportation, which records hourly vehicle traffic flow on Highway 2A in Canada over a specific period. The urban trace is described as data collected by Didi Chuxing GAIA Initiative, which tracks taxis equipped with GPS devices in urban areas of Xiâ€™an, China.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are derived from specific organizations or initiatives, I will ensure to format the citations correctly.

1. **Highway Trace Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Alberta Transportation. *Highway 2A Traffic Flow Data*. [Online]. Available: http://www.transportation.alberta.ca/mapping/.

2. **Urban Trace Dataset**: 
   - Citation: Didi Chuxing. *GAIA Initiative Vehicle Traffic Data*. [Online]. Available: https://gaia.didichuxing.com.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
