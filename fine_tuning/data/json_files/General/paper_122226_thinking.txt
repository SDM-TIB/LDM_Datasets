To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Text recognition on images using pre-trained CNN" by Afgani Fajar Rizky et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the research uses the **Chars74K dataset** for training and the **IIIT-5K-Dataset** for testing. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of text recognition and mentions various datasets, but it primarily reiterates the use of Chars74K and IIIT-5K-Dataset.

I will then focus on the **method** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **Chars74K**: This dataset contains character images, including handwritten, computer font, and scene text images. It focuses on recognizing characters in challenging situations for OCR techniques. The dataset consists of alphabetic images with 36 labels (26 letters and 10 digits).

2. **IIIT 5K-word**: This dataset is collected from Google Image search results and contains 5000 word text images from various outdoor environments. It is specifically designed for recognizing text in natural scene images.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **Chars74K**, the citation is:
  > T. E. de Campos, B. Rakesh Babu, and M. Varma. "CHARACTER RECOGNITION IN NATURAL IMAGES." 2009. Available: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/

- For **IIIT 5K-word**, the citation is:
  > A. Mishra, K. Alahari, and C. v Jawahar. "Scene Text Recognition using Higher Order Language Priors." 2012. Available: http://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~anand.mishra/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its purpose and citation, ready for any downstream tasks or documentation.
