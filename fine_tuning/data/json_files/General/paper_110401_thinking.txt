To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An interpretable machine learning approach for ferroalloys consumptions" by Nick Knizev, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions a method for modeling and optimizing ferroalloys consumption based on historical data from sensors, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **data description sections**. In the introduction, the author discusses the use of machine learning in industry and mentions the need for predictive models based on historical data. However, specific datasets are not named here.

In the **data description section**, the author provides more details about the dataset used in the study. The paper states that the dataset contains element share information during the melt process for various elements (Al, Mn, Si, C, S) and other relevant parameters such as temperature and scrap information. However, it is noted that the actual data is confidential and cannot be shared. This indicates that while a dataset is used, it is not publicly available.

The author also mentions that they have about 100,000 melts, generating approximately 150,000 samples in total, but again, this data is confidential. The paper expresses hope to show results on public datasets in the future, but no specific public datasets are mentioned.

Since the paper does not provide any publicly available datasets or their citations, I will note that the dataset used is proprietary and cannot be cited. However, I will still document the information provided about the dataset in a structured manner.

Finally, I will compile the findings into a summary that reflects the dataset information extracted from the paper, ensuring to highlight the confidentiality of the data and the lack of public citations.
