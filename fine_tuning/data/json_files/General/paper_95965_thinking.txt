To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis of Vietnamese Reviews" by Quoc Thai Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented with two datasets for sentiment analysis of Vietnamese reviews, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments & Discussions)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. They describe two datasets:

1. **Ntc-sv2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 samples of reviews about food and restaurants from the Foody platform. The reviews are labeled based on average scores, with scores above 8.5 labeled as positive and those below 5 labeled as negative.

2. **Vreview Dataset**: This dataset is built from user comments on various e-commerce sites and includes reviews about food and restaurants. It has a similar labeling system, with scores above 7.5 labeled as positive and those below 5 labeled as negative.

The authors also provide some statistics about the datasets, confirming their relevance and the number of samples in each category.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely original datasets created by the authors for this study. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are not formally cited in the references.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant statistics, ensuring to include the context of their use in the study. I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing, keeping in mind the importance of clear and accurate descriptions.

In summary, I will compile the information about the datasets as follows:

1. **Ntc-sv2 Dataset**: 50,000 samples of reviews about food and restaurants on Foody, labeled based on average scores (positive if >8.5, negative if <5).

2. **Vreview Dataset**: User comments from various e-commerce sites, including food and restaurant reviews, labeled similarly (positive if >7.5, negative if <5).

Since these datasets are original to the study, I will note that they do not have formal citations but are critical to the research findings presented in the paper.
