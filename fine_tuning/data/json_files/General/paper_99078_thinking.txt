To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Collaborative Cloud and Edge Mobile Computing in C-RAN Systems with Minimal End-to-End Latency" by Seok-Hwan Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Methodology."** These sections often detail the datasets used for validation or experimentation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that may summarize dataset characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to mobile cloud computing, edge computing, or any performance metrics that might involve datasets. If the authors reference any existing datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

If the paper mentions datasets such as simulation results or synthetic datasets created for the study, I will ensure to document these as well, including any relevant parameters or configurations used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized for further research.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of dataset information from the paper while maintaining proper citation practices.
