To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weighted Concordance Index Loss-based Multimodal Survival Modeling for Radiation Encephalopathy Assessment in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Radiotherapy" by Jiansheng Fang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on a **private dataset**, which suggests that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of predicting radiation encephalopathy (REP) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients and mention the types of data they are using, including imaging and non-imaging data. However, they do not specify the dataset name here.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (NPC-REP Dataset Acquisition)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail. They mention that they acquired data from **4,816 patients** from a cancer center, which includes diagnosis and treatment data related to NPC radiotherapy. They also explain how they binarized labels for patients based on REP confirmation and recorded time intervals for follow-up.

The dataset is referred to as the **NPC-REP dataset**, which is crucial for my extraction. I will note down the details provided about the dataset, including the number of patients and the types of data collected (CT images, radiotherapy dose images, demographic characteristics, etc.).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NPC-REP dataset. However, since this dataset is described as a private dataset, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. In this case, I will note that the dataset is private and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **NPC-REP Dataset**: A private dataset consisting of 4,816 patients with data on diagnosis and treatment related to NPC radiotherapy. The dataset includes imaging data (CT, RD, RS images) and non-image data (demographic characteristics and dose-volume histogram features).

Since the NPC-REP dataset does not have a formal citation, I will indicate that it is a private dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
