To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting PaLM for Translation: Assessing Strategies and Performance" by David Vilar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the methodologies and datasets employed, which can give me initial clues about what to look for.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, there is a section titled **4 Data**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. I will read through this section carefully to identify any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In the **Data section**, the authors mention using **WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) test sets** for evaluating translation quality. They specify the years of the datasets and the language pairs involved. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **WMT 2021 Evaluation Campaign**: This dataset is used for testing translation capabilities into and out of English for Chinese, French, and German. The authors note that they used news data from this campaign to minimize overlap with the training corpus of the PaLM model.

2. **WMT 2014 Evaluation Campaign**: Specifically mentioned for French translation, this dataset is older and serves as a comparison point for the authors.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution. 

For the **WMT datasets**, the citations are typically as follows:

- For **WMT 2021**:
  > Farhad Akhbardeh et al. (2021). *Findings of the 2021 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT21)*. In Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–88, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **WMT 2014**:
  > Philipp Koehn et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–12, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper attribution.
