To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diverse Inpainting and Editing with GAN Inversion" by Ahmet Burak Yildirim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they state that they utilized the **FFHQ human face dataset**, **AFHQ cat dataset**, and **AFHQ dog dataset**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the text. The authors mention that they used the **StyleGAN2 pre-trained models** and the train and validation splits of these datasets. However, they do not provide extensive details about the datasets themselves, so I will need to refer to the references section for full citations.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the complete citations for each dataset:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4401–4410, 2019.

2. **AFHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yunjey Choi, Youngjung Uh, Jaejun Yoo, and Jung-Woo Ha. *Stargan v2: Diverse image synthesis for multiple domains*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 8188–8197, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary information is included for each dataset.
