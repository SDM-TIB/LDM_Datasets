To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Detection of Left Ventricle in Arterial Input Function Images for Inline Perfusion Mapping using Deep Learning: A study of 15,000 Patients" by Hui Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a large dataset of scans, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of myocardial perfusion quantification and mention that a convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using a large data cohort. This hints at the presence of datasets but does not provide specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe the imaging and data collection process. Here, they mention that a total of **25,027 scans** from **12,984 patients** were assembled from three hospitals for training the CNN model. They also specify that a hold-out test set of **5,721 scans** from **2,805 patients** was used for evaluation. This gives me two key datasets to extract:

1. **Training Dataset**: 25,027 scans from 12,984 patients.
2. **Test Dataset**: 5,721 scans from 2,805 patients.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics but do not introduce any new datasets. Therefore, I will not find additional datasets here.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely internal datasets collected from the hospitals involved in the study. 

Since the datasets are not publicly available or cited in the references, I will note that the authors mention that the raw data supporting the findings are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This indicates that while the datasets are not formally published, they are accessible for further research.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted:

1. **Training Dataset**: 25,027 scans from 12,984 patients.
2. **Test Dataset**: 5,721 scans from 2,805 patients.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are internal datasets from the study and provide the authors' contact information for further inquiries.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
