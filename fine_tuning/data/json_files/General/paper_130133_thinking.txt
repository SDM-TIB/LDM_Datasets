To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SuperCLUE: A Comprehensive Chinese Large Language Model Benchmark" by Liang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper introduces a benchmark called SuperCLUE, which suggests that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (SuperCLUE Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **CArena**: This dataset consists of user-model interactions collected from the LangYa Leaderboard platform, where users can evaluate responses from different models. The authors state that they collected 9.9k queries with ratings from real users.

2. **OPEN Set**: This dataset includes open-ended questions designed to evaluate models' instruction-following abilities and multi-turn conversational capabilities. The authors mention that they collected a total of 600 questions for this dataset.

3. **CLOSE Set**: This dataset is derived from the OPEN Set and consists of closed-ended questions created by transforming open-ended questions into multiple-choice format. The authors explain the process of generating this dataset, which involves using GPT-3.5 to create questions and then manually verifying them.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors reference the following works related to the datasets:

- For **CArena**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, L., Chiang, W.-L., Sheng, Y., Zhuang, S., Wu, Z., Zhuang, Y., Lin, Z., Li, Z., Li, D., Xing, E. P., Zhang, H., Gonzalez, J. E., & Stoica, I. (2023). Judging LLM-as-a-judge with MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena. arXiv:2306.05685.

- For **OPEN Set**, the authors do not provide a specific citation, but it is part of the SuperCLUE benchmark they are introducing.

- For **CLOSE Set**, similar to the OPEN Set, it is part of the SuperCLUE benchmark and does not have a separate citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for CArena and note that OPEN and CLOSE Sets are part of the SuperCLUE benchmark without separate citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for any further processing or review.
