To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Feature Integration Network for Fine-grained Visual Classification" by Hui Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several fine-grained benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of fine-grained visual classification and the need for effective feature extraction methods. They hint at using datasets for evaluation but do not specify them yet.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset is published by the California Institute of Technology and contains 11,788 images of 200 bird categories, with a training set of 5,994 images and a test set of 5,794 images.

2. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset consists of 20,580 images from 120 subclasses, with 12,000 images for training and 8,580 for testing.

3. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset includes 16,185 images spanning 196 classes, split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 test images.

4. **FGVC-aircraft**: This dataset contains 10,000 images of 100 different aircraft types, divided into training and testing sets in a 2:1 ratio.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*.

- For **Stanford Dogs**, the citation is:

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 554â€“561.

- For **FGVC-aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-grained visual classification of aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
