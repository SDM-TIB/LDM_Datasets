To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust spectral clustering using LASSO regularization" by Camille Champion et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually describe the datasets used for validation and testing of their methods. In this section, I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors describe a collection of simulated datasets created to evaluate the performance of their proposed method. However, they do not provide a specific citation for these datasets since they are generated for the purpose of the study.

2. **FLORINASH Dataset**: This dataset is explicitly mentioned in the experiments section. It is associated with a project that studies the role of intestinal microfloral activity in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The authors provide details about the cohort and the type of data collected.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FLORINASH dataset. The paper cites the following source:

- For the **FLORINASH dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Hoyles. *Molecular phenomics and metagenomics of hepatic steatosis in non-diabetic obese women*. Nature Medicine, 24:1070â€“1080, 2018.

Since the simulated datasets do not have a formal citation, I will note that they are generated for the study and do not require a citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the FLORINASH dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
