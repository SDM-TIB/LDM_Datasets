To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PANTHER: Pathway Augmented Nonnegative Tensor factorization for HighER-order feature learning" by Yuan Luo and Chengsheng Mao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated PANTHER on "large scale Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and whole-genome genotyping datasets," which suggests that specific datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **Methods section**. The authors describe using the **Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)** dataset to filter mis-annotations of genetic variants. This is a clear dataset reference that I need to note.

In the **Experiments section**, I will focus on the two experiments described. The first experiment involves data from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, which includes subjects with various cancer types. The authors provide a breakdown of the dataset used for cancer type prediction, including the number of subjects and their distribution across training, validation, and test sets.

The second experiment focuses on hypertension and mentions a cohort of subjects enrolled in a multi-site study, but does not specify a dataset name. However, it does provide details about the subjects and their hypertension subtypes.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)**:
   > Lek, M., Karczewski, K. J., Minikel, E. V., Samocha, K. E., Banks, E., Fennell, T., O’Donnell-Luria, A. H., Ware, J. S., Hill, A. J., Cummings, B. B., et al. (2016). Analysis of protein-coding genetic variation in 60,706 humans. *Nature*, 536(7616), 285–291.

2. **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**:
   > Bertelsen, B., Tuxen, I. V., Yde, C. W., et al. (2019). High frequency of pathogenic germline variants within homologous recombination repair in patients with advanced cancer. *NPJ genomic medicine*, 4(1), 1–11.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
