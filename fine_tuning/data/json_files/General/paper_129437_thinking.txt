To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Alignment Is An Efficient Unified Model for Massive NLP Tasks" by Yuheng Zha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **5.9M examples from 28 datasets** for training their model, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Text Alignment Model)**, where the authors describe the training process and the datasets used. They mention adapting and aggregating **28 datasets** from various tasks, which is crucial information. I will look for a detailed list of these datasets in this section.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors evaluate their model on multiple datasets. I will carefully note down the datasets mentioned in the context of their experiments, particularly in subsections like **4.1 (Natural Language Understanding Tasks)** and **4.2 (Factual Consistency Evaluation)**. This will help me identify which datasets were used for which specific tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide context for each dataset's use in the research.

From my reading, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **SQuAD v2**: A dataset for question answering that includes unanswerable questions.
   - Citation: Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2018). *Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 784-789.

2. **MNLI**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset.

8. **TRUE**: A benchmark for factual consistency evaluation.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I format the dataset entries correctly and include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
