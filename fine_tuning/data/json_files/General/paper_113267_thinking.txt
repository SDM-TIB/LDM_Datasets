To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding and Improving Group Normalization" by Agus Gunawan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experimental results were demonstrated on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (specifically section 5) where the authors detail their methodology and results. In this section, they explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN** datasets for image classification tasks. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their research.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. In NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning 2011, 2011.

Since CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 share the same citation, I will ensure to note that in the dataset entries.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
