To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Heatmaps: Probabilistic Classification with Multiple Unreliable Information Sources" by Edwin Simpson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of unstructured data from various sources for situation assessment, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using crowdsourced annotations from different sources, including social media and satellite imagery. This indicates that there are datasets related to these sources, but I need to look for explicit mentions of dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe two real-world applications: one involving crowdsourced labels of satellite images and another involving text messages from the Haiti 2010 earthquake. I will look for specific datasets used in these experiments.

1. **Crowdsourced Labels of Satellite Images**: The authors mention using a dataset of 5,477 crowdsourced labels from the Planetary Response Network project. This dataset is used to classify grid squares based on whether they contain buildings with major damage.

2. **Haiti Earthquake Text Messages**: The authors refer to a dataset of 2,723 geo-tagged reports collected and labeled by Ushahidi after the Haiti earthquake. This dataset is used to predict binary class labels for emergencies.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Planetary Response Network dataset**, the citation is:
  > Planetary Response Network. *Planetary Response Network Project*. Available at: http://www.planetaryresponsenetwork.com/beta/.

- For the **Ushahidi dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ushahidi. *Ushahidi Haiti Project*. Available at: http://ushahidi.com/.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Dataset Name**: Crowdsourced Labels of Satellite Images
   - **Description**: A dataset of 5,477 crowdsourced labels marking features such as damaged buildings, blocked roads, and floods from satellite imagery.
   - **Citation**: Planetary Response Network. *Planetary Response Network Project*. Available at: http://www.planetaryresponsenetwork.com/beta/.

2. **Dataset Name**: Haiti Earthquake Text Messages
   - **Description**: A dataset of 2,723 geo-tagged reports collected and labeled by Ushahidi, categorizing situations reported after the Haiti earthquake.
   - **Citation**: Ushahidi. *Ushahidi Haiti Project*. Available at: http://ushahidi.com/.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
