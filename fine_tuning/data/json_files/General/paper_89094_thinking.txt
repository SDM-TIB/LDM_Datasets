To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evolutionary algorithms for constructing an ensemble of decision trees" by Evgeny Dolotov and Nikolai Zolotykh, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their methods using several public UCI datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using "several popular datasets from UCI repository" but do not list them immediately. I will look for any tables or figures that might enumerate these datasets.

In the text, the authors refer to various datasets in the context of their experiments, specifically in **Table 1** and **Table 2**. I will extract the dataset names from these tables, which include:

1. **car**
2. **tic-tac-toe**
3. **glass**
4. **iris**
5. **australian**
6. **wine**
7. **diabets**
8. **balance-scale**
9. **ionosphere**
10. **liver-disoder**
11. **dermatology**
12. **heart-statlog**
13. **page-blocks**
14. **cmc**
15. **vehicle**
16. **lympth**
17. **sonar**
18. **credit-g**
19. **haberman**

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. Since the datasets are from the UCI repository, I will look for a general citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository itself, which is often used as a reference for datasets sourced from there.

The citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository is:
> Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science. Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

With this citation, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the UCI repository citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and associated with the appropriate citation.
