To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "High Recall Data-to-text Generation with Progressive Edit" by ChoongHan Kim and Gary Geunbae Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **ToTTo dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is significant to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Implementation details)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ToTTo Dataset**: This dataset consists of Wikipedia tables paired with human-written descriptions. The authors specify that the training set includes 120,000 examples and the validation set has 7,700 examples.

2. **WIKITABLET**: This dataset combines Wikipedia table data with corresponding Wikipedia sections. It is noted that WIKITABLET has a training set of 100,000 samples and a validation set of 2,700 samples.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized both the **ToTTo** and **WIKITABLET** datasets for their experiments, which reinforces their importance in the study.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ToTTo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ankur P Parikh, Xuezhi Wang, Sebastian Gehrmann, Manaal Faruqui, Bhuwan Dhingra, Diyi Yang, and Dipanjan Das. *Totto: A controlled table-to-text generation dataset*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.14373, 2020.

- For the **WIKITABLET**, the citation is:
  > Mingda Chen, Sam Wiseman, and Kevin Gimpel. *Wikitablet: A large-scale data-to-text dataset for generating Wikipedia article sections*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14919, 2020.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
