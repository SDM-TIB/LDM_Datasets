To extract datasets from the research paper titled "U-Net: Machine Reading Comprehension with Unanswerable Questions" by Fu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on the **SQuAD 2.0 dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** of the paper, which is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this case, the authors explicitly mention the **SQuAD 2.0 dataset** and provide a brief description of it. They explain that SQuAD 2.0 combines answerable and unanswerable questions, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Rajpurkar, P., Jia, R., & Liang, P. (2018). Know What You Donâ€™t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD. ArXiv e-prints.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset:
1. **SQuAD 2.0 Dataset**: A dataset that includes over 100,000 questions on 500+ Wikipedia articles, combining answerable and unanswerable questions to challenge machine reading comprehension systems.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review, ensuring that it is clear and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.
