To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neighborhood-Enhanced Supervised Contrastive Learning for Collaborative Filtering" by Peijie Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their model was evaluated on **three real-world datasets: Yelp2018, Gowalla, and Amazon-Book**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) to gather more details about these datasets. In this section, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of users, items, ratings, and density. This information is essential for describing each dataset comprehensively.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Yelp2018**: Contains user-item interaction records with 31,688 users, 38,048 items, and 1,561,406 ratings, with a density of 0.130%.
2. **Gowalla**: Comprises 29,858 users, 40,981 items, and 1,027,370 ratings, with a density of 0.084%.
3. **Amazon-Book**: Includes 55,188 users, 9,912 items, and 1,445,622 ratings, with a density of 0.062%.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are commonly used datasets in the field of recommendation systems. However, I can provide general references for these datasets based on their common usage in research:

- **Yelp2018**: 
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge

- **Gowalla**: 
  > Gowalla Dataset. *Gowalla Dataset*. Available at: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html

- **Amazon-Book**: 
  > Amazon Product Review Dataset. *Amazon Product Review Dataset*. Available at: https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the relevant information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that each entry is clear and informative.
