To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EdgeNeXt: Efficiently Amalgamated CNN-Transformer Architecture for Mobile Vision Applications" by Muhammad Maaz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details that can help in describing them.

In **subsection 4.1**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset is used for classification experiments and contains approximately 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories.

2. **COCO**: This dataset is utilized for object detection tasks, providing around 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images.

3. **Pascal VOC 2012**: This dataset is employed for segmentation tasks and consists of nearly 10,000 images with semantic segmentation masks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to gather are:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252, 2015.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Pascal VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
