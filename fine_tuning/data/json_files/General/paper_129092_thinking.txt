To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FedET: A Communication-Efficient Federated Class-Incremental Learning Framework Based on Enhanced Transformer" by Chenghao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and mentions "benchmark datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically in the **NLP and CV sections**.

In **section 4.1 (Natural Language Processing)**, the authors list five text classification datasets:

1. **AGnews**: A news classification dataset with 4 classes, containing 10,000 training samples and 2,000 test samples.
2. **Yelp**: A sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes, containing 10,000 training samples and 2,500 test samples.
3. **Amazon**: Another sentiment analysis dataset with 5 classes, also containing 10,000 training samples and 2,500 test samples.
4. **DBpedia**: A dataset for Wikipedia article classification with 14 classes, containing 28,000 training samples and 7,000 test samples.
5. **Yahoo**: A Q&A classification dataset with 10 classes, containing 20,000 training samples and 5,000 test samples.

In **section 4.2 (Computer Vision)**, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **ImageNet-Subset**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset used for image classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 100 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **AGnews**, the citation is:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
