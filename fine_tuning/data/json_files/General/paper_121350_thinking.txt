To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Light-Weight Communication-Efficient Data Sharing Approach in 5G NR V2X" by Ran Wei and Lyutianyang Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) in V2X communication but does not explicitly mention any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **system model and simulation sections**. These sections often contain details about the data used for simulations or experiments. I will look for any references to datasets or data sources that the authors used to validate their proposed methods.

In the **simulation section**, the authors describe the use of a Monte Carlo simulator to analyze the performance of their proposed Ledger system. However, they do not specify any external datasets; instead, they seem to rely on theoretical models and simulations based on their proposed algorithms.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. The references may include foundational datasets or benchmarks that are commonly used in the field of V2X communication, but I need to confirm if any specific datasets are mentioned.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets that can be cited. Instead, they focus on theoretical constructs and simulations without referencing any publicly available datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have gathered their names, descriptions, and full citations from the references section.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that no specific datasets were provided in this paper, and thus, there are no citations to include.
