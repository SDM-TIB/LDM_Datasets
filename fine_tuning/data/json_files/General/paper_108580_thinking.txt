To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unleashing the Power of Transformer for Graphs" by Lingbing Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their experiments demonstrate superior performance on various tasks involving graphs, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in the paper. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. In this section, they mention several benchmarks for evaluation:

1. **PCQM4M-LSC**: This dataset is used for graph property prediction tasks. The authors note that it contains over 3.8 million 2D molecular graphs, which is significant for evaluating model performance in large-scale scenarios.

2. **ZINC**: Another dataset mentioned for graph property prediction, ZINC is described as a smaller dataset used to predict graph property regression for constrained solubility.

3. **Cora**: This dataset is used for node classification tasks and is a well-known citation network dataset.

4. **CiteSeer**: Similar to Cora, this dataset is also used for node classification and is another citation network.

5. **PubMed**: This dataset is mentioned as a citation network dataset used for transductive node classification.

6. **PPI**: This dataset is used for inductive evaluation and consists of protein-protein interaction graphs.

7. **FB15K-237**: This dataset is used for knowledge graph completion tasks and is a revised version of the original FB15K dataset.

8. **WN18RR**: Another dataset for knowledge graph completion, WN18RR is noted for being more sparse and having a variety of different entities.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Here are the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
