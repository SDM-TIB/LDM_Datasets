To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-convergence to global minimizers for Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization and constructions of local minimizers in the training of artificial neural networks" by Arnulf Jentzen and Adrian Riekert, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets, such as a section explicitly labeled **"Datasets"** or **"Experiments."** If such sections are not present, I will check the **methodology** or **experiments** sections for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets used for training or testing the artificial neural networks. I will note down the names of these datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they were used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using a dataset like the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the original citation, which is typically:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness for anyone reviewing the extracted datasets.
