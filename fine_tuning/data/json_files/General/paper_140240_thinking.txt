To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "An End-to-End Deep Learning Generative Framework for Refinable Shape Matching and Generation" by Soodeh Kalaie et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of synthetic data for In-Silico Clinical Trials (ISCTs) and may reference specific datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any mentions of datasets or sources of data.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly section IV, which is explicitly labeled as "DATASETS." This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, I will look for specific names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics about the datasets.

From section IV, I find two datasets mentioned:

1. **Left Ventricle (LV) Shapes**: This dataset consists of 1000 shapes extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images of the UK Biobank. The reference for this dataset is:
   > Petersen, S. E., Matthews, P. M., Francis, J. M., Robson, M. D., Zemrak, F., Boubertakh, R., Young, A. A., Hudson, S., Weale, P., Garratt, S., et al. (2015). "UK Biobankâ€™s cardiovascular magnetic resonance protocol." *Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance*, 18(1), 1-7.

2. **Liver Shapes**: This dataset includes 139 shapes from the public CT-ORG image dataset available from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The citation for this dataset is:
   > The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). "CT-ORG Image Dataset." [Online]. Available: https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct formatting for each citation and that they are complete.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
