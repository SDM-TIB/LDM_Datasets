To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Depth Growing for Neural Machine Translation" by Lijun Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their approach on two large-scale benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of increasing the depth of neural machine translation models and reference improvements in translation quality. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They state that they conduct experiments on two widely adopted benchmark datasets: **WMT14 English→German** and **WMT14 English→French**. This section provides the necessary details about the datasets, including the number of parallel sentence pairs used for training.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **WMT14 English→German**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. 2004. Statistical significance tests for machine translation evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2004 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing.

- For **WMT14 English→French**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn. 2004. Statistical significance tests for machine translation evaluation. In Proceedings of the 2004 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing.

Although both datasets are part of the WMT14 benchmark, they are typically referenced together in the context of machine translation tasks.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring that I include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
