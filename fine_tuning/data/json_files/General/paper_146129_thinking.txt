To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Trip Mode Choice Modeling Using Ensemble Synthesizer (ENSY)" by Amirhossein Parsi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of data augmentation techniques for mode choice datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)**: This dataset is derived from the London Travel Demand Survey (LTDS) and includes 81,086 trips made by 31,954 individuals over three years (April 2012 to March 2015).

2. **Korea Transport Database (KTDB)**: This dataset is based on the national household travel survey data collected in South Korea in 2016, encompassing data from 202,316 households.

In this section, the authors provide a brief overview of each dataset, including the number of trips and the time frame of data collection, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **London Passenger Mode Choice (LPMC)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Hillel, T., Elshafie, M.Z.E.B., & Jin, Y. (2018). Recreating passenger mode choice-sets for transport simulation: A case study of London, UK. *Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Smart Infrastructure and Construction*, 171, 29â€“42.

- For the **Korea Transport Database (KTDB)**, the citation is:
  > Korea Transport Database (KTDB). (2016). National transport surveys. Retrieved from https://www.ktdb.go.kr/eng/contents.do?key=263.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset, including their full citations, which are essential for proper referencing in any subsequent work.
