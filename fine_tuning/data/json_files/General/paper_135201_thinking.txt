To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Matrix Factorization for Interpretable Collaborative Filtering" by Kai Sugahara and Kazushi Okamoto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental setup section (Section 4)**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list four datasets: **ML-100K**, **ML-1M**, **Ciao**, and **DIGINETICA**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Next, I will look for the **dataset statistics** provided in Table 1, which includes user/item counts, interaction counts, and density for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scale and structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **ML-100K**:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The movielens datasets: History and context. ACM Trans. on Interact. Intell. Syst., 5.

2. **ML-1M**:
   > Harper, F. M., & Konstan, J. A. (2015). The movielens datasets: History and context. ACM Trans. on Interact. Intell. Syst., 5.

3. **Ciao**:
   > Tang, J., Gao, H., & Liu, H. (2012). Mtrust: Discerning multi-faceted trust in a connected world. In Proc. of the Fifth ACM Int. Conf. on Web Search and Data Min. (p. 93â€“102).

4. **DIGINETICA**:
   > DIGINETICA dataset. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
