To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Image Regression for Heterogeneous Change Detection" by Luigi T. Luppino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors performed experiments on **two real data sets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **methodology sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images, hinting at the need for diverse datasets. I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach and mention the use of **two different datasets** for testing their unsupervised change detection framework. I will carefully note the names and characteristics of these datasets as they are likely to be detailed here.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I will confirm the datasets used in the experiments. The authors typically provide insights into the performance of their methods on these datasets, which can help in understanding the context and significance of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Texas Forest Fire Dataset**: This dataset consists of a multispectral image acquired by Landsat 5 TM before a forest fire and an image acquired by EO-1 ALI after the event. The ground truth for this dataset is provided by Volpi et al. (2015).

2. **California Flood Dataset**: This dataset includes a Landsat 8 image and a Sentinel-1A image, with ground truth extracted from other single-polarisation SAR images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the guidelines provided in the paper. This will ensure that the extracted information is clear and useful for future reference or analysis.
