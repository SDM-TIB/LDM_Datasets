To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Sarcasm Detection Framework Using Context, Emotion and Sentiment Features" by Oxana Vitmana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the datasets section** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on four datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Description of Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed account of the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **SARC/movies**: This dataset is derived from the SARC corpus, which contains sarcastic comments from Reddit, specifically from the movies subreddit. The authors note the number of sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments in the dataset.

2. **SARC/technology**: Similar to the SARC/movies dataset, this dataset is also from the SARC corpus but focuses on the technology subreddit. It includes sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments as well.

3. **IAC V2**: This dataset is a subset of the Internet Argument Corpus, which is collected from online political debates. The authors specify that they used the largest subset that focuses on general sarcasm.

4. **Twitter**: This dataset consists of tweets that have been self-annotated with the #sarcasm hashtag. The authors mention that they used the English balanced version of this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **SARC**, the citation is:
  > Khodak, M., Saunshi, N., Vodrahalli, K. (2018). *A large self-annotated corpus for sarcasm*. In Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018). European Language Resources Association (ELRA), Miyazaki, Japan.

- For **Internet Argument Corpus (IAC)**, the citation is:
  > Abbott, R., Ecker, B., Anand, P., Walker, M. (2016). *Internet argument corpus 2.0: An SQL schema for dialogic social media and the corpora to go with it*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16). pp. 4445–4452.

- For **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ptáček, T., Habernal, I., Hong, J. (2014). *Sarcasm detection on Czech and English Twitter*. In Proceedings of COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers. pp. 213–223.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
