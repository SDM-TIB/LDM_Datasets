To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIREN-VAE: Leveraging Flows and Amortized Inference for Bayesian Networks" by Jacobie Mouton and Steve Kroon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the model's performance on "several synthetic datasets," which indicates that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. They state that they evaluate the performance of the SIReN-VAE on datasets generated from "three fully-specified Bayesian networks, obtained from the BN repository of Scutari (2022)." This suggests that the datasets are synthetic and based on Bayesian networks.

I will look for any specific names or identifiers for these datasets. The paper does not provide detailed names for the synthetic datasets, but it does reference the source of the Bayesian networks used to generate them. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are synthetic and derived from the Bayesian network repository.

In the **references section**, I will find the full citation for the source of the Bayesian networks:

- For the Bayesian network repository, the citation is:
  > Marco Scutari. *Bayesian network repository*. 2022. URL: https://www.bnlearn.com/bnrepository/.

Since the paper does not provide specific names for the synthetic datasets, I will summarize the information as follows:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The datasets used for evaluation are synthetic and generated from Bayesian networks.
   - Source: Bayesian network repository.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly identifies the datasets and their sources, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for future reference.
