To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SkeleTR: Towards Skeleton-based Action Recognition in the Wild" by Haodong Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its applications, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **Kinetics-400 (K400)**: This dataset contains videos with a variable number of people and is used as a benchmark for action classification. The authors note that some actions in K400 cannot be distinguished using only skeletons, leading them to use a subset called Posetics.

2. **Posetics**: This dataset merges classes featuring identical skeletons, resulting in 320 total classes. It is specifically mentioned as the main benchmark for action classification.

3. **NTU-Inter**: This dataset is a commonly used benchmark for two-person interaction recognition and is a subset of the NTURGB+D dataset.

4. **AVA 2.2**: This is a spatio-temporal action detection benchmark with 80 action classes, categorized into person movement, object manipulation, and person interaction.

5. **Volleyball**: This dataset is used for group activity recognition and includes clips with up to 13 persons, annotated with ground truth person boxes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Kinetics-400**, the citation is:

Ross, Carl Vondrick, Caroline Pantofaru, Yeqing Li, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, George Toderici, Susanna Ricco, Rahul Sukthankar, et al. *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
