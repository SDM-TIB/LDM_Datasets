To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Three iterations of (d âˆ’ 1)-WL test distinguish non-isometric clouds of d-dimensional points" by Valentino Delle Rose et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a concise overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** These sections usually detail the datasets used for experiments, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any mentions of datasets used for testing the WL test's effectiveness on point clouds. If the authors reference specific datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of points, dimensions, or any unique features.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper for full citations. This is crucial as it allows for proper attribution and provides readers with the means to access the datasets. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format as per the conventions used in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" and provide a citation, I will format it correctly. If the dataset is from a specific paper, I will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed to its source. This will facilitate easy reference for anyone reviewing the research or looking to utilize the datasets in their own work.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic integrity through correct citations.
