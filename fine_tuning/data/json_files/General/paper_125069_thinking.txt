To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stochastic Nonlinear Control via Finite-dimensional Spectral Dynamic Embedding" by Tongzheng Ren et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for empirical testing or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments or numerical studies. If the authors refer to benchmark problems or datasets, I will note their names and any specific details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "Pendulum" or "Cartpole," I will search for the original papers or sources that introduced these datasets to provide accurate citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as required. This will involve formatting the citations correctly and ensuring that all relevant details are included.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for downstream processing or review.
