To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UDAPTER - Efficient Domain Adaptation Using Adapters" by Bhavitvya Malik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used. The table lists two datasets: **MNLI** and **AMAZON**, along with their respective statistics for training, validation, and testing. This section is crucial as it provides both the names of the datasets and their usage in the experiments.

In the text following the table, the authors describe each dataset in more detail:

1. **MNLI (Multigenre Natural Language Inference)**: This dataset is described as containing hypothesis-premise pairs across various genres, with specific labels for each pair. The authors reference the original source of the dataset, which is essential for citation.

2. **AMAZON (Multi Domain Sentiment Analysis Dataset)**: This dataset consists of Amazon product reviews categorized into five different domains. The authors also mention the original source for this dataset, which is necessary for proper citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). A broad-coverage challenge corpus for sentence understanding through inference. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1112–1122, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **AMAZON**, the citation is:
  > Blitzer, J., Dredze, M., & Pereira, F. (2007). Biographies, Bollywood, boom-boxes and blenders: Domain adaptation for sentiment classification. In Proceedings of the 45th Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics, pages 440–447, Prague, Czech Republic. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or processing.
