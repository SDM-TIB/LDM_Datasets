To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hero-Gang Neural Model For Named Entity Recognition" by Jinpeng Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that their model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely utilized, but I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 3 (Experiments Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention six datasets: **WNUT17 (W17)**, **WNUT16 (W16)**, **OntoNotes 5.0 (ON5e)**, **BC5CDR-disease (BC5-D)**, **BC2GM**, and **BC5CDR-chem (BC5-C)**. Each dataset is described in terms of its application and characteristics.

I will also check **Table 1**, which summarizes the statistics of these datasets, including the number of sentences, entities, and average sentence lengths. This table provides additional context about the datasets.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
