To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Scale Control Signal-Aware Transformer for Motion Synthesis without Phase" by Lintao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on an existing biped locomotion dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved. I will take note of this and look for more details in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussions)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors are likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for the name of the dataset, its characteristics, and any relevant statistics mentioned.

In subsection 4.1, the authors refer to a public dataset used for their experiments, specifically mentioning that it consists of biped locomotion data collected using motion capture techniques. They note that the dataset includes various gaits, terrains, facing directions, and speeds, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

The authors also mention that the dataset was collected using a biped character with 31 joints and that it contains around 4 million samples for training. This information is essential for describing the dataset's size and complexity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset as being from Holden, Komura, and Saito (2017). I will locate this citation to ensure I have the complete reference.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Holden, D., Komura, T., & Saito, J. (2017). Phase-functioned neural networks for character control. *ACM Transactions on Graphics*, 36(4), 1-13.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Dataset Name**: Biped Locomotion Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of biped locomotion data collected using motion capture techniques, featuring various gaits, terrains, facing directions, and speeds.
   - **Size**: Approximately 4 million samples.
   - **Citation**: Holden, D., Komura, T., & Saito, J. (2017). Phase-functioned neural networks for character control. *ACM Transactions on Graphics*, 36(4), 1-13.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset details along with the full citation.
