To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSN: Learning Sparse Switchable Normalization via SparsestMax" by Wenqi Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors mention applying SSN to several benchmarks, including:

1. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 categories.
2. **Cityscapes**: A dataset for semantic urban scene understanding, which is commonly used in segmentation tasks.
3. **ADE20K**: Another dataset for semantic segmentation, which is widely used in the field.
4. **Kinetics**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, which includes a variety of human actions.

I will then look for specific details about each dataset, such as the number of samples, categories, and any unique characteristics mentioned in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations I will look for include:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

- For **Cityscapes**:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **ADE20K**:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene Parsing Through ADE20K Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

- For **Kinetics**:
  > J. Carreira and A. Zisserman. *Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017 IEEE Conference on, pages 4724–4733, 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
