To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "AdnFM: An Attentive DenseNet based Factorization Machine for Click-Through-Rate Prediction" by Kai Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that they conducted experiments on **two offline datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved but does not specify their names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset contains click logs from an online advertisement service collected over 7 days, comprising over 45 million samples with 13 integer features and 26 categorical features.

2. **MovieLens Dataset (20M)**: This dataset includes anonymous ratings for 27,278 movies from 128,493 users, with user ID, movie ID, and movie genres as raw features.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they evaluated their proposed method on these two datasets, which solidifies their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Criteo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge.

- For the **MovieLens Dataset**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 20M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Criteo Dataset**: A large dataset containing click logs from an online advertisement service, with over 45 million samples, featuring 13 integer and 26 categorical features.

2. **MovieLens Dataset (20M)**: A dataset containing anonymous ratings for 27,278 movies from 128,493 users, with features including user ID, movie ID, and movie genres.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation.
