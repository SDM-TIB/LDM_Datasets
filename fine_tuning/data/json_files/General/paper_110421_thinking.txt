To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CenterNet++ for Object Detection" by Kaiwen Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on the **MS-COCO dataset**, which is a well-known dataset in the field of object detection. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **MS-COCO dataset**. They describe it as containing 80 categories and over 1.5 million object instances, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's scale and complexity.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MS-COCO dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740â€“755, 2014.

Since the MS-COCO dataset is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is clear and complete, ready for any further processing or review.
