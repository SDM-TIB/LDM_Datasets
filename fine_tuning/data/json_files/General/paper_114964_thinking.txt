To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Domain Evaluation of a Deep Learning-Based Type Inference System" by Bernd Gruner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of **ManyTypes4Py** and introduces a new dataset called **CrossDomainTypes4Py**, which indicates that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will examine **section IV (CrossDomainTypes4Py)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. They describe **CrossDomainTypes4Py** as containing over 1,000,000 type annotations mined from GitHub and Libraries, specifically from the domains of web development and scientific calculation. This section confirms that this dataset is a significant contribution of the paper.

The authors also mention **ManyTypes4Py** as a benchmark dataset used in their experiments. They highlight its relevance and provide a citation for it, which I will need to include in my documentation.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **ManyTypes4Py**: The citation is:
   > Mir, A. M., Latoskinas, E., & Gousios, G. (2021). ManyTypes4Py: A benchmark Python dataset for machine learning-based type inference. In IEEE/ACM 18th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR), pp. 585â€“589. IEEE Computer Society. DOI: 10.1109/MSR52588.2021.00080.

2. **CrossDomainTypes4Py**: Since this dataset is introduced in the paper itself, I will cite it as follows:
   > Gruner, B., Sonnekalb, T., Heinze, T. S., & Brust, C.-A. (2023). Cross-Domain Evaluation of a Deep Learning-Based Type Inference System. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), pp. 1-12. DOI: 10.1109/MSR59073.2023.00034.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CrossDomainTypes4Py**: A dataset containing 7,912 repositories with over 1,000,000 type annotations, specifically from the domains of web development and scientific calculation.
- **ManyTypes4Py**: A benchmark dataset for type inference in Python, which is publicly available and widely used in related research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for future reference or processing.
