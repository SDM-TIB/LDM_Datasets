To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Adaptation for Dense Retrieval through Self-Supervision by Pseudo-Relevance Labeling" by Minghan Li and Eric Gaussier, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used. Here, they refer to the **MS MARCO** dataset as the source domain and list six target domain datasets from the **BEIR benchmark**. I will note these datasets and their descriptions:

1. **MS MARCO**: This dataset is used as the source domain for training the models. It is a well-known dataset for machine reading comprehension and passage ranking.

2. **FiQA**: A dataset for financial question answering, which contains queries and relevant documents related to finance.

3. **SciFact**: This dataset is focused on scientific fact-checking, containing claims and supporting documents.

4. **BioASQ**: A biomedical question answering dataset that includes questions and relevant biomedical literature.

5. **TREC-COVID**: A dataset consisting of biomedical papers related to COVID-19, used for information retrieval tasks.

6. **Touché-2020**: This dataset is for argument retrieval, focusing on the retrieval of argumentative texts.

7. **Robust04**: A dataset containing news documents, used for evaluating information retrieval systems.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
