To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Ablation Study of Self-Supervised Learning for Image Classification" by Ilias Papastratis, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on three image recognition datasets, which suggests that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the self-supervised training method and mentions that experiments will be conducted, but I need to look for specific dataset names in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test set has 10,000 images.

2. **STL-10**: This dataset is designed for unsupervised training and contains 100,000 unlabeled images, 5,000 labeled training images, and 8,000 test images. The images have a higher resolution of 96x96 compared to CIFAR-10.

3. **CelebA**: This dataset includes over 200,000 face images with various backgrounds and poses, focusing on a multi-label task for face attributes classification with 40 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), pages 215–223, 2011.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for any further processing or presentation.
