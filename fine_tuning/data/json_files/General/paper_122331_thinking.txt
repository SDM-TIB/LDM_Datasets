To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Metaphor Detection with Effective Context Denoising" by Shun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on several metaphor datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. They state that they conducted experiments on four public benchmark datasets: **VUA-18, VUA-20, MOH-X, and TroFi**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, as this will help in summarizing their characteristics.

1. **VUA-18**: This dataset was released in the metaphor detection shared task in 2018 and is one of the largest available datasets for this purpose.
2. **VUA-20**: An extension of VUA-18, this dataset includes approximately 12,000 sentences for the training set and 3,600 sentences for the test and validation sets.
3. **MOH-X**: Constructed by sampling sentences from WordNet, this dataset contains sentences with a single target verb annotated.
4. **TroFi**: This dataset consists of sentences from the Wall Street Journal Corpus, with an average sentence length of 28.3 tokens.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **VUA-18**, the citation is:
  > Chee Wee Leong, Beata Beigman Klebanov, and Ekaterina Shutova. *A report on the 2018 VUA metaphor detection shared task*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Figurative Language Processing, pages 56–66, 2018.

- For **VUA-20**, the citation is:
  > Chee Wee Leong, Beata Beigman Klebanov, Chris Hamill, Egon Stemle, Rutuja Ubale, and Xianyang Chen. *A report on the 2020 VUA and TOEFL metaphor detection shared task*. In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Figurative Language Processing, pages 18–29, 2020.

- For **MOH-X**, the citation is:
  > George A. Miller. *WordNet: An electronic lexical database*. MIT Press, 1998.

- For **TroFi**, the citation is:
  > Julia Birke and Anoop Sarkar. *A clustering approach for nearly unsupervised recognition of nonliteral language*. In 11th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2006.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
