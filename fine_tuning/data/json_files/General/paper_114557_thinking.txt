To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI-based Optimal Scheduling of Renewable AC Microgrids with Bidirectional LSTM-Based Wind Power Forecasting" by Hossein Mohammadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors utilized the **Australian Woolnorth wind site data** for evaluating their forecasting model, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look for more details about this dataset in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as containing one-hour instantaneous readings in megawatts (MW) from December 30, 2009, to January 1, 2010. This provides essential information about the dataset's temporal coverage and format.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that the Woolnorth wind site is particularly challenging for wind power forecasting due to its geographical location. This reinforces the significance of the dataset in their study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper cites the Woolnorth wind site data as follows:
> Mohammadi, H., Jokar, S., Mohammadi, M., Kavousifard, A., & Dabbaghjamanesh, M. (2022). AI-based Optimal Scheduling of Renewable AC Microgrids with Bidirectional LSTM-Based Wind Power Forecasting. *IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid*.

Since the dataset is derived from a specific site and not a standalone dataset publication, I will use the paper's citation as the authoritative reference for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will provide a clear and structured representation of the dataset used in the research.
