To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bespoke Nanoparticle Synthesis and Chemical Knowledge Discovery Via Autonomous Experimentations" by Hyuk Jun Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report on an autonomous experimentation platform for nanoparticle synthesis, which suggests that there may be datasets related to the synthesis conditions and resulting properties of the nanoparticles.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, where the authors describe their findings. They mention using a Bayesian optimizer to synthesize silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with specific optical properties, which implies that there are datasets related to the synthesis parameters (e.g., volumes of reagents) and the resulting optical properties (e.g., absorption spectra).

In the **methods section**, the authors detail the experimental setup and the parameters used for the synthesis of Ag NPs. They specify the reagents involved (AgNO3, H2O2, NaBH4, citrate, and H2O) and their respective volumes, which are crucial for constructing the dataset. They also mention the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy to characterize the optical properties of the synthesized nanoparticles, indicating that the absorption spectra data will be part of the dataset.

I will also check the **supplementary information** for any additional datasets or detailed experimental results. The supplementary figures and tables often contain raw data or summarized results that are essential for understanding the experiments conducted.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Synthesis Dataset**: This dataset includes the volumes of the reagents used for the synthesis of Ag NPs and the corresponding target optical properties (λmax, FWHM, and peak intensity). The authors provide specific volumes for each reagent and the resulting optical properties for different iterations of the experiments.

2. **Optical Properties Dataset**: This dataset consists of the absorption spectra obtained from the UV-Vis spectroscopy measurements. The authors compare their results with target spectra from the literature, which can be used to evaluate the performance of their synthesis method.

Next, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper:

- For the **synthesis of silver nanoparticles**, the relevant citation is:
  > Zhang, Q., Li, N., Goebl, J., Lu, Z., & Yin, Y. (2011). A systematic study of the synthesis of silver nanoplates: Is citrate a “magic” reagent? *Journal of the American Chemical Society*, 133(50), 18931-18939.

- For the **optical properties of silver nanoparticles**, the citation is:
  > Kelly, K. L., Coronado, E., Zhao, L. L., & Schatz, G. C. (2003). The optical properties of metal nanoparticles: The influence of size, shape, and dielectric environment. *Journal of Physical Chemistry B*, 107(3), 668-677.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
