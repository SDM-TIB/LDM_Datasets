To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enabling Grid-Aware Market Participation of Aggregate Flexible Resources" by Bai Cui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization formulations and validation on a realistic test feeder, which suggests that there may be datasets related to this test feeder.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical simulation results section** (Section IV), where the authors describe the data used for their simulations. Here, they mention using data from a real distribution feeder located in Southern California Edison, which is a key dataset.

In this section, the authors provide specific details about the distribution feeder, including the number of multiphase nodes, the types of distributed energy resources (DERs), and their configurations. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to previous works that may provide additional context or data sources.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **Southern California Edison Distribution Feeder Data**: This dataset includes detailed configurations and parameters of a distribution feeder with 126 multiphase nodes, 366 single-phase points of connection, and various DERs such as PV units, energy storage devices, and HVAC systems.

Now, I will look for the full citation for this dataset. The paper references a previous work for the detailed configurations and parameters of the distribution feeder, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Bernstein, A., & Dallâ€™Anese, E. (2019). Real-time feedback-based optimization of distribution grids: A unified approach. *IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems*, 6(3), 1197-1209.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper attribution. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.
