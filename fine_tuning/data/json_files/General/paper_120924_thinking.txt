To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time-Varying Coefficient DAR Model and Stability Measures for Stablecoin Prices: An Application to Tether" by Antoine Djogbenou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on Tether and its price dynamics, which suggests that historical price data may be utilized.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. The authors discuss the dynamics of Tether/USD rates and the need for historical data to analyze these dynamics. This indicates that there is likely a dataset related to Tether prices.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for specific details about the data used in the analysis. The authors mention that they analyze a sample of Tether's daily closing prices recorded between November 9, 2017, and July 31, 2021. This is a clear indication of a dataset that includes daily price data for Tether.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if the authors refer to any additional datasets or provide further context about the data used. They mention the analysis of Tether price dynamics and the application of the tvDAR model, which reinforces the focus on the Tether price dataset.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. The authors may reference the source of the Tether price data or any other relevant datasets.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. The key dataset identified is:

1. **Tether/USD Daily Closing Prices**: This dataset consists of daily closing prices for Tether against the US dollar, covering the period from November 9, 2017, to July 31, 2021.

The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, so I will note that it is derived from the authors' analysis of historical price data.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
