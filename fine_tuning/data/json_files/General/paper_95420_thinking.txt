To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph embedding using multi-layer adjacent point merging model" by Jianming Huang and Hiroyuki Kasai, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph-structured data in various fields, but I need to find explicit mentions of datasets. I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical evaluation section** where the authors present their experimental results. Here, they mention several widely used benchmark datasets, specifically:

1. **MUTAG**: This dataset includes graphs with discrete labels of both vertices and edges.
2. **Mutagenicity**: Similar to MUTAG, this dataset also contains graphs with discrete labels.
3. **BZR**: This dataset includes graphs with discrete and continuous vertex attributes.
4. **COX2**: Another dataset with discrete and continuous vertex attributes.
5. **PROTEINS**: This dataset contains graphs with discrete and continuous vertex attributes.

The authors note that all datasets are available in the TUD dataset repository, which is a crucial detail for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For **MUTAG**:
  > A. K. Debnath, R. L. Lopez de Compadre, G. Debnath, A. J. Shusterman, and C. Hansch. *Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds: correlation with molecular orbital energies and hydrophobicity*. Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 34(2):786–797, 1991.

- For **Mutagenicity**:
  > K. Riesen and H. Bunke. *IAM graph database repository for graph-based pattern recognition and machine learning*. In SPR and SSPR, 2008.

- For **BZR**:
  > J. J. Sutherland, L. A. O’Brien, and D. F. Weaver. *Spline-fitting with a genetic algorithm: A method for developing classification structure-activity relationships*. Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences, 43(6):1906–1915, 2003.

- For **COX2**:
  > K. M. Borgwardt, C. S. Ong, S. Schönauer, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, A. J. Smola, and H. P. Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(suppl 1):i47–i56, 2005.

- For **PROTEINS**:
  > K. M. Borgwardt, C. S. Ong, S. Schönauer, S. V. N. Vishwanathan, A. J. Smola, and H. P. Kriegel. *Protein function prediction via graph kernels*. Bioinformatics, 21(suppl 1):i47–i56, 2005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
