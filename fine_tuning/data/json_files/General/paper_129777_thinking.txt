To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CephGPT-4: An Interactive Multimodal Cephalometric Measurement and Diagnostic System with Visual Large Language Model" by Lei Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that a multimodal orthodontic medical dataset is constructed, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, particularly the subsection **3.1 (Dataset Construction)**, where the authors detail the datasets they created. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Medical Domain Question-Answering Dataset (MD-QA)**: This dataset consists of 59,642 doctor-patient dialogue records in both English and Chinese, covering topics related to orthodontic images, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations.

2. **Orthodontic Craniofacial Imaging and Measurement Multimodal Dataset (OCIMM Dataset)**: This dataset includes orthodontic medical images and corresponding textual diagnostic reports, collected from clinical case samples and annotated by professional doctors.

In the **data cleaning section**, the authors mention that they performed data cleaning on both the MD-QA and OCIMM datasets, which confirms their focus on these datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MD-QA dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it appears to be a newly constructed dataset by the authors. However, the OCIMM dataset references the Steiner analysis method, which is cited as follows:

- For the **Steiner analysis method**, the citation is:
  > C.C. Steiner, *Cephalometrics for you and me*, American Journal of Orthodontics, 39(10) (1953) 729-755.

Since the MD-QA dataset is original and does not have an external citation, I will note that it is a newly created dataset by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
