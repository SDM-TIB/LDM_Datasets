To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Risky Action Recognition in Lane Change Video Clips using Deep Spatiotemporal Networks with Segmentation Mask Transfer" by Ekim Yurtsever et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework for classifying dangerous lane change behavior and mentions a "semi-naturalistic lane change dataset with annotated risk labels." This suggests that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of lane change actions and the need for a dataset with risk labels. They mention that they utilized a "lane change dataset with manually annotated subjective risk labels," which implies that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section IV.A, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they used. They state that they used a subset of the NUDrive dataset, which consists of 860 lane change video clips captured by a front-facing camera. The section describes how the data was collected and annotated, confirming its relevance for their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the NUDrive dataset. The authors reference a paper that provides details about the dataset:

- For the **NUDrive dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kazuya Takeda, Jacob H. Hansen, P. Boyraz, L. Malta, Chiyomi Miyajima, and H. Abut. *International large-scale vehicle corpora for research on driver behavior on the road*. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 1609â€“1623, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
