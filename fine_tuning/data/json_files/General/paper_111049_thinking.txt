To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "On Generalisability of Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems" by Siamak Layeghy and Marius Portmann, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their models on **four recently published benchmark NIDS datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used in their study. They mention four datasets that have been converted into a common NetFlow-based format:

1. **NFv2-UNSW-NB15**: This dataset is derived from the original UNSW-NB15 dataset, which contains network traffic data for intrusion detection.

2. **NFv2-CIC-2018**: This dataset is based on the CICIDS 2018 dataset, which includes various types of network traffic for intrusion detection.

3. **NFv2-ToN-IoT**: This dataset is based on the ToN-IoT dataset, which focuses on IoT network traffic.

4. **NFv2-BoT-IoT**: This dataset is derived from the BoT-IoT dataset, which contains botnet traffic data for IoT environments.

The authors also mention that these datasets have been converted from their original formats into a common format with an identical feature set, which is crucial for their analysis.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **UNSW-NB15**, the citation is:

- For **CICIDS 2018**, the citation is:

- For **ToN-IoT**, the citation is:

  > N. Koroniotis, N. Moustafa, E. Sitnikova, and B. Turnbull. "Towards the development of realistic botnet dataset in the Internet of Things for network forensic analytics: Bot-IoT dataset." Future Generation Computer Systems, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the research findings.
