To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ODE Transformer: An Ordinary Differential Equation-Inspired Model for Neural Machine Translation" by Bei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the experiments were conducted on three WMT tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setups. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, they mention three widely-used benchmarks: 

1. **WMT’14 English-German (En-De)**: The training data consists of approximately 4.5 million tokenized sentence pairs.
2. **WMT’14 English-French (En-Fr)**: The training data consists of 36 million sentence pairs.
3. **WMT’16 English-Romanian (En-Ro)**: The training data consists of 600,000 sentence pairs.

The details provided in this section confirm the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The datasets are part of the WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) series, and the citations for these datasets are typically included in the proceedings of the respective workshops. However, the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, so I will refer to the general WMT references:

- For **WMT’14 English-German (En-De)**, the citation is:
  > M. Ott, S. Edunov, D. Grangier, and M. Auli. *Scaling Neural Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Third Conference on Machine Translation, Volume 1: Research Papers, pages 1–9, 2018.

- For **WMT’14 English-French (En-Fr)**, the citation is the same as above since it is part of the same workshop.

- For **WMT’16 English-Romanian (En-Ro)**, the citation is:
  > S. Mehta, M. Ghazvininejad, S. Iyer, L. Zettlemoyer, and H. Hajishirzi. *Delight: Very Deep and Light-weight Transformer*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.00623, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
