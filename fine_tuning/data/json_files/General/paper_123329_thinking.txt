To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multitask Prompt Tuning Enables Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning" by Zhen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on **23 NLP datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following source tasks with more than 100k annotations:

1. **MNLI** (Williams et al., 2017)
2. **QNLI** (Demszky et al., 2018)
3. **QQP** (Wang et al., 2018)
4. **SST-2** (Socher et al., 2013)
5. **SQuAD** (Rajpurkar et al., 2016)
6. **ReCoRD** (Zhang et al., 2018)

Additionally, the authors mention **23 datasets from four benchmarks** as target tasks, which include:

- From **SuperGLUE**:
  - **MultiRC** (Khashabi et al., 2018)
  - **BoolQ** (Clark et al., 2019a)
  - **WiC** (Pilehvar & Camacho-Collados, 2018)
  - **WSC** (Levesque et al., 2012)
  - **CB** (De Marneffe et al., 2019)

- From **GLUE**:
  - **RTE** (Giampiccolo et al., 2007)
  - **CoLA** (Warstadt et al., 2019)
  - **STS-B** (Cer et al., 2017)
  - **MRPC** (Dolan & Brockett, 2005)
  - **MNLI**, **QQP**, **QNLI**, and **SST-2** (already mentioned)

- From **MRQA**:
  - **Natural Questions** (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019)
  - **HotpotQA** (Yang et al., 2018)
  - **NewsQA** (Trischler et al., 2017)
  - **SearchQA** (Dunn et al., 2017)

- From the **Others** benchmark:
  - **WinoGrande** (Sakaguchi et al., 2021)
  - **Yelp-2** (Zhang et al., 2015)
  - **SciTail** (Khot et al., 2018)
  - **PAWS-Wiki** (Zhang et al., 2019)

- For NLG tasks:
  - **E2E** (Novikova et al., 2017)
  - **WebNLG** (Gardent et al., 2017)

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset.

After compiling the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its corresponding citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all information is accurate and complete.
