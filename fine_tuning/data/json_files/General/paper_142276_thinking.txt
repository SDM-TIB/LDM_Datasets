To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MixLight: Borrowing the Best of both Spherical Harmonics and Gaussian Models" by Xinlong Ji et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments demonstrate that MixLight surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on multiple metrics," which suggests that datasets are involved in these experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, I find that **section 4.1 (Dataset)** explicitly lists the datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **Laval Indoor HDR Dataset**: This dataset comprises 2100 HDR illumination maps, and the authors mention that they preprocess the data to create a total of 19,556 training pairs. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **Web Dataset**: This dataset is collected from the internet and contains 200 samples for testing. The authors emphasize that this dataset has no intersection with the Laval Indoor HDR Dataset, ensuring a fair evaluation of generalization performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Laval Indoor HDR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M.-A. Gardner, K. Sunkavalli, E. Yumer, X. Shen, E. Gambaretto, C. Gagné, and J.-F. Lalonde. *Learning to predict indoor illumination from a single image*. ACM Transactions on Graphics, vol. 36, no. 6, pp. 1–14, 2017.

- The **Web Dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is described as a collection of images gathered from the internet. Therefore, I will note it as a dataset without a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the experiments conducted by the authors.
