To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimum Description Length Recurrent Neural Networks" by Nur Lan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or experiments that involve specific datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges faced by neural networks but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will carefully read through the subsections of the experiments to identify any datasets mentioned.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe various tasks and their setups. They mention using training sets generated from a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) for the Dyck language tasks, but they do not provide specific dataset names or citations. However, they do mention the sizes of the training sets (e.g., 100 and 500 samples) and the nature of the data (e.g., sequences generated from a PCFG).

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the datasets are generated synthetically for the experiments. I will summarize the types of datasets used:

1. **Dyck-1 Language Dataset**: Generated from a PCFG with a probability of opening a new bracket. The dataset sizes are 100 and 500 samples.

2. **Dyck-2 Language Dataset**: Similar to Dyck-1 but requires a stack for recognition. The dataset is also generated from a PCFG with the same probability settings.

3. **Binary Addition Dataset**: This dataset consists of pairs of binary integers for testing the addition task, with sizes of 100 and 400 samples.

Since these datasets are not standard datasets with established citations, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the experiments in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the descriptions of the datasets and their generation methods, even though they lack formal citations. This will provide a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research.
