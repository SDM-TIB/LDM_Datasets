To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VST++: Efficient and Stronger Visual Saliency Transformer" by Nian Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model across various benchmark datasets for RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T salient object detection. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention several datasets for both RGB and RGB-D salient object detection:

1. **DUTS Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the largest available for salient object detection, containing 10,553 training images and 5,019 testing images.
   
2. **ECSSD Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,000 semantically meaningful images.

3. **HKU-IS Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,447 images with multiple foreground objects.

4. **PASCAL-S Dataset**: This dataset contains 850 images collected from the PASCAL VOC 2010 dataset.

5. **DUT-O Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,168 images.

6. **SOD Dataset**: This dataset contains 300 images.

For RGB-D salient object detection, the authors mention nine datasets:

1. **STERE Dataset**: The first stereoscopic saliency dataset, containing 1,000 images.

2. **NJUD Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,985 images collected from the Internet, 3D movies, and photographs.

3. **NLPR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 images.

4. **DUTLF-Depth Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,200 images.

5. **SIP Dataset**: This dataset includes 929 salient person images.

6. **LFSD Dataset**: This dataset contains 100 images.

7. **RGBD135 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 135 images.

8. **SSD Dataset**: This dataset contains 80 images.

9. **ReDWeb-S Dataset**: This dataset includes 3,179 images with diverse and challenging visual scenes and high-quality depth maps.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

For example, the citation for the DUTS dataset is:
> D. Wang, H. Lu, and X. Ruan. *Learning to detect salient objects with image-level supervision*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified with its respective citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
