To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Low Light Image Enhancement via SNR-Aware Swin Transformer" by Zhijian Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of low-light image enhancement and mention the need for datasets to evaluate their methods. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point, so I will continue to the methods and experimental sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention using the **LOL (Low-Light) dataset**, specifically referring to two versions: **LOLv1** and **LOLv2**. 

1. **LOLv1 Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset consists of 485 pairs of normal/low-light training data and 15 pairs of test data. They clarify that for their unsupervised learning approach, they only utilize the 485 low-light images for training.

2. **LOLv2 Dataset**: This dataset is divided into two parts: **LOLv2-real** and **LOLv2-synthetic**. The authors mention conducting experiments on the **LOLv2-real** dataset, which includes 689 pairs of normal/low-light training images and 100 pairs of test images. Similar to the LOLv1 dataset, they only use the low-light images for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **LOLv1 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guo, X., Li, Y., & Ling, H. (2016). LIME: Low-light image enhancement via illumination map estimation. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 26(2), 982-993.

- For the **LOLv2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yang, W., Wang, S., Fang, Y., Wang, Y., & Liu, J. (2020). From fidelity to perceptual quality: A semi-supervised approach for low-light image enhancement. In *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 3063-3072).

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This will facilitate further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
