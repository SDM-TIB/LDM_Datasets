To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking Popular Classification Models’ Robustness to Random and Targeted Corruptions" by Utkarsh Desai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors benchmark two popular text classification models against four datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention four datasets:

1. **SST2**: A two-class movie review dataset with single sentence reviews. The average size of the test set is 1,700 samples.

2. **IMDB**: A movie review dataset with longer reviews and a total of 25,000 samples.

3. **Yelp Reviews**: A dataset constructed from the Yelp Dataset Challenge, consisting of reviews rated either 1 (negative) or 5 (positive), with a total of 38,000 samples.

4. **DBPedia**: A dataset for category classification, with a test set size of 70,000 samples.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **SST2**, the citation is:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:
  > Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis*.

- For **Yelp Reviews**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset Challenge. *Yelp Dataset Challenge*. Available at: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge.

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:
  > Sören Auer, Christian Bizer, Georgi Kobilarov, Jens Lehmann, Richard Cyganiak, and Zachary Ives. *DBpedia: A nucleus for a web of open data*. In Proceedings of the 6th International The Semantic Web and 2Nd Asian Conference on Asian Semantic Web Conference, ISWC’07/ASWC’07, pages 722–735, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2007.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
