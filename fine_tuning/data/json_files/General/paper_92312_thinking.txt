To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Topology-aware Differential Privacy for Decentralized Image Classification" by Shangwei Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of datasets in the following sections:

1. **Section VII (Experiments)**: This section is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets used. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

2. **References section**: After identifying the datasets, I will check the references to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of handwritten digits. The citation for this dataset is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- **CIFAR10 Dataset**: Another popular dataset used for image classification, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The citation for this dataset is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 Datasets*. 2009.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly formatted before presenting it for review or further processing.
