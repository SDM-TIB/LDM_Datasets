To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Random Exploration in Bayesian Optimization: Order-Optimal Regret and Computational Efficiency" by Sudeep Salgia, Sattar Vakili, and Qing Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using benchmark functions for their empirical studies, specifically the **Branin**, **Hartmann-4D**, and **Hartmann-6D** functions. I will note these as datasets used for testing the proposed algorithm.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these benchmark functions. Since these functions are well-known in the optimization community, I will look for their original sources:

1. **Branin function**:
   > Azimi, J., Jalali, A., & Fern, X. Z. (2012). Hybrid batch bayesian optimization. In Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML, volume 2, pages 1215–1222.

2. **Hartmann-4D function**:
   > Picheny, V., Wagner, T., & Ginsbourger, D. (2013). A benchmark of kriging-based infill criteria for noisy optimization. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 48(3), 607–626.

3. **Hartmann-6D function**:
   > Picheny, V., Wagner, T., & Ginsbourger, D. (2013). A benchmark of kriging-based infill criteria for noisy optimization. Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization, 48(3), 607–626.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and properly referenced, ready for further processing or review.
