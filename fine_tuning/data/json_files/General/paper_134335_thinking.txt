To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-Set Face Recognition with Maximal Entropy and Objectosphere Loss" by Rafael Henrique Vareto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on three different datasets: **LFW**, **IJB-C**, and **UCCS**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction confirms that the experiments utilize LFW, IJB-C, and UCCS, emphasizing their relevance to open-set face recognition.

I will then look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In **Section 4.2**, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset contains 13,233 images of faces collected from the web, with a focus on unconstrained environments. It is primarily used for face verification tasks.

2. **IJB-C (IARPA Janus Benchmark C)**: This dataset includes images and videos of faces, designed for evaluating face recognition systems under open-set conditions. It contains a mix of known and unknown identities.

3. **UCCS (Uncontrolled College Students)**: This dataset consists of images captured in various conditions on a university campus, featuring both known subjects and numerous unknown faces.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **LFW**, the citation is:
  > Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Technical Report 07-49, Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, 2007.

- For **IJB-C**, the citation is:
  > Brianna Maze, Jocelyn Adams, James A. Duncan, Nathan Kalka, Tim Miller, Charles Otto, Anil K. Jain, W. Tyler Niggel, Janet Anderson, Jordan Cheney, and Patrick Grother. *IARPA Janus Benchmark - C: Face dataset and protocol*. In International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), 2018.

- For **UCCS**, the citation is:
  > Manuel Günther, Peiyun Hu, Christian Herrmann, Chi-Ho Chan, Min Jiang, Shufan Yang, Akshay Raj Dhamija, Deva Ramanan, Jürgen Beyerer, Josef Kittler, et al. *Unconstrained face detection and open-set face recognition challenge*. In International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB). IEEE, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
