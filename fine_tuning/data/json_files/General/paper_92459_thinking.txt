To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Memory Transformer" by Mikhail S. Burtsev et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of memory-augmented transformers on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for machine translation and language modeling tasks. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I find that the authors mention using the **WMT-14 DE-EN dataset** for machine translation tasks and the **WikiText-103 dataset** for language modeling tasks. This gives me the specific datasets I need to document.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **WMT-14 DE-EN dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ondrej Bojar, Christian Buck, Christian Federmann, Barry Haddow, Philipp Koehn, Johannes Leveling, Christof Monz, Pavel Pecina, Matt Post, Herve Saint-Amand, Radu Soricut, Lucia Specia, and Aleš Tamchyna. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pp. 12–58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, June 2014. Association for Computational Linguistics. URL http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W14/W14-3302.

2. For the **WikiText-103 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

In summary, I have identified two datasets used in the paper: the WMT-14 DE-EN dataset for machine translation and the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, along with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the research paper.
