To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MAGMA: Music Aligned Generative Motion Autodecoder" by Sohan Anisetty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **AIST++ Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,408 dance sequences performed by 30 dancers, paired with music from 10 genres. The sequences vary in length from 7 to 50 seconds, with an average length of 13 seconds.

2. **HumanML3D Dataset**: This dataset includes 14,616 human motion sequences at 20 FPS, along with 44,970 text descriptions. The authors mention that preprocessing steps applied to this dataset are also used on the AIST++ motions to create a combined dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **AIST++ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ruilong Li et al. "AI Choreographer: Music Conditioned 3D Dance Generation with AIST++." In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021.

- For the **HumanML3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chuan Guo et al. "Generating Diverse and Natural 3D Human Motions From Text." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
