To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fictional Worlds, Real Connections: Developing Community Storytelling Social Chatbots through LLMs" by Yuqian Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on storytelling social chatbots, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **background and implementation sections** for any references to datasets used in the study. In the background, the authors discuss the DE gaming community and the characters "David" and "Catherine," but I need to confirm if any datasets were collected or utilized for analysis.

In the **results and discussion sections**, the authors present findings based on community interactions and surveys. They mention collecting qualitative feedback through questionnaires (N=15) and interviews (N=8) with community members. This indicates that the authors gathered data from these interactions, which could be considered a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the paper primarily discusses the development and evaluation of social chatbots rather than traditional datasets, I will focus on the data collected during the study.

The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **Community Interaction Data**: This dataset includes the number of interactions with the chatbot "David" (31,278 interactions) and "Catherine" (20,767 interactions), as well as the number of active members participating in conversations.

2. **Survey Data**: This dataset consists of responses from 15 core community members who participated in questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the performance of the chatbots.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets:

- For the **Community Interaction Data**, since it is derived from the authors' own observations during the study, I will cite it as follows:
  > Sun, Y., Wang, H., Chan, P. M., Tabibi, M., Zhang, Y., Lu, H., Chen, Y., Lee, C. H., & Asadipour, A. (2023). *Fictional Worlds, Real Connections: Developing Community Storytelling Social Chatbots through LLMs*. In N. Pelechano, F. Liarokapis, D. Rohmer, & A. Asadipour (Eds.), Proceedings of the IMET - International Conference on Interactive Media, Smart Systems and Emerging Technologies.

- For the **Survey Data**, I will use the same citation as above since it is also part of the study conducted by the authors.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference in future analyses or discussions.
