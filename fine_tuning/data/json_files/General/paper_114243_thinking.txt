To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Users and Contemporary SERPs: A (Re-)Investigation: Examining User Interactions and Experiences" by Nirmal Roy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the main focus of the research, which can guide me to relevant sections.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the experimental setup, including any datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe a user study involving different SERP interfaces and participant interactions, but they do not mention any external datasets. Instead, they created their own SERP templates and curated results using APIs, which means the datasets are not traditional datasets but rather the results generated for the study.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets or data sources used in their analyses. However, it appears that the data collected is primarily from the user interactions during the study rather than from pre-existing datasets.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the data used in the study is derived from the authors' own experimental design and participant interactions rather than from established datasets. 

Finally, I will compile the information I have gathered, ensuring to include any relevant citations for the methodologies or tools used to create the datasets, even if they are not traditional datasets. In this case, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the data collection methodology.

The citation for the paper is:

ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3477495.3531719

In summary, while there are no traditional datasets to extract, I will document the methodology and the paper citation as the source of the data used in the study.
