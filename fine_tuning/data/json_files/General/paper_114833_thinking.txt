To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Signature-based validation of real-world economic scenarios" by Hervé Andrès et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's motivation and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly sections that detail the numerical analysis and applications. This section is likely to contain specific references to datasets used for validation and testing. For instance, the authors mention using historical data for various financial risk drivers, which suggests that there are datasets related to stock prices, volatility, and inflation.

In the **numerical results section**, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets used in the experiments. For example, the paper discusses the use of historical data from the S&P 500 and the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). I will note these datasets and their characteristics, such as the time period covered and the type of data (e.g., daily realized volatility, monthly inflation rates).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. For example, the paper cites the S&P 500 realized volatility data from Heber et al. (2009) and the CPI-U data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Here are the datasets I will extract:

1. **S&P 500 Realized Volatility Data**: 
   - Description: Daily realized estimates of the S&P 500 from January 2000 to January 2022.
   - Citation: Heber, G., Lunde, A., Shephard, N., & Sheppard, K. (2009). *Oxford-man institute’s realized library*. Version 0.1, Oxford & Man Institute, University of Oxford.

2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) Data**: 
   - Description: Monthly observations of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the United States from January 1950 to November 2022.
   - Citation: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (2023). *Consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, all items*. Retrieved from https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and easily accessible for future reference.
