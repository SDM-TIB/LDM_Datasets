To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Answering Comparative Questions: Better than Ten-Blue-Links?" by Matthias Schildwächter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the development of a system called CAM, which utilizes information from the Common Crawl. This suggests that the Common Crawl dataset is significant to the research, but I need to confirm its details and any other datasets mentioned.

Next, I will look through the **related work** section to see if the authors reference any datasets used in previous studies or comparisons. This section often provides context and may mention datasets that are relevant to the current research.

I will then focus on the **evaluation** section, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the experimental topics created for user studies. They mention that these topics were derived from comparative questions on platforms like Quora and other comparison pages. However, they do not specify any datasets in this section, so I will need to check if they are mentioned elsewhere.

In the **acknowledgments** section, the authors mention that their work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) within the project “Argumentation in Comparative Question Answering (ACQuA)”. This indicates that there may be datasets associated with this project, but I will need to look for specific references.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned throughout the paper. The most prominent dataset mentioned is the **Common Crawl**, which is a web-scale dataset that the CAM system utilizes.

The citation for the Common Crawl dataset is:
> Common Crawl. *Common Crawl: A Non-Profit Organization that crawls the web and freely provides its archives and datasets to the public*. Available at: https://commoncrawl.org/

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
