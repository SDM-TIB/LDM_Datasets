To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lightweight Graph Convolutional Networks with Topologically Consistent Magnitude Pruning" by Hichem Sahbi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **FPHA dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the author states: "Experiments conducted on the challenging FPHA dataset show the substantial gain of our topologically consistent pruning method." This confirms that the FPHA dataset is used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FPHA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **FPHA Dataset**: 
  > G. Garcia-Hernando, S. Yuan, S. Baek, and T.-K. Kim. *First-Person Hand Action Benchmark with RGB-D Videos and 3D Hand Pose Annotations*. In CVPR, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the dataset name, description, and the full citation, ready for further processing or review.
