To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Betti numbers of attention graphs is all you really need" by Laida Kushnareva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on three text classification benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA)**: This dataset contains 10,657 sentences labeled for grammatical acceptability, with a public part of 9,594 sentences divided into training and development sets, and a hidden test set of 1,063 sentences.

2. **Large Movie Review Dataset v1.0 (IMDB)**: This dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled by sentiment (positive or negative). The authors mention that they applied a length restriction to keep reviews under 128 tokens, resulting in 5,505 reviews for their experiments.

3. **SMS Spam Collection v.1 (SPAM)**: This dataset contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as either legitimate (ham) or spam. The authors divided this dataset into training, development, and test sets in an 80:10:10 ratio.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CoLA**, the citation is:
  > Warstadt, A., Singh, A., & Bowman, S. R. (2018). Neural Network Acceptability Judgments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471.

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:

- For **SPAM**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
