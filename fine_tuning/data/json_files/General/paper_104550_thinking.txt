To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Language Learning for Product Matching" by Ralph Peeters and Christian Bizer, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper explores matching product offers from different e-shops, which suggests that datasets related to product offers are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe the datasets as containing English- and German-language offers for mobile phones, collected from 66 different e-shops. They mention that each offer includes a title, description, and product identifiers, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's structure.

The authors also explain the process of creating pairs of offers based on shared identifiers and how they structured the training sets. They specify the sizes of the training sets, which range from 450 to 7200 pairs, and mention a German-language test set containing 1200 pairs. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors cite a previous work related to the dataset creation process, which is essential for providing a full citation. The relevant citation is:

- For the dataset related to product matching:

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **English and German Mobile Phone Offers Dataset**: This dataset consists of offers for mobile phones collected from 66 different e-shops, containing titles, descriptions, and product identifiers. The dataset is structured into pairs for training purposes.

2. **German Language Test Set**: A specific test set containing 1200 pairs of offers, with a distribution of 25% matches and 75% non-matches, used to evaluate the performance of the models.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation for clarity and proper attribution. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
