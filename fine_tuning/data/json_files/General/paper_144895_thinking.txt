To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mathematical Topics Tree Benchmark for Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs" by Arash Gholami Davoodi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract introduces the **Mathematical Topics Tree (MaTT)** benchmark, which suggests that this is a dataset created for evaluating LLMs on mathematical reasoning.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the research. In this case, the **Methods** or **Datasets** section is likely to provide comprehensive information. I will focus on the section where the authors describe the creation of the MaTT benchmark, as this will likely contain details about the dataset itself.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the MaTT benchmark consists of **1,958 questions** across **12 distinct mathematical topics**. They also describe how they structured the dataset using reference books and Wikipedia topics, but they do not mention any external datasets used for evaluation.

Since the MaTT benchmark is the primary dataset discussed, I will gather the necessary details about it. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the MaTT benchmark itself, but it does mention the reference books used to create the dataset. I will compile these references as they are essential for understanding the sources of the dataset.

The reference books mentioned in the paper include:

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the MaTT benchmark, ensuring to include the relevant citations for the reference books used to create it. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset and its sources, which is crucial for anyone looking to understand or utilize the MaTT benchmark in their research.
