To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correlating Edge, Pose with Parsing" by Ziwei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method reports new state-of-the-art accuracy on three human parsing datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **LIP (Look Into Person)**: This dataset is described as a large-scale benchmark focusing on semantic understanding of human body parts and clothing labels. It contains 50,462 images, with annotations for 20 semantic human parts and 16 body keypoints.

2. **ATR (Attribute Recognition)**: This dataset includes 16,000 training images and is used for human part labeling across 18 categories, including various clothing items and accessories.

3. **CIHP (Cityscapes Human Parsing)**: This dataset consists of 38,280 images with 20 categories, providing a comprehensive set of annotations for human parsing tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **LIP**:

- For **ATR**:

  > Ke Gong, Xiaodan Liang, Yicheng Li, Yimin Chen, Ming Yang, and Liang Lin. *Instance-level human parsing via part grouping network*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 770–785, 2018.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
