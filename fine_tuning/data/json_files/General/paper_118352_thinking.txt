To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent via Non-blocking Mini-batches" by Haoze He and Parijat Dube, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on a "suite of datasets and deep learning networks," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved, but it does not specify their names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for evaluating their proposed Non-blocking SGD algorithm. This is a crucial finding as it provides the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will gather more details about these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are well-known benchmarks in the field of machine learning, particularly for image classification tasks. I will confirm their characteristics and ensure I have the correct citations for them.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for the datasets. The citations for the CIFAR datasets are typically attributed to the original authors who introduced them. The relevant citations are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

Both datasets are part of the same work, so they share the same citation.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
