To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving ICD coding using Chapter based Named Entities and Attentional Models" by Abhijith R. Beeravolu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **MIMIC-III** dataset, which is a significant indicator that I should focus on this dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **Methods section**. Here, the authors describe the **MIMIC-III** dataset in detail, stating that it consists of health-related information associated with distinct hospital admissions. They mention two major tables used: **Diagnosis_ICD** and **Noteevents**. 

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset includes 58,976 unique hospital admissions (HADM_IDs) with an average of 11 ICD codes per admission. The authors explain how they merged the **Diagnosis_ICD** and **Noteevents** datasets to create 52,726 discharge summaries for their experiments.

In the **Results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using the MIMIC-III dataset, which further confirms its significance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MIMIC-III dataset. The citation is as follows:

- **MIMIC-III Dataset**: 
  > Pollard, T.J. and Johnson, A.E.W. (2016). The MIMIC-III Clinical Database. 

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for MIMIC-III, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
