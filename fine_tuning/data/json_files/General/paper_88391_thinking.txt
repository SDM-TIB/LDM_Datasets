To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Spectral Bias of the Deep Image Prior" by Prithvijit Chakrabarty and Subhransu Maji, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the deep image prior and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **introduction** and **experiments** sections for more details.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the deep image prior and its implications for denoising images, but again, no specific datasets are named. I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are more likely to be mentioned.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for testing or validation. The authors mention that they used images from a "standard dataset" for their experiments, but they do not specify the name of the dataset in this section. However, they do provide a link to a dataset in the references.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper refers to a dataset used in previous works, specifically citing the following:

- The dataset used for the denoising experiments is referenced as:
  > "http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/index.html"

This URL points to the "GCF-BM3D" dataset, which is commonly used for image denoising tasks.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **GCF-BM3D Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of denoising algorithms. It includes a variety of images that are commonly used in the image processing community.

Finally, I will ensure to write down the full citation for the dataset as it appears in the references, which is essential for proper attribution.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

In conclusion, I will prepare the dataset entry for the GCF-BM3D dataset, ensuring it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
