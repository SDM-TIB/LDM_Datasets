To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global SNR Estimation of Speech Signals Using Entropy and Uncertainty Estimates from Dropout Networks" by Rohith Aralikatti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the DNN-HMM model is trained on the **GRID corpus** and tested on noise profiles from the **DEMAND noise database**. This suggests that these two datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors mention that the DNN-HMM based ASR system is trained on the **GRID corpus**, which consists of 34 speakers and 1000 utterances per speaker. This provides a clear description of the dataset used for training.

Additionally, the authors state that they experimented with 16 different noise types from the **DEMAND noise dataset**. This dataset is used to add noise to the test set of utterances, which is essential for evaluating the SNR estimation methods.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **GRID corpus**, the citation is:
   > Martin Cooke, Jon Barker, Stuart Cunningham, and Xu Shao. *An audio-visual corpus for speech perception and automatic speech recognition*. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, vol. 120, no. 5, pp. 2421â€“2424, 2006.

2. For the **DEMAND noise database**, the citation is:
   > J. Thiemann, N. Ito, and E. Vincent. *DEMAND: Diverse environments multichannel acoustic noise database*. 2013.

With these citations, I now have the necessary information to describe each dataset accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all information is clear and ready for further processing or review.
