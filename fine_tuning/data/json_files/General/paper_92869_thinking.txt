To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Re-Identification by Multiple Views Knowledge Distillation" by Angelo Porrello et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors discuss performance on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **MARS Dataset**: This dataset comprises 19,680 tracklets from 6 different cameras, capturing 1,260 different identities. It is noted for its challenging nature due to automatic annotation errors.

2. **Duke-Video-ReID Dataset**: This dataset includes 5,534 video tracklets from 8 different cameras, with 414 identities. The authors specify that identities have been manually annotated from tracking information.

3. **VeRi-776 Dataset**: Collected from 20 fixed cameras, this dataset contains 18,397 tracklets with an average of 6 frames per tracklet, capturing 775 identities.

4. **Amur Tiger Re-Identification in the Wild (ATRW)**: This dataset includes 107 subjects with an average of 17.6 images per identity, focusing on animal re-identification.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MARS Dataset**:

- For **Duke-Video-ReID Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
