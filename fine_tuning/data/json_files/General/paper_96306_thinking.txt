To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving P300 Speller performance by means of optimization and machine learning" by Luigi Bianchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Numerical Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention five different datasets:

1. **AMUSE Dataset**: This dataset is based on auditory stimuli elicited by spatially located speakers, performed on healthy subjects. The dataset is downloadable from the BNCI horizon website.

2. **P300 Speller Dataset**: This dataset is the classical P300 Speller protocol, performed on 10 healthy subjects.

3. **ALS P300 Speller Dataset**: This dataset is also based on the classical P300 Speller protocol but is performed on 8 patients suffering from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

4. **MVEP Dataset**: This dataset involves a visual protocol where a moving pattern generates a movement-onset visual evoked potential, used to recognize the user’s choice. It includes 16 healthy subjects.

5. **Center Speller Dataset**: This dataset is a visual protocol with three different stimuli, two levels, and 10 rounds, performed on 13 healthy subjects.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **AMUSE Dataset**: 
  > Martijn Schreuder, Thomas Rost, and Michael Tangermann. *Listen, you are writing! Frontiers in Neuroscience*, 5:112, 2011.

- **P300 Speller Dataset**:

- **ALS P300 Speller Dataset**: 
  > Angela Riccio, Luca Simione, Francesca Schettini, Alessia Pizzimenti, Maurizio Inghilleri, Marta Olivetti Belardinelli, Donatella Mattia, and Febo Cincotti. *Attention and P300-based BCI performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis*. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 7:732, 2013.

- **MVEP Dataset**: 
  > Sulamith Schaeff, Matthias Sebastian Treder, Bastian Venthur, and Benjamin Blankertz. *Exploring motion VEPs for gaze-independent communication*. Journal of Neural Engineering, 9(4):045006, 2012.

  > Matthias Sebastian Treder, Nico Maurice Schmidt, and Benjamin Blankertz. *Gaze-independent brain–computer interfaces based on covert attention and feature attention*. Journal of Neural Engineering, 8(6):066003, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
