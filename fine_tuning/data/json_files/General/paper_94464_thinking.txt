To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MCW-Net: Single Image Deraining with Multi-level Connections and Wide Regional Non-local Blocks" by Yeachan Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world rainy datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention five synthetic datasets and three real-world datasets:

1. **Rain200H**: A synthetic dataset with 1,800 training images and 200 testing images.
2. **Rain200L**: Another synthetic dataset with 1,800 training images and 200 testing images.
3. **Rain800**: A synthetic dataset with 700 training images and 100 testing images.
4. **Rain1200**: A synthetic dataset with 12,000 training images and 1,200 testing images.
5. **RainCityscapes**: A synthetic dataset with 9,432 training images and 1,188 testing images.
6. **SPA-Data**: A real-world dataset with 640,000 training images and 1,000 testing images.
7. **Yang et al.**: A real-world dataset with 15 training images and 206 testing images.
8. **DQA**: A real-world dataset with 58 training images and 249 testing images.
9. **Raindrop**: A real-world dataset with 861 training images.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used these datasets for their evaluations, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
