To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Energy-based Detection and Classification of Multilingual Text Lines" by Igor Milevskiy and Yuri Boykov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a "large new database of multilingual text images collected in the public transit system of Seoul," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further emphasizes the challenges of multilingual text detection and hints at the existence of a dataset used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention that they have a database of 500 images taken from the Seoul subway, which they plan to make publicly available. This is a crucial piece of information, as it directly pertains to the dataset used in their experiments.

I will then check the **conclusion** and **references** sections to gather more details about the dataset. The conclusion reiterates the availability of the database, but I need to ensure I have the correct citation for it. Since the paper does not provide a specific reference for the dataset, I will note that the authors plan to make it publicly available, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation unless they reference it in future work.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **Multilingual Text Image Database**: This dataset consists of 500 images collected from the public transit system of Seoul. It is designed for evaluating multilingual text detection algorithms.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is forthcoming and will be made publicly available by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset's name, description, and the authors' intent to make it publicly available.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
- Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
- Look for dedicated sections discussing datasets or experiments.
- Confirm the dataset's details and note the lack of a formal citation.
- Prepare to present the dataset information clearly and accurately.
