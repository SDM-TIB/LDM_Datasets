To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Novel Deep Learning Framework for Bovine Iris Segmentation" by Heemoon Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the study utilizes the **BovineAAEyes80 public dataset** for iris segmentation, which is a clear indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction section** to gather more context about the dataset. The authors mention that they will develop multiple segmentation models by training on publicly available bovine iris datasets, specifically highlighting **BovineAAEyes80** again. This reinforces its importance in the study.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any additional details about the dataset, such as its structure, size, and how it was used in the experiments. The authors describe the dataset as containing pairs of images and annotation data, which is crucial for understanding its application in the study.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any mentions of the dataset's performance metrics or any comparisons made using it. However, since the primary focus is on the BovineAAEyes80 dataset, I will ensure to note its significance in the results.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the BovineAAEyes80 dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset's repository, which is essential for proper citation. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, source, and publication year.

The citation for the BovineAAEyes80 dataset is:
> J. I. Larregui, D. Cazzato, and S. M. Castro. *An image processing pipeline to segment iris for unconstrained cow identification system*. Open Computer Science, vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 145-159, 2019. Available at: https://github.com/juanilarregui/BovineAAEyes80

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured format for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented and can be referenced in future research or applications.
