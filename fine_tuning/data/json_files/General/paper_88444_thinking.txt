To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Heart Failure Readmission from Clinical Notes Using Deep Learning" by Xiong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained CNNs using discharge summary notes from the **MIMIC III database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset.

Next, I will look closely at the **Materials and Methods section**, specifically where the authors describe the MIMIC III database. They mention that it is a freely available database covering over 58,000 hospital admissions of more than 46,000 patients from 2001 to 2012. This section confirms that MIMIC III is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

In the **Experiments section**, the authors state that they created two datasets: one for general readmission and another for 30-day readmission. They provide statistics about these datasets, including the number of admissions and the number of admissions followed by readmissions. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the MIMIC III database from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> A. E. Johnson et al. MIMIC-III a freely accessible critical care database. *Sci. Data*, vol. 3, 2016.

The paper does not provide separate citations for the two datasets created for general and 30-day readmission, as they are derived from the MIMIC III database. Therefore, I will only include the citation for MIMIC III.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:
1. **MIMIC III Database**: A comprehensive database of patients admitted to the ICU, containing clinical and billing data, including discharge summaries.

I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the MIMIC III dataset.
