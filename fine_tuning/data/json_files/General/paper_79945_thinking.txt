To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Distributed ADMM for Large-Scale Optimization - Part I: Algorithm and Convergence Analysis" by Tsung-Hui Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Results," or "Applications."** In these sections, authors usually describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including details like the number of samples, features, and any relevant characteristics.

While reading through the paper, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets used for testing their algorithms, I will record their names and any descriptions provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "LASSO problem dataset," I will find the original source or paper that introduced this dataset and note its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
