To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach" by Yinhan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they collected a large new dataset called **CC-NEWS** to control for training set size effects. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (Section 3.2) where the authors describe the datasets used for pretraining. They mention several datasets:

1. **BOOKCORPUS**: This dataset is used in the original BERT training and consists of 16GB of uncompressed text.
2. **CC-NEWS**: A dataset collected from the English portion of the CommonCrawl News dataset, containing 76GB of English news articles.
3. **OPENWEBTEXT**: An open-source recreation of the WebText corpus, which is 38GB in size.
4. **STORIES**: A dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data, filtered to match a story-like style, totaling 31GB.

In addition to these datasets, the authors also mention that they used **GLUE**, **SQuAD**, and **RACE** for evaluation purposes. These are benchmarks rather than datasets used for training, but they are important to note for completeness.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **BOOKCORPUS**, the citation is:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In *Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)*.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
