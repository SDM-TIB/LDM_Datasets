To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCOVID-Fuse: A Multi-modality Deep Learning Model Fusing Chest X-Radiographs and Clinical Variables to Predict COVID-19 Risk Levels" by Yunan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves a model trained on clinical variables and chest X-rays (CXRs), which suggests that there are datasets related to these modalities.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, where the authors describe the data collection process. They mention that the initial CXRs and clinical variables were collected from 2085 patients from the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System between February 2020 and April 2020. This gives me a clear indication of the dataset used for training and validation.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide details about the patient cohorts used for training (1657 patients), validation (428 patients), and testing (439 patients). This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and size.

Now, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **References section** to obtain full citations. The paper does not mention any publicly available datasets but refers to the data collected from the Northwestern Memorial Health Care System. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is proprietary and not publicly available.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **Northwestern Memorial Health Care System COVID-19 Dataset**: This dataset includes clinical variables and chest X-ray images from 2085 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The dataset is used to train the DeepCOVID-Fuse model and is not publicly available.

Since there are no specific citations for publicly available datasets, I will summarize the dataset information without a formal citation but will note the proprietary nature of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
