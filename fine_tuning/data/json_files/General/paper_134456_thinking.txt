To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Neural Text Detectors" by Vitalii Fishchuk and Daniel Braun, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on adversarial attacks on neural text detectors, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the methods and results sections.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Approaches)**, where the authors describe the methods used in their experiments. They mention using texts generated by the GPT-3.5-turbo model via the OpenAI API, but they do not refer to a specific dataset for training or evaluation. Instead, they describe the generation of texts based on prompts and parameters, which suggests that the dataset is not a traditional dataset but rather a collection of generated texts.

In **section 4 (Results)**, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their approaches but again do not mention any specific datasets. They focus on the performance of different neural text detectors (GPT-2 Output detector, OpenAI classifier, and Turnitin AI detector) rather than datasets. 

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets in the traditional sense (like image or text datasets), I will check the **References section** for any related works that might have datasets associated with them. However, the references primarily cite other research papers and tools rather than specific datasets.

The only potential dataset-like reference is the list of essay topics from Nova (2019), which is used as a basis for generating texts. I will extract this reference as it could be considered a source for the prompts used in the experiments.

The citation for this reference is:
> Nova, A. (2019). *Essay topics: 100+ best essay topics*. Retrieved from https://www.5staressays.com/blog/essay-writing-guide/essay-topics. Last accessed: 2023-07-11.

Since the paper does not provide any other datasets, I will summarize my findings. The only relevant entry is the essay topics reference, which I will format according to the required citation style.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing.
