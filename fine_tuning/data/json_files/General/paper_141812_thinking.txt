To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Exploring the Potential of Large Foundation Models for Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection" by Ting Lei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets, **SWIG-HOI** and **HICO-DET**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They mention that the **SWIG-HOI dataset** encompasses 400 human actions and 1000 object categories, with approximately 14,000 images and 5,500 interactions in the test set. They also note that around 1,800 interactions are not present in the training set. For the **HICO-DET dataset**, they describe it as providing 600 combinations involving 117 human actions and 80 objects, and they simulate a zero-shot detection setting by holding out 120 rare interactions.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **SWIG-HOI dataset**, the citation is:
   > Suchen Wang, Kim-Hui Yap, Henghui Ding, Jiyan Wu, Jun-song Yuan, and Yap-Peng Tan. *Discovering human interactions with large-vocabulary objects via query and multi-scale detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 13475–13484, 2021.

2. For the **HICO-DET dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yu-Wei Chao, Yunfan Liu, Xieyang Liu, Huayi Zeng, and Jia Deng. *Learning to detect human-object interactions*. In 2018 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), pages 381–389. IEEE, 2018.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations for each dataset.
