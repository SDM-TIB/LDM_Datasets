To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HAL3D: Hierarchical Active Learning for Fine-Grained 3D Part Labeling" by Fenggen Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using **PartNet** and **Amazon-Berkeley Objects (ABO)**, which are likely the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors detail the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **Stanford PartNet**: This dataset is used for fine-grained shape analysis and is organized into categories such as chairs, tables, lamps, and storage furniture. The authors mention filtering out noisy shapes and using 500 shapes from each category, which confirms its relevance.

2. **Amazon-Berkeley Objects (ABO)**: This dataset consists of approximately 8,000 high-quality 3D shapes created by artists. The authors explain that they decompose these shapes into convex components for labeling, which indicates its application in their study.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **PartNet**, the citation is:
  > Kaichun Mo, Shilin Zhu, Angel X. Chang, Li Yi, Subarna Tripathi, Leonidas J. Guibas, and Hao Su. *PartNet: A large-scale benchmark for fine-grained and hierarchical part-level 3D object understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2019.

- For **Amazon-Berkeley Objects (ABO)**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned in the context of the dataset description. If the authors have not provided a formal citation, I will note that it is a dataset of high-quality 3D shapes created by artists.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the research.
