To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Federated Variational Inference: Towards Improved Personalization and Generalization" by Elahe Vedadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on **FEMNIST** and **CIFAR-100**, which indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention that they evaluate their model on **FEMNIST**, which is a dataset for digit and character classification, and **CIFAR-100**, which is a dataset for image classification with 100 classes. 

In the **implementation section**, the authors provide additional context about how these datasets are used in their experiments. They mention that **FEMNIST** is particularly relevant due to its diverse data-generating distributions for each client, while **CIFAR-100** is synthetically partitioned among clients.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **FEMNIST**: The citation is:
   > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečný, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. (2019). Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.01046*.

2. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. *Technical Report*.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **FEMNIST**: A dataset for digit and character classification, which includes a variety of writing styles from different clients.
- **CIFAR-100**: A dataset for image classification containing 100 classes, with data synthetically partitioned for federated learning scenarios.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for further processing or review.
