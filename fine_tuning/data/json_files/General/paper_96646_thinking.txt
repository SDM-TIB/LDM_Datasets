To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Classification via Categorical Memory Networks" by Weijian Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving competitive accuracy on four benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction further emphasizes the challenges of fine-grained classification and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets in the **experiments section**. They mention four datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset contains 200 bird categories with approximately 30 training images per category, totaling 5,994 training images and 5,794 testing images.

2. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset consists of 196 categories of cars, with 8,144 training examples and 8,041 testing examples.

3. **FGVC Aircraft**: This dataset includes 10,000 images across 100 categories, with a training/testing ratio of approximately 2:1.

4. **NABirds**: This is a large-scale dataset with 555 classes, comprising 23,929 training images and 24,633 testing images.

To ensure accuracy, I will cross-reference these datasets with the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 Dataset*.

- For **Stanford Cars**, the citation is:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops.

- For **FGVC Aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Maji, S., Rahtu, E., Kannala, J., Blaschko, M., & Vedaldi, A. (2013). *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1306.5151.

- For **NABirds**, the citation is:
  > Van Horn, G., Branson, S., Farrell, R., Haber, S., Barry, J., Ipeirotis, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2015). *Building a Bird Recognition App and Large Scale Dataset with Citizen Scientists: The Fine Print in Fine-Grained Dataset Collection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
