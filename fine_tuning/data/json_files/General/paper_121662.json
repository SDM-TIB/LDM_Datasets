The images were taken at 16 spectral channels (500-650 nm) and 40× magnification power. The samples were evaluated by 2 highly experienced independent pathologists and labeled into four classes: 128 cases of stroma, 128 cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia, 128 cases of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and 128 cases of prostatic carcinoma.",
