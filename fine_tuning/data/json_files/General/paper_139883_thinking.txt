To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-efficient Event Camera Pre-training via Disentangled Masked Modeling" by Zhenpeng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the challenges of lacking sufficient labeled data for event cameras, which suggests that datasets are crucial to the research. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned here.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss their experimental setup. In this section, they mention the datasets used for pre-training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any dataset names and descriptions provided.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors specify the datasets they utilized:
1. **N-Caltech101**: This dataset is recorded using an event camera and consists of 8,246 samples, each lasting 300 ms, covering 101 object categories. This dataset is highlighted as being more suitable for their tasks compared to others due to its robust representation of motion cues.

2. **CIFAR-10-DVS**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for fine-tuning, but the authors do not provide extensive details about it in this section.

Additionally, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **N-Caltech101**, the citation is:
  > Garrick Orchard, Ajinkya Jayawant, Gregory Cohen, and Nitish V. Thakor. *Converting static image datasets to spiking neuromorphic datasets using saccades*. CoRR, abs/1507.07629, 2015.

- For **CIFAR-10-DVS**, the citation is:
  > Arnon Amir, Brian Taba, David Berg, Timothy Melano, Jeffrey McKinstry, Carmelo Di Nolfo, Tapan Nayak, Alexander Andreopoulos, Guillaume Garreau, Marcela Mendoza, et al. *A low power, fully event-based gesture recognition system*. In CVPR, pages 7243â€“7252, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
