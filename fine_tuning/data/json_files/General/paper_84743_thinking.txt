To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Noisy-As-Clean: Learning Self-supervised Denoising from the Corrupted Image" by Jun Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed "Noisy-As-Clean" (NAC) strategy and mentions experiments on synthetic and realistic noise removal, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific references to datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments on various benchmarks. They mention using the **Set12 dataset** and the **BSD68 dataset** for evaluating their denoising methods. I will note down the details provided about these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics (PSNR and SSIM) for their methods on these datasets, which confirms their use. They also mention the **Cross-Channel (CC) dataset** and the **DND dataset** for testing on real-world images. I will ensure to capture these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Set12 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly referenced in image denoising literature, but the paper does not provide a specific citation. I will note that it is a widely used benchmark dataset for image denoising.

2. **BSD68 Dataset**: Similar to the Set12 dataset, this is also a well-known dataset in the field. Again, the paper does not provide a specific citation, but I will acknowledge its common usage.

3. **Cross-Channel (CC) Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > A. Abdelhamed, S. Lin, and M. S. Brown. "A high-quality denoising dataset for smartphone cameras." In CVPR, June 2018.

4. **DND Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > T. Pl√∂tz and S. Roth. "Benchmarking denoising algorithms with real photographs." In CVPR, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
