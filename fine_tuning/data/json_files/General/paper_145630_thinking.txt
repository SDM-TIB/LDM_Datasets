To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoder–Decoder Neural Networks in Interpretation of X-ray Spectra" by Jalmari Passilahti et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, which can help identify them.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of machine learning models to analyze X-ray spectra and refer to datasets derived from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed in the methods section.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. Here, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **H2O Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 snapshots from AIMD trajectories for the H2O molecule, along with respective O K-edge X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), X-ray emission spectra (XES), and X-ray absorption spectra (XAS). The dataset is openly available and referenced in the paper.

2. **Amorphous GeO2 Dataset**: This dataset includes 13,896 structures and their corresponding Ge Kβ X-ray emission spectra (XES) simulated at various pressures. The authors provide details about the simulation conditions and the nature of the data.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models using these datasets, which confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

- For the **H2O Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Niskanen, A. Vladyka, J. Niemi, C. J. Sahle. *Emulator-based decomposition for structural sensitivity of core-level spectra*. Royal Society Open Science 9 (6) (2022) 220093. doi:10.1098/rsos.220093.

- For the **Amorphous GeO2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Vladyka, C. J. Sahle, J. Niskanen. *Towards structural reconstruction from X-ray spectra*. Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 25 (9) (2023) 6707–6713. doi:10.1039/d2cp05420e.

With this information gathered, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing of the datasets used in the study.
