To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks" by Pengju Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed MWCNN is effective for tasks such as image denoising, single image super-resolution (SISR), JPEG image artifacts removal, and object classification. This indicates that datasets related to these tasks may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **DIV2K dataset** for training their MWCNN model. They specify that DIV2K contains 800 images with about 2K resolution for training, 100 images for validation, and 100 images for testing.

The authors also mention several datasets used for specific tasks:
1. For **image denoising**, they evaluate their method on:
   - **Set12**: A dataset commonly used for image denoising.
   - **BSD68**: Another well-known dataset for benchmarking denoising algorithms.
   - **Urban100**: A dataset that includes urban scenes for denoising evaluation.

2. For **single image super-resolution (SISR)**, they use:
   - **Set5**: A standard dataset for evaluating super-resolution methods.
   - **Set14**: Another dataset commonly used for super-resolution tasks.
   - **BSD100**: A dataset that is also used for super-resolution evaluation.
   - **Urban100**: Reused from the denoising task.

3. For **JPEG image artifacts removal**, the authors mention:
   - **Classic5**: A dataset used for evaluating JPEG artifact removal methods.
   - **LIVE1**: Another dataset used for assessing image quality and restoration methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will include:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
