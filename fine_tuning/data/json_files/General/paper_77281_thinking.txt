To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration" by Yihan Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of graph embedding and mention that they performed extensive experiments. However, they do not specify any datasets here either. Therefore, I will move on to the **experimental section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 3 (The Importance of Norm Regularization)**, the authors describe their experimental setup and mention three datasets used for their experiments: **Tweet**, **BlogCatalog**, and **YouTube**. I will extract the details provided for each dataset:

1. **Tweet Dataset**: This dataset is an undirected graph that encodes keyword co-occurrence relationships using Twitter data. It consists of approximately 1.1 million English tweets collected in August 2014, with 9,913 nodes and 681,188 edges.

2. **BlogCatalog Dataset**: This dataset contains social relationships between BlogCatalog users, consisting of 10,312 nodes and 333,983 undirected edges. Each node belongs to one of 39 groups.

3. **YouTube Dataset**: This dataset represents a social network among YouTube users, including 500,000 nodes and 3,319,221 undirected edges.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **BlogCatalog Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zafarani, R., & Liu, H. (2009). Social computing data repository at ASU. Retrieved from http://socialcomputing.asu.edu.

- For the **YouTube Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mislove, A., Marcon, M., Gummadi, K. P., Druschel, P., & Bhattacharjee, B. (2007). Measurement and Analysis of Online Social Networks. In Proceedings of the 5th ACM/Usenix Internet Measurement Conference (IMCâ€™07), San Diego, CA, October 2007.

The **Tweet Dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, but it is described in detail in the appendix.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
