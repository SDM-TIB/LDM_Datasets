To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning from Observer Gaze: Zero-Shot Attention Prediction Oriented by Human-Object Interaction Recognition" by Yuchen Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of a novel gaze fixation dataset named **Interactive Gaze (IG)**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is being introduced. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset, stating that it comprises 530,000 fixation points across 740 diverse interaction categories.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the dataset is described in **section 2 (Interactive Gaze (IG) Dataset)**. Here, the authors provide comprehensive details about the dataset, including the number of interaction scenarios, categories, and fixation points. 

The key details I need to extract include:
1. **Dataset Name**: Interactive Gaze (IG)
2. **Description**: A large-scale interaction-centric gaze fixation dataset capturing human cognitive processes during interactions, consisting of 530,000 fixation points from 32 human observers across 740 interaction categories, 80 object categories, and 132 action categories.
3. **Source of Data**: The interaction scenes are selected from HOI benchmark datasets, specifically **HICO-det** and **VCOCO**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets used in this research are as follows:

- For **Interactive Gaze (IG)**, since it is a novel dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite it as:
  > Yuchen Zhou, Linkai Liu, Chao Gou. *Learning from Observer Gaze: Zero-Shot Attention Prediction Oriented by Human-Object Interaction Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2023.

- For **HICO-det**, the citation is:
  > Yu-Wei Chao, Yunfan Liu, Xieyang Liu, Huayi Zeng, and Jia Deng. *Learning to detect human-object interactions*. In WACV, pages 381â€“389. IEEE, 2018.

- For **VCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Saurabh Gupta and Jitendra Malik. *Visual semantic role labeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.04474, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
