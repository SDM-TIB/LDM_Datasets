To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wav-BERT: Cooperative Acoustic and Linguistic Representation Learning for Low-Resource Speech Recognition" by Guolin Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two datasets:

1. **IARPA BABEL Dataset**: This is described as an open-source multilingual corpus of conversational telephone speech. The authors specify that they use data from three languages: Swahili, Tamil, and Vietnamese. 

2. **AISHELL-1 Dataset**: This is identified as an open-source and high-quality Mandarin speech corpus, widely used in the speech community.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IARPA BABEL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark JF Gales, Kate M Knill, Anton Ragni, and Shakti P Rath. *Speech recognition and keyword spotting for low-resource languages: Babel project research at cued*. In Fourth International Workshop on Spoken Language Technologies for Under-Resourced Languages (SLTU-2014), pages 16–23, International Speech Communication Association (ISCA), 2014.

- For the **AISHELL-1 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hui Bu, Jiayu Du, Xingyu Na, Bengu Wu, and Hao Zheng. *AISHELL-1: An open-source mandarin speech corpus and a speech recognition baseline*. In 2017 20th Conference of the Oriental Chapter of the International Coordinating Committee on Speech Databases and Speech I/O Systems and Assessment (O-COCOSDA), pages 1–5, IEEE, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the structured output for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
