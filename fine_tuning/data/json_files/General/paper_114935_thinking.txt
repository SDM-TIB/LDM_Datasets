To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIET: Conditional independence testing with marginal dependence measures of residual information" by Mukund Sudarshan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for validation or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section often includes information about the nature of the datasets, their sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets in their experiments. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, such as:

1. **Synthetic datasets**: The authors describe synthetic datasets created for testing their method. I will note the characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of samples and the variables involved.

2. **Real-world datasets**: The paper references real datasets, particularly in the context of the semi-synthetic genetics experiment and electronic health records. I will extract the names and details of these datasets, including their sources and any relevant citations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like the RNA expression data from Yang et al. (2012), I will ensure to include the full citation:

- Yang, W., Soares, P., Greninger, P., Edelman, E. J., Lightfoot, H., Forbes, S., Bindal, N., Beare, J., Smith, J. A., Thompson, I. R., et al. (2012). Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer (GDSC): a resource for therapeutic biomarker discovery in cancer cells. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 41(D1), D955â€“D961.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
