To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dependable Intrusion Detection System for IoT: A Deep Transfer Learning-based Approach" by Sk. Tanzir Mehedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for dependable intrusion detection systems (IDS) in IoT environments, which suggests that they likely utilized specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that may have introduced relevant datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Model Implementation and Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset has been generated from various heterogeneous sources, including seven IoT sensors. The specific sensors mentioned are:

1. **Fridge Sensor**: Measures temperature conditions.
2. **GPS Tracker Sensor**: Determines geographic position.
3. **Motion Light Sensor**: Includes motion and light status.
4. **Garage Door Sensor**: Observes door state and phone signal.
5. **Modbus Sensor**: Facilitates communication between devices.
6. **Thermostat Sensor**: Regulates temperature.
7. **Weather Sensors**: Produce air temperature, pressure, and humidity data.

The authors also mention that the combined dataset has 22 features, including a label feature indicating normal and attack scenarios.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors describe the process of cleaning and integrating the dataset, which indicates that they have likely created a new dataset from existing sources. They refer to a specific dataset called the **TON_IoT_Telemetry_Dataset**, which is mentioned as suitable for data-driven IDS.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citation for the **TON_IoT_Telemetry_Dataset** is:

- Alsaedi, A., Tari, Z., Mahmud, R., Moustafa, N., Mahmood, A. N., & Anwar, A. (2020). *TON_IoT Telemetry Dataset: A New Generation Dataset of IoT and IIoT for Data-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems*. IEEE Access, 8, 165130â€“165150.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
