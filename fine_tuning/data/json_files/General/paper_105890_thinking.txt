To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stress field prediction in fiber-reinforced composite materials using a deep learning approach" by Anindya Bhaduri et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of finite element method (FEM) simulations and mention that they are using data from a series of FEM models. This suggests that the datasets are derived from these simulations, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (Methodology)**, particularly the subsection titled "Problem setup." Here, the authors describe the input and output data used for training the deep learning model. They mention that the input images are binary maps representing the location of fibers and the matrix, and the output is the corresponding von Mises stress field. However, they do not provide specific dataset names or citations.

In **section 3 (Results)**, the authors discuss the accuracy of their predictions based on different configurations (6-fiber, 10-fiber, 20-fiber, and 100-fiber composite systems). They mention that data from 25 FEM simulations are considered for each system, which indicates that the datasets are generated from these simulations but still lack formal citations.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will refer to the **References section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily discuss methodologies and previous works rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the paper, it appears that the datasets used are not formally named or cited, as they are derived from FEM simulations conducted by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are based on the authors' own simulations rather than established datasets with formal citations.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Dataset from FEM simulations**: The authors generated datasets from a series of finite element method simulations of fiber-reinforced composite materials, specifically for configurations of 6, 10, 20, and 100 fibers. However, no formal dataset names or citations are provided in the paper.

Since there are no specific datasets with citations, I will document this finding clearly, indicating that the datasets are original to the authors' research and not publicly available or previously published datasets.
