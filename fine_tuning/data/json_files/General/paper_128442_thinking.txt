To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Minimizing Energy Consumption in MU-MIMO via Antenna Muting by Neural Networks with Asymmetric Loss" by Nuwanthika Rajapaksha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the context of their research and mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets used for training or testing the neural network. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets, such as their size, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

I will also examine the **results section** to see if the authors discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets. They may provide metrics or comparisons that reference the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "3GPP compliant system-level simulator" or any other specific dataset, I will ensure to find the original source or citation for it.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy review or further processing, making sure to include all relevant details as per the requirements.
