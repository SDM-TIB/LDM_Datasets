To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean Shift for Self-Supervised Learning" by Soroush Abbasi Koohpayegani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method achieves results on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention several datasets for transfer learning tasks, including:

1. **Food101**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating the model's performance on food classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 10 classes.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes.
4. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition, containing 397 categories.
5. **Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of car models.
6. **Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft types.
7. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture classification.
8. **Pets**: A dataset for classifying different breeds of pets.
9. **Caltech-101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
10. **Flowers**: A dataset for classifying different types of flowers.

I will then check the **appendix** for additional details about these datasets, such as the number of classes, training samples, validation samples, and the evaluation metrics used.

After gathering the necessary information, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will include:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
