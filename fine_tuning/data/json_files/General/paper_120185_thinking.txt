To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Punctuation Restoration for Singaporean Spoken Languages: English, Malay, and Mandarin" by Abhinav Rao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on English and Mandarin IWSLT2022 datasets and a Malay News dataset. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Data and Data Preprocessing)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **IWSLT2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for both English and Mandarin. It consists of transcribed TED talks for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Speech-Language Translation (SLT), and Machine Translation (MT). The authors specify that they used the EN-FR parallel tracks for English and the ZH-EN parallel tracks for Mandarin.

2. **Malay News Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as being composed of 30,000 news articles crawled from Google News, specifically targeting articles written in Malay. They also mention that this dataset was normalized to ensure it was well-formed.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they utilized the IWSLT2012 datasets for English and Mandarin, and the Malay News dataset for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their research.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IWSLT2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > 2012 International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, IWSLT 2012, Hong Kong, December 6-7, 2012. Available: http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/iwslt_12/

- For the **Malay News Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Husein, "Malay-dataset," GitHub repository, 2018. Available: https://github.com/huseinzol05/malay-dataset

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
