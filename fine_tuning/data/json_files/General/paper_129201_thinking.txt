To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spectral Batch Normalization: Normalization in the Frequency Domain" by Rinor Cakaj et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for evaluating their proposed method. I will focus on sections that describe the experiments, as they typically detail the datasets used, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention using the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, **TinyImageNet**, and **ImageNet** datasets. I will extract the relevant details about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 32x32 pixels, across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it has 100 classes.
3. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset contains 100,000 images of 200 classes, with each class having 500 training images and 50 validation images, resized to 64x64 pixels.
4. **ImageNet**: The ILSVRC 2012 dataset includes 1.2 million training images, 50,000 validation images, and 150,000 test images, labeled with 1,000 categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." Master's thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

- **TinyImageNet**:
  > Le, Y., & Yang, X. S. (2015). "Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge."

- **ImageNet**:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. S. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211â€“252, 2015. DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
