To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hierarchical Transfer Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification" by Xishuang Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted using **CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the importance of large datasets for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They specifically mention **ImageNet** and **YouTube-BoundingBoxes** as examples of big datasets that are beneficial for training models. This suggests that these datasets may be relevant to their work.

In the **experiments section**, I will find detailed descriptions of how the authors utilized the datasets. They explicitly state that they performed experiments on **CIFAR-10**, which consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, and **ImageNet**, which is a large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks. The paper provides specific details about the structure and distribution of the CIFAR-10 dataset, confirming its use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a single structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
