To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Controllable Colorization via Imagination" by Xiaoyan Cong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets were used. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will move to the **experiments section** (Section 4). This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention two datasets in Section 4.1 (Experimental Setting):

1. **COCO-stuff**: This dataset is referenced as containing 5,000 images in the validation set. It is known for its diverse set of object categories and is commonly used for image segmentation and colorization tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: The authors refer to the ImageNet testing split, which consists of 10,000 images. ImageNet is a well-known dataset used for various computer vision tasks, including classification and colorization.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **COCO-stuff**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Jasper Uijlings, and Vittorio Ferrari. *Coco-stuff: Thing and stuff classes in context*. 2018.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
