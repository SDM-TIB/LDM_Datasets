To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Investigation of How Label Smoothing Affects Generalization" by Blair Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets used in the study.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments conducted on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments** or **datasets**. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on datasets like **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. I will note these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them in the text.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they manipulated the datasets and the clean rates used for testing label smoothing. They specifically mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** for their experiments, which confirms their use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
