To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Mixed-Precision Quantization Search of BERT" by Changsheng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of pre-trained language models like BERT and mentions the need for model compression techniques, but it does not specify any datasets. The introduction provides context about BERT and its limitations but again does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experimental Evaluation)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their proposed AQ-BERT method on four NLP tasks: **SST-2**, **MNLI**, **CoNLL-2003**, and **SQuAD**. This indicates that these tasks are associated with specific datasets.

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets within the text. The authors mention that they evaluate their method on the following datasets:

1. **SST-2**: This dataset is used for sentiment classification tasks.
2. **MNLI**: The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference dataset is used for natural language inference tasks.
3. **CoNLL-2003**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition tasks.
4. **SQuAD**: The Stanford Question Answering Dataset is used for question answering tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SST-2**, the citation is:
  > Socher, J., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642.

- For **MNLI**, the citation is:
  > Williams, A., Nangia, N., & Bowman, S. (2018). *A Broad-Coverage Challenge Corpus for Sentence Understanding through Inference*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-HLT), pages 1112–1122.

- For **CoNLL-2003**, the citation is:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL), pages 142–147.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 238–244.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
