To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Path sampling of recurrent neural networks by incorporating known physics" by Sun-Ting Tsai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in experiments. In this section, the authors discuss their methodology and provide examples of the datasets they applied their approach to. I will look for any specific names or descriptions of datasets, particularly in the context of the examples they provide.

In the **methodology section**, the authors may describe the datasets used for training their models. I will pay attention to any references to datasets related to molecular dynamics simulations or quantum systems, as these are key areas of focus in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset from a specific study, I will locate that study in the references and extract the full citation. This may involve looking for papers that describe the datasets in detail, especially if they are foundational datasets in the field of molecular dynamics or quantum simulations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly organized and ready for presentation or further analysis, maintaining a focus on clarity and accuracy in the documentation of each dataset.
