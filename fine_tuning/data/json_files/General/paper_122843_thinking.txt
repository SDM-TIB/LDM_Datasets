To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Amortised Invariance Learning for Contrastive Self-Supervision" by Ruchika Chavhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "two different modalities: vision and audio," which suggests that datasets related to these modalities may be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)** and any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In section 4.1, the authors describe their experiments and mention the datasets used for pre-training and downstream tasks.

I will identify the datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **ImageNet**: The authors state that they performed self-supervised pre-training on the ImageNet training set, which consists of 1.28 million images. This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet-100**: A 100-category subset of ImageNet used for pre-training, which is also mentioned in the context of evaluating their models.

3. **CIFAR10 and CIFAR100**: These datasets are mentioned as benchmarks for object recognition tasks. CIFAR10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, while CIFAR100 contains 60,000 images in 100 classes.

4. **Caltech101**: This dataset consists of images from 101 object categories, used for object recognition tasks.

5. **Flowers**: The dataset used for flower classification, consisting of images from various flower species.

6. **Pets**: This dataset contains images of cats and dogs, used for classification tasks.

7. **CUB200**: The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset, which contains images of birds across 200 species.

8. **300W**: A dataset for facial landmark detection, which includes images with annotated facial landmarks.

9. **Leeds Sports Pose**: A dataset used for pose estimation tasks, containing images of sports activities.

10. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, used for facial attribute recognition.

11. **FC100**: A few-shot learning benchmark dataset.

12. **Plant Disease**: A dataset for detecting plant diseases from images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, the citation for **ImageNet** is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Similarly, I will find citations for the other datasets mentioned, ensuring to document them accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
