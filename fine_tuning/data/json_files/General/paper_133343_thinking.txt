To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dealing with uncertainty: balancing exploration and exploitation in deep recurrent reinforcement learning" by Valentina Zangirolami and Matteo Borrotti, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of techniques for predicting steering wheels in autonomous driving scenarios, which suggests that there may be datasets related to driving simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental settings section** (Section 6), where the authors describe the use of the **AirSim simulator** for training and testing their models. This section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used in their experiments.

In Section 6.1, the authors mention that they used the **AirSim NH environment**, which is a neighborhood environment designed for autonomous driving simulations. This indicates that the dataset consists of simulated driving scenarios, but I need to confirm if there are any specific datasets or benchmarks referenced.

I will also check the **References section** to find any citations related to the AirSim simulator or other datasets that may have been used in their experiments. The authors may have cited foundational works or datasets that are relevant to their research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the details of the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations. If the paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, I will look for the original sources of the AirSim simulator and any other relevant datasets mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the complete citations for each dataset, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental settings sections for dataset mentions.
2. Identify the AirSim simulator and its relevance to the experiments.
3. Check the references for citations related to datasets.
4. Compile dataset details and ensure full citations are included.
