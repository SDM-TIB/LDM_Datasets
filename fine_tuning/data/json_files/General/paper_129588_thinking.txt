To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hate Speech Detection via Dual Contrastive Learning" by Junyu Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **two publicly available English datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors introduce the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SemEval-2019 Task-5 Dataset**: This dataset is described as coming from the Task-5 of SemEval-2019, focusing on hate speech detection against women and immigrants. It contains a total of 11,971 samples, with 5,035 labeled as hate speech and 6,936 as non-hate speech. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Davidson Dataset**: This dataset was constructed by Davidson et al. and consists of 24,783 tweets, with 1,430 labeled as hate speech and 23,353 as non-hate speech. The authors note that this dataset is extremely imbalanced.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

- For the **SemEval-2019 Task-5 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Basile, V., Bosco, C., Fersini, E., Debora, N., Patti, V., Pardo, F. M. R., Rosso, P., & Sanguinetti, M. (2019). *Semeval-2019 task 5: Multilingual detection of hate speech against immigrants and women in twitter*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (pp. 54â€“63). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For the **Davidson Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Davidson, T., Warmsley, J., Macy, M., & Weber, I. (2017). *Automated hate speech detection and the problem of offensive language*. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 11(1), 512-515.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
