To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Calibrated Efficient Transformer for Lightweight Super-Resolution" by Wenbin Zou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method to single-image super-resolution (SISR) but does not specify datasets. However, the introduction mentions that the authors conducted experiments on widely used datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names in later sections.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their model. In this section, they mention using the following datasets:

1. **DIV2K**: A widely used dataset for image super-resolution containing 3450 LR-HR RGB image pairs.
2. **Flickr2K**: Another dataset used for training, which also contains LR-HR image pairs.
3. **Set5**: A standard benchmark dataset for evaluating super-resolution methods.
4. **Set14**: Another benchmark dataset commonly used in super-resolution research.
5. **B100**: A dataset used for testing super-resolution algorithms.
6. **Urban100**: A dataset that includes images of urban scenes for evaluating super-resolution performance.
7. **Manga109**: A dataset specifically designed for manga images, used in super-resolution tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
