To extract datasets from the research paper titled "D-SCORE: A Synapse-Inspired Approach for Filter Pruning" by Doyoung Park et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information about the datasets used in the study.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mention various model compression methods. They also refer to the datasets used for evaluation, which reinforces the idea that CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are central to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, the authors detail their experimental setup. They explicitly mention that they evaluated their methods on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** with the VGG-16 model and the **ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 dataset** with ResNet models. This confirms the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images, organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, where each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
