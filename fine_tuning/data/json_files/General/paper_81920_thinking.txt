To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can We Gain More from Orthogonality Regularizations in Training Deep CNNs?" by Nitin Bansal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions benchmarking the proposed methods on several popular computer vision datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors detail their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images of size 32x32 pixels, divided into 10 classes. The authors use a 5-1 training-testing split for their experiments.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images of size 32x32 pixels, but it is divided into 100 classes. The same 5-1 training-testing split is applied.

3. **SVHN (Street View House Numbers)**: This dataset is used for digit recognition and consists of over 600,000 labeled digits obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories. The authors mention training on the ILSVRC-2012 validation set.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton. *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1–5, 2011.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
