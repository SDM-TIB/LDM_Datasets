To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FibeRed: Fiberwise Dimensionality Reduction of Topologically Complex Data with Vector Bundles" by Luis Scoccola and Jose A. Perea, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and examples sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions demonstrating the algorithm on examples from **dynamical systems and chemistry**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **examples section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe three specific applications of their method. They mention:

1. **Dynamical system simulation**: The authors refer to a dataset generated from a double-gyre dynamical system, which is used to reconstruct an attractor—a torus.

2. **Conformation space of pentane**: The authors describe reconstructing the conformation space and energy landscape of the pentane molecule, indicating that they used a dataset of 20,000 conformers generated from RDKit.

3. **Conformation space of cyclooctane**: The authors mention using a dataset from a study that shows the conformation space of cyclooctane consists of a Klein bottle glued to a 2-sphere.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **dynamical system simulation**, the reference is:
  > Gisela D. Charó, Guillermo Artana, and Denisse Sciamarella. *Topology of dynamical reconstructions from Lagrangian data*. Phys. D, 405:132371, 2020. doi:10.1016/j.physd.2020.132371.

- For the **pentane dataset**, the reference is:
  > Roman M Balabin. *Enthalpy difference between conformations of normal alkanes: Raman spectroscopy study of n-pentane and n-butane*. The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, 113(6):1012–1019, 2009.

- For the **cyclooctane dataset**, the reference is:
  > Shawn Martin, Aidan Thompson, Evangelos A Coutsias, and Jean-Paul Watson. *Topology of cyclo-octane energy landscape*. The journal of chemical physics, 132(23):234115, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper.
