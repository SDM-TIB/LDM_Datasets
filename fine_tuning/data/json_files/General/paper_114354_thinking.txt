To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Understanding WordArt: Corner-Guided Transformer for Scene Text Recognition" by Xudong Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new dataset called **WordArt** to benchmark their performance in artistic text recognition. This is a clear indication that I need to gather details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (WordArt Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention that the WordArt dataset consists of **6316 artistic text images**, with a training set of **4805 images** and a testing set of **1511 images**. They also describe how the dataset was created by cropping word images from the TextSeg dataset, which contains various artistic texts.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **TextSeg dataset**, as it is referenced in the context of creating the WordArt dataset. The citation for the TextSeg dataset is:
> Xu, X., Zhang, Z., Wang, Z., Price, B., Wang, Z., Shi, H. (2021). *Rethinking text segmentation: A novel dataset and a text-specific refinement approach*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 12045–12055.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format. The main dataset I need to include is the **WordArt dataset**, along with its citation. 

The final entries will be:
1. **WordArt Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 6316 artistic text images, created to benchmark performance in artistic text recognition.
   - Citation: Xie, X., Fu, L., Zhang, Z., Wang, Z., Bai, X. (2023). *Toward Understanding WordArt: Corner-Guided Transformer for Scene Text Recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

2. **TextSeg Dataset**: A dataset used to create the WordArt dataset, containing images of posters, greeting cards, covers, and more.
   - Citation: Xu, X., Zhang, Z., Wang, Z., Price, B., Wang, Z., Shi, H. (2021). *Rethinking text segmentation: A novel dataset and a text-specific refinement approach*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 12045–12055.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are formatted correctly and ready for any further processing or review.
