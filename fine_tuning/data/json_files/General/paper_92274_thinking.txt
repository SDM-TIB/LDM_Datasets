To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Precision Policy Enforced Training (MuPPET)" by Aditya Rajagopal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, MuPPET, is applied to training CNNs on **ImageNet (ILSVRC12)**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on the **experiments** or **evaluation** sections. In this paper, the **Evaluation of MuPPET** section discusses the performance of the method on various networks and datasets, specifically mentioning **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**.

In the **performance evaluation** section, the authors provide results for the **Top-1 test accuracy** on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments. The paper does not provide extensive details about the datasets themselves, but it is clear that these are standard datasets in the field of deep learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **ImageNet (ILSVRC12)**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are derived from the same technical report by Alex Krizhevsky.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
