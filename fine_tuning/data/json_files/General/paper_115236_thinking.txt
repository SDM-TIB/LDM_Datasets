To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPATIO-TEMPORAL WIND SPEED FORECASTING USING GRAPH NETWORKS AND NOVEL TRANSFORMER ARCHITECTURES" by Lars Ã˜degaard Bentsen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on forecasting using data from **14 offshore measurement stations**. This suggests that there is a dataset related to these measurement stations.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Methodology)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the data was obtained from the **Norwegian Meteorological Institute** and is available through the **Frost API**. The dataset consists of **10-minute averaged measurements** on various meteorological variables, including air temperature, air pressure, dew point, relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed.

The authors specify that the dataset includes measurements from **14 out of 25 available stations** for the period between **June 23, 2015, and February 28, 2022**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is provided by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and is openly available through the Frost API, it may not have a formal citation like a typical research dataset. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Dataset**: Norwegian Meteorological Institute data
  - **Description**: Meteorological measurements recorded on the Norwegian continental shelf, including air temperature, air pressure, dew point, relative humidity, wind direction, and wind speed.
  - **Access**: Available through the Frost API (https://frost.met.no/index.html).
  - **Period**: June 23, 2015, to February 28, 2022.
  - **Stations**: 14 offshore measurement stations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant details about the dataset are captured accurately.
