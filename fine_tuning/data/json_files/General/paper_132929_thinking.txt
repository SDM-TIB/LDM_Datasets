To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Geometric Structure of Fully-Connected ReLU Layers" by Jonatan Vallin, Karl Larsson, and Mats G. Larson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the theoretical aspects of ReLU layers but do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Upon reaching the **experiments section**, I will look for any subsections that might detail the datasets used for validation or testing. If the authors describe any datasets, I will take note of their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to capture the complete citation format as provided in the references.

If I find datasets mentioned, I will compile the information, including:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is organized clearly, ready for further processing or review. If no datasets are mentioned, I will note that as well.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough extraction of any datasets referenced in the paper while maintaining the importance of proper citation.
