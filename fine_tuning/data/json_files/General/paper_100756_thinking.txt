To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greedy-layer Pruning: Speeding up Transformer Models for Natural Language Processing" by David Peer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of transformer models and mentions knowledge distillation and pruning, but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various transformer models and their applications but do not mention specific datasets. I will proceed to the **experimental section (section 4)**, where they describe their evaluation setup.

In **section 4.1 (Setup)**, the authors mention using the **GLUE benchmark** for their experiments. The GLUE benchmark is a collection of datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems. They specifically mention the following datasets included in the GLUE benchmark:

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: A dataset for assessing the acceptability of English sentences.
2. **SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
3. **MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)**: A dataset for paraphrase identification.
4. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: A dataset for measuring semantic similarity between sentences.
5. **QQP (Quora Question Pairs)**: A dataset for identifying duplicate questions.
6. **MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for natural language inference.
7. **QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)**: A dataset for question-answering tasks.
8. **RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)**: A dataset for recognizing entailment between text pairs.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the GLUE benchmark and its constituent datasets. The GLUE benchmark is cited as follows:

For the individual datasets, I will look for their original papers or sources:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
