To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When and Why Test Generators for Deep Learning Produce Invalid Inputs: an Empirical Study" by Vincenzo Riccio and Paolo Tonella, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on Test Input Generators (TIGs) and their effectiveness, which may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **empirical setup section**, specifically looking for any references to datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors mention three popular image datasets: **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)**, **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**, and **ImageNet-1K**. Each dataset is described in terms of its characteristics and the classification tasks associated with them.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used in the experiments and to gather any additional details about their application in the study.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

1. **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST)**:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

2. **Street View House Numbers (SVHN)**:
   > Netzer, Y., Wang, T., Coates, A., Bissacco, A., Wu, B., & Ng, A. Y. (2011). Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning. In *NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning*.

3. **ImageNet-1K**:

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
