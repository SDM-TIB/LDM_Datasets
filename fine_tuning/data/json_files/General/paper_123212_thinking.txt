To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Feature Perturbation Augmentation for Reliable Evaluation of Importance Estimators in Neural Networks" by Lennart Brocki and Neo Christopher Chung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they applied their proposed method on three datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **Food101**, and **ImageNet**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will check the **methods section**, specifically under "Datasets and Importance Estimators," where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They confirm that they used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **Food101**: A dataset containing 101 food categories, with 101,000 images in total, where each category has 1,000 images.
3. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories, widely used for image classification tasks.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their models on these datasets, reinforcing that these are indeed the datasets they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images," University of Toronto Technical Report, 2009.

- For **Food101**, the citation is:
  > Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin, and Luc Van Gool, "Food-101—mining discriminative components with random forests," in European Conference on Computer Vision, Springer, 2014, pp. 446–461.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei, "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database," in 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, IEEE, 2009, pp. 248–255.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited.
