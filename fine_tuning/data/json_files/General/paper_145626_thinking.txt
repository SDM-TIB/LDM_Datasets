To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning rate adaptive stochastic gradient descent optimization methods: numerical simulations for deep learning methods for partial differential equations and convergence analyses" by Steffen Dereich et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of a learning-rate-adaptive variant of the Adam optimizer in various neural network learning problems, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their experiments in detail. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used for training and testing their models.

In **Subsection 3.1**, the authors mention a **supervised learning problem** where they train fully-connected feedforward ANNs to approximate a target function. They specify that they use a dataset with 2000 independently generated test samples, but they do not provide a specific name for this dataset.

In **Subsection 3.2**, they discuss the **Deep Kolmogorov method (DKM)** for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). They mention using a dataset for a heat PDE with 25 dimensions, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

In **Subsection 3.3**, they describe using **Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** for a sine-Gordon type PDE and an Allen-Cahn PDE. They mention datasets for these PDEs but do not provide specific names.

In **Subsection 3.4**, they mention using a dataset for the **Deep Ritz method** for a Poisson equation, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

After reviewing the **References section**, I will look for any citations that may correspond to the datasets mentioned in the experiments. However, it appears that the authors did not provide specific dataset names or citations for the datasets used in their experiments.

Since the datasets are not explicitly named or cited in the paper, I will note this in my extraction process. I will summarize the datasets based on the descriptions provided in the numerical experiments section, but I will indicate that specific citations are not available.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight the lack of specific dataset names and citations while providing a summary of the datasets based on the context given in the paper.
