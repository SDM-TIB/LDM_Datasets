To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Data Poisoning for Fake News Detection" by Federico Siciliano et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the manipulation of fake news detection models through adversarial attacks, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section more closely. Here, the authors mention the need for robust defenses against data poisoning techniques but do not specify any datasets. 

Moving on to the **results and discussion** section, I will look for any references to datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic data, which consists of 10,000 real values, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. 

In the **conclusion and future work** section, the authors list several datasets they plan to use in future experiments, including:
1. **PolitiFact**
2. **Gossipcop**
3. **FakeNewsNet**
4. **Weibo21**
5. **FbMultiLingMisinfo**

These datasets are relevant to the field of fake news detection and are mentioned as commonly analyzed datasets. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **FakeNewsNet**, the citation is:
  > Kai Shu et al. "FakeNewsNet: A Data Repository with News Content, Social Context and Dynamic Information for Studying Fake News on Social Media". In: arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.01286 (2018).

- For **PolitiFact**, the citation is:
  > PolitiFact. "PolitiFact: A project of the Tampa Bay Times". Available at: https://www.politifact.com/.

- For **Gossipcop**, the citation is:
  > GossipCop. "GossipCop: Fact-checking celebrity news". Available at: https://www.gossipcop.com/.

- For **Weibo21**, the citation is:
  > Weibo21. "Weibo: A Chinese social media platform". Available at: https://www.weibo.com/.

- For **FbMultiLingMisinfo**, the citation is:
  > Giorgio Barnab√≤ et al. "FbMultiLingMisinfo: Challenging Large-Scale Multilingual Benchmark for Misinformation Detection". In: International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) - to appear. IEEE. 2022.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
