To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transient Classification in low SNR Gravitational Wave data using Deep Learning" by Rahul Nigam, Amit Mishra, and Pranath Reddy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the methodology section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training the models.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of detecting gravitational waves and the need for classification of transient signals. However, they do not specify any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the dataset created for training their transient detection model. They mention that the dataset consists of eight different classes of transients, including Sine Gaussian, Ring Down, Gaussian, Supernova, Cusp, Black Hole Merger, Chirping Sine Gaussian, and Blip. They also state that they plan to generate a total of 48,000 transient signals, with 6,000 in each class.

The specific classes of transients are as follows:
1. **Sine Gaussian (SG)**
2. **Ring Down (RG)**
3. **Gaussian (GN)**
4. **Supernova (SN)**
5. **Cusp (CSP)**
6. **Black Hole Merger (LBM)**
7. **Chirping Sine Gaussian (CSG)**
8. **Blip (Blip)**

The authors describe how these signals are generated and their characteristics, but they do not provide a formal dataset citation or reference to an existing dataset. Instead, they create their own dataset for the purpose of this study.

Next, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works provide datasets that could be relevant. However, the references primarily discuss methods and previous works in gravitational wave detection and do not mention specific datasets that the authors used.

Since the authors generated their own dataset, I will note that the dataset does not have a formal citation like established datasets do. Instead, I will summarize the dataset creation process and the classes of transients included.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to highlight that the dataset is generated by the authors and does not have a formal citation. The details of the classes and the total number of signals will be included in the summary.

In conclusion, I will document the dataset information as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Generated Transient Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset created by the authors consisting of eight classes of transient signals for gravitational wave detection, totaling 48,000 signals (6,000 per class).
- **Classes**: Sine Gaussian, Ring Down, Gaussian, Supernova, Cusp, Black Hole Merger, Chirping Sine Gaussian, Blip.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the dataset information from the paper while acknowledging the lack of a formal citation.
