To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Model Based Reinforcement Learning with Non-Gaussian Environment Dynamics and its Application to Portfolio Optimization" by Huifang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention the datasets used for experiments. In this case, it states that the authors experimented with various stocks from three different financial markets: **Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P**.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they used historical daily price data from **Yahoo Finance** for stocks in the three markets. They specify that the dataset includes data from **January 4, 2011, to March 31, 2021**, with different splits for training, validation, and testing.

The paper indicates that they selected 10 stocks based on their turnover rates, which is a crucial detail for understanding the dataset's composition. However, the specific stock names are not listed in the dataset section, so I will need to look for them in the text or tables that follow.

In the **appendices**, the authors provide parameters for the stocks in the Dow and S&P markets, which can be useful for understanding the dataset's characteristics. However, the exact stock names and their corresponding parameters are listed in tables, which I will need to reference.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Yahoo Finance Dataset**: The dataset consists of historical daily price data for various stocks from the Dow, NASDAQ, and S&P markets, covering the period from January 4, 2011, to March 31, 2021. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Yahoo Finance. *Yahoo Finance Historical Data*. Available at: https://finance.yahoo.com/

2. **Stock Parameters**: The specific stocks used in the experiments are detailed in the tables in the appendix, but the paper does not provide a formal citation for these stocks. However, I can summarize that the dataset includes stocks from the Dow and S&P markets, with parameters estimated for each stock.

After gathering all this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
