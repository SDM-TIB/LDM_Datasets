To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VI-PANN: Harnessing Transfer Learning and Uncertainty-Aware Variational Inference for Improved Generalization in Audio Pattern Recognition" by John Fischer et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **AudioSet**: This is described as a large-scale audio event recognition dataset consisting of 2.1 million 10-second audio samples, extracted from YouTube videos and hand-annotated. The dataset has an ontology of 527 classes and is heavily imbalanced and multi-label.

2. **ESC-50**: This dataset consists of 2,000 five-second recordings organized into 50 classes, suitable for evaluating fine-grained event recognition capabilities. It is split into 5 folds for cross-validation.

3. **UrbanSound8K**: This dataset contains 8,732 urban sound excerpts, categorized into 10 classes, with each excerpt lasting up to 4 seconds. It is split into 10 folds for cross-validation.

4. **DCASE2013**: This dataset includes 100 audio samples, each 30 seconds long, representing various acoustic scenes and events, and is split into 5 folds for cross-validation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **AudioSet**, the citation is:

- For **ESC-50**, the citation is:

- For **UrbanSound8K**, the citation is:
  > Justin Salamon, Christopher Jacoby, and Juan Pablo Bello. *A dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research*. In Proceedings of the 22nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia, 2014, pp. 1041–1044.

- For **DCASE2013**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
