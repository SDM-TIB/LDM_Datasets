To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Donâ€™t Be So Dense: Sparse-to-Sparse GAN Training Without Sacrificing Performance" by Shiwei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the training of sparse GANs and mentions "extensive experiments with modern GAN architectures," which suggests that datasets are likely involved, but no specific names are provided yet.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors conduct experiments with **BigGAN** on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these two datasets are used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather more details about these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models, particularly in image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset contains over 14 million images categorized into thousands of classes. It is widely used for training deep learning models, especially in the context of image recognition and classification.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are typically well-established in the literature:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2010. [Available online](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. [DOI: 10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
