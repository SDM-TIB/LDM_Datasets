To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effects of annotation granularity in deep learning models for histopathological images" by Jiangbo Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions that the study involves different granularity levels of annotation for histopathological images, which suggests that datasets with varying annotation types are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, particularly the subsection labeled **Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using the **TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)** database, which contains whole slide images of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). The authors specify that they downloaded 10 whole slide images from this database, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the **Related Work** or **Results** sections. The authors reference several datasets, including:

1. **BACH Dataset**: This dataset is related to breast cancer and is part of the ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Histology Images. It consists of microscopic images with image-wise annotation and whole slide images (WSIs) with pixel-wise annotation.

2. **CAMELYON16 Dataset**: This dataset contains 400 WSIs with pixel-wise annotation for sentinel lymph node analysis.

3. **DigestPath 2019 Datasets**: Two datasets are mentioned here:
   - A dataset for Signet ring cell pathology, which includes 700 pathological slides annotated with bounding boxes.
   - A colonoscopy tissue segment dataset with 1000 pathological slides annotated with pixel-wise granularity.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **TCGA dataset**, the citation is:
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). "The Cancer Genome Atlas: An immeasurable source of knowledge." Contemporary oncology, 2015, 19(1A), pp. A68.

- For the **BACH dataset**, the citation is:
  > Aresta, G., AraÃºjo, T., Kwok, S.S., Chennamsetty, M.S., Safwan, M., Alex, V., Marami, B., Prastawa, M., Chan, M., and Donovan, M. "BACH: Grand challenge on breast cancer histology images." Medical image analysis, 2019.

- For the **CAMELYON16 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Litjens, G., Bandi, P., Ehteshami Bejnordi, P., Geessink, O., Balkenhol, M., Bult, P., Halilovic, A., Hermsen, M., van de Loo, R., and Vogels, R. "1399 H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset." GigaScience, 2018, 7(6), pp. giy065.

- For the **DigestPath 2019 datasets**, the citations are:
  > DigestPath 2019. "DigestPath 2019 competition datasets." [Specific citation details would need to be retrieved from the references if available.]

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
