To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Linguistic Properties of Monolingual BERTs with Typological Classification among Languages" by Elena Sofia Ruzzetti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific datasets in the methodology.

In the **method section**, particularly in **section 3.1**, the authors mention using the **World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)** as a resource for typological classification. This indicates that WALS is a dataset used in their analysis. I will note this down.

Next, I will check the **experiments section (section 4)** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. The authors describe their experimental setup and the languages they selected for their analysis, which includes various monolingual BERT models. However, they do not specify any additional datasets beyond WALS.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the WALS dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Dryer, M. S., & Haspelmath, M. (2013). *WALS Online*. Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig.

Since WALS is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and completeness.
