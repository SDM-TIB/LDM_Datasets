To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computationally Efficient and Statistically Optimal Robust High-Dimensional Linear Regression" by Yinan Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

1. **Read the Abstract and Introduction**: I will start by examining the abstract and introduction sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key contributions and may reference datasets used in the study.

2. **Identify Sections on Datasets**: Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets, typically labeled as "Datasets," "Data," or similar. In this paper, I will check sections that describe the experiments or methodologies, as these often include details about the datasets used.

3. **Locate Dataset Descriptions**: In the relevant sections, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, features, etc.). I will also note any specific tasks or experiments associated with each dataset.

4. **Check the References**: After identifying the datasets, I will consult the references section to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

5. **Document Each Dataset**: For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
   - **Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as found in the references section of the paper.

6. **Compile the Information**: Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and citation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
