To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Channel Dimensions to Isolate Outliers for Low-Bit Weight Quantization of Large Language Models" by Jung Hwan Heo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the evaluation of their method on various language modeling benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to benchmark tasks.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will pay particular attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Evaluation Setup" or "Datasets." 

In section 4.1 (Evaluation Setup), the authors mention using a calibration set from "The Pile" dataset for their quantization experiments. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

Additionally, in section 4.2 (Base Model Quantization), the authors refer to the "MMLU" (Massive Multi-task Language Understanding) benchmark and the "HumanEval" dataset for evaluating their models. I will ensure to capture these references as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide complete information for future reference.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **The Pile**: 
   > Leo Gao, Stella Biderman, Sid Black, Laurence Golding, Travis Hoppe, Charles Foster, Jason Phang, Horace He, Anish Thite, Noa Nabeshima, et al. *The pile: An 800gb dataset of diverse text for language modeling*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

2. **MMLU**:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. CoRR, abs/2009.03300, 2020. URL https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300.

3. **HumanEval**:
   > Chen, Mark, et al. *Evaluating large language models trained on code*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.03374, 2021.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
