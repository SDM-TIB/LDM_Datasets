To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Data Ability Boundary in LLMsâ€™ Math Reasoning" by Zui Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, while the introduction often outlines the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Ability Boundary of Reasoning Paths)**, particularly subsection 2.2, which discusses the datasets involved in the study. Here, the authors mention six datasets:

1. **GSM8K**: This dataset is described as containing 7,473 training examples and 1,319 test examples, focusing on grade school math problems.
2. **MATH**: This dataset consists of 7,500 training examples and 5,000 test examples, featuring challenging competition-level math problems.
3. **GSM-HARD**: A variant of GSM8K, this dataset is used for testing numerical robustness.
4. **SVAMP**: This dataset contains 1,000 test examples and is a modified version of ASDiv.
5. **ASDiv**: This dataset has 2,215 test examples and covers elementary school problem types.
6. **TAL-SCQ5K**: This dataset includes 5,000 examples covering various mathematical topics.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details or examples related to these datasets, as they often provide further context or specific examples that can be useful for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

  > Shen-yun Miao, Chao-Chun Liang, and Keh-Yih Su. *A Diverse Corpus for Evaluating and Developing English Math Word Problem Solvers*. In Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2020.

- For **TAL-SCQ5K**, I will need to check if a specific citation is provided in the references or if it is a newly introduced dataset without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their citations into a structured format for easy reference and use in future research or applications.
