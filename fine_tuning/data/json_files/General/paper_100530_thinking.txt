To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prevent the Language Model from being Overconfident in Neural Machine Translation" by Mengqi Miao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on three large-scale translation tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine the **experimental settings section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In this section, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **WMT14 English-to-German**: The authors state they used 4.5 million training examples, with newstest2013 as the validation set and newstest2014 as the test set.

2. **WMT14 English-to-French**: This dataset contains approximately 36 million sentence pairs, with newstest2013 as the validation set and newstest2014 as the test set.

3. **WMT19 Chinese-to-English**: The authors mention using 20.5 million training examples, with newstest2018 as the validation set and newstest2019 as the test set.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, so I will look for the appropriate citations:

- For the **WMT14 English-to-German** dataset, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

- For the **WMT14 English-to-French** dataset, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

- For the **WMT19 Chinese-to-English** dataset, the citation is:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2019). *Findings of the 2019 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT)*. In Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–28.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
