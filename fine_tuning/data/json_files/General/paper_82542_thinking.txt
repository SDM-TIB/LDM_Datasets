To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trust Region Based Adversarial Attack on Neural Networks" by Zhewei Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention testing their methods on **Cifar-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely central to their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used. In this case, I will focus on the **experiments** section, where the authors typically describe the datasets in more detail. I will also check the **background** section for any additional context or references to the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the **Cifar-10** and **ImageNet** datasets for their experiments. They provide some details about these datasets, such as their purpose in evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed adversarial attack methods.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Cifar-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

2. **ImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **Cifar-10**: A dataset used for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, particularly in image classification tasks.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models in computer vision.

I will ensure that the full citations are included for each dataset to maintain proper attribution and facilitate further research.
