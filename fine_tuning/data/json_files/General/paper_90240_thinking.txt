To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pairwise Multi-Class Document Classification for Semantic Relations between Wikipedia Articles" by Malte Ostendorff et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the authors performed experiments on a "newly proposed dataset of 32,168 Wikipedia article pairs and Wikidata properties that define the semantic document relations." This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about the dataset. The introduction reiterates the use of a dataset composed of Wikipedia article pairs and mentions the semantic relations defined by Wikidata properties. This confirms the dataset's relevance to the study.

I will then look into **section 3.1 (Data set & Use case)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. They explain that the dataset consists of 32,168 pairs of Wikipedia articles, with each pair linked by specific Wikidata properties that define their semantic relations. This section provides essential information about the dataset's structure and purpose.

In **section 3.1.2 (Training data)**, the authors elaborate on how the dataset was constructed using Wikipedia and Wikidata, emphasizing the semantic relations between document pairs. They also mention the specific properties selected from Wikidata, which further clarifies the dataset's content.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors do not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but they do reference the original sources of the Wikipedia and Wikidata content. Therefore, I will cite these sources as follows:

- For Wikipedia:
  > Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org).

- For Wikidata:
  > Vrandecic, D., & Krötzsch, M. (2014). *Wikidata: a free collaborative knowledge base*. Commun. ACM, 57(10), 78-85. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2629489](https://doi.org/10.1145/2629489).

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Wikipedia Article Pairs Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 32,168 pairs of Wikipedia articles linked by semantic relations defined by Wikidata properties.
   - **Citation**: 
     - Wikipedia contributors. *Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia*. [https://www.wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org).
     - Vrandecic, D., & Krötzsch, M. (2014). *Wikidata: a free collaborative knowledge base*. Commun. ACM, 57(10), 78-85. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2629489](https://doi.org/10.1145/2629489).

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further use or analysis.
