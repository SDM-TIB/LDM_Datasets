To extract datasets from the research paper titled "P3SGD: Patient Privacy Preserving SGD for Regularizing Deep CNNs in Pathological Image Classification" by Bingzhe Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on a "real-world clinical dataset," which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (section 4) where the authors describe their experiments. In section 4.1, they mention that the dataset consists of **1216 patients**, each containing around **50 image patches**. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's structure and size.

I will also look for any specific names or titles given to the dataset. In this case, the authors refer to it simply as a "real-world clinical dataset" without a specific name. However, they do mention that the dataset was collected by doctors in their team and that it is used for the task of **glomerulus classification**.

To ensure I have the full citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** for any related works that might have used or described this dataset. However, since the dataset is described as collected by the authors themselves, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Real-world clinical dataset (no formal name provided)
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of 1216 patients, each containing around 50 image patches, used for glomerulus classification.
   - **Citation**: Since this dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is collected by the authors' team and does not have a specific reference.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the lack of a formal citation for the dataset while providing all relevant details.
