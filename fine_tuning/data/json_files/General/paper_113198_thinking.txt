To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Object Detector for Different Modalities" by Xiaoke Shen and Ioannis Stamos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their model on the **SUN RGB-D dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is significant for their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the methodology section, the authors describe the **SUN RGB-D dataset** in detail, noting that it provides both point cloud and RGB images. They mention that the dataset is split into a training set with 5285 images and a testing set with 5050 images, which confirms its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **results** section to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer to any other datasets used for comparison. However, the primary focus remains on the **SUN RGB-D dataset**.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the **SUN RGB-D dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **SUN RGB-D dataset**:
  > Song, S., Lichtenberg, S.P., & Xiao, J. (2015). *SUN RGB-D: A RGB-D Scene Understanding Benchmark Suite*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **SUN RGB-D dataset**: An indoor dataset that provides both point cloud and RGB images, with a training set of 5285 images and a testing set of 5050 images.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
