To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RODD: Robust Outlier Detection in Data Cubes" by Lara Kuhlmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a framework for evaluating outlier detection methods in data cubes and states that the authors applied their method to real-world data. This suggests that there may be datasets used for evaluation or examples.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors discuss the challenges of outlier detection in data cubes and mention that they synthesized data cubes for their experiments. This indicates that there are datasets created for the purpose of this research.

In **section 5 (Simulation Study)**, the authors describe the process of synthesizing data cubes. They mention that they created eight data cubes, each with three categorical dimensions, based on a real-world dataset from a German household devices selling company. This is a key dataset that needs to be documented.

Additionally, in **section 7 (Application to Real Data)**, the authors provide a subset of a real-world dataset that includes sales data for different products sold through various distribution channels. This dataset is crucial as it validates the proposed method.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets identified:

1. **Synthetic Data Cubes**: The authors synthesized 3,600 data cubes for their simulation study, which were constructed based on expected values and interaction effects from a real-world dataset. However, the specific citation for the original dataset used for synthesis is not provided in the paper.

2. **Real-World Household Device Sales Data**: This dataset includes sales numbers for three different products sold via three different distribution channels over several months. The authors provide a table summarizing this data, but again, they do not provide a formal citation for the source of this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any of the datasets mentioned have corresponding citations. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the synthetic data cubes since they were generated for the study. However, the real-world dataset is derived from a German household devices selling company, but no formal citation is given.

In summary, I will document the datasets as follows:

- For the **Synthetic Data Cubes**, I will note that they were created for the purpose of the study but do not have a formal citation.
- For the **Real-World Household Device Sales Data**, I will note that it is based on data from a German household devices selling company, but again, no formal citation is provided.

Finally, I will ensure to clearly state that while the datasets are described, the paper lacks formal citations for them, which is an important aspect to highlight in the documentation.
