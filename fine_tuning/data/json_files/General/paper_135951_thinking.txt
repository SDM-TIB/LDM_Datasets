To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An explanation for the distribution characteristics of stock returns" by Bo Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on stock returns and their distribution characteristics, but it does not specify datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section III (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the author discusses the data used in the experiments. Here, the author mentions three specific stock price indices that are analyzed:

1. **China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300)**: The paper states that the data for CSI 300 is collected from January 4, 2005, to November 1, 2023.

2. **Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)**: The data for SPX is noted to range from September 20, 1982, to October 6, 2023.

3. **Nikkei 225 Index (N225)**: The data for N225 is mentioned as being from March 25, 1985, to October 6, 2023.

In this section, the author provides a detailed description of the datasets, including the time frames for the data collection, which is crucial for understanding the context of the analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the indices are typically found in financial literature or databases, but since the paper does not provide specific references for the datasets themselves, I will use standard references for these indices:

- For **China Securities Index 300 (CSI 300)**, a common citation is:
  > China Securities Index Co., Ltd. *CSI 300 Index*. Available at: [CSI 300 Index](http://www.csindex.com.cn/zh-CN/indices/index-detail/000300).

- For **Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)**, the citation is:
  > Standard & Poor's. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: [S&P 500 Index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/).

- For **Nikkei 225 Index (N225)**, the citation is:
  > Nikkei Inc. *Nikkei 225 Index*. Available at: [Nikkei 225 Index](https://indexes.nikkei.co.jp/en/nkave/).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing the necessary citations for further reference.
