To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A-ESRGAN: Training Real-World Blind Super-Resolution with Attention U-Net Discriminators" by Zihao Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the model's performance on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, particularly **subsection 4.2 (Testing Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for testing their model. Here, they state that they used real-world images from five standard benchmark datasets:

1. **Set5**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating super-resolution methods and contains a variety of images, including portraits and scenery.

2. **Set14**: Another widely used dataset for super-resolution, featuring a diverse set of images.

3. **BSD100**: This dataset consists of 100 images and is often used for benchmarking image processing algorithms.

4. **Sun-Hays80**: This dataset includes images from various scenes and is used to assess the performance of super-resolution techniques.

5. **Urban100**: A dataset that focuses on urban scenes, providing a different set of challenges for super-resolution tasks.

The authors argue that a good general super-resolution model should perform well across all five datasets, indicating their importance in the evaluation of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **Set5**, the citation is:

- For **Set14**, the citation is:

- For **Sun-Hays80**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for further processing or review.
