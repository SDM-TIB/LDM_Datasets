To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Higher Order Conditional Random Fields in Deep Neural Networks" by Anurag Arnab et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance on the **PASCAL VOC benchmark** and the **PASCAL Context dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 6) to confirm the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **PASCAL VOC 2012** dataset and the **PASCAL Context** dataset. They provide details about the number of images and the nature of the annotations, which is crucial for understanding the datasets.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about each dataset:

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for semantic segmentation tasks and contains images with detailed object annotations. The authors mention that they trained their model using the training set of this dataset.

2. **PASCAL Context Dataset**: This dataset extends the PASCAL VOC dataset by providing additional annotations for a larger number of object classes (59 classes compared to the 20 in VOC). The authors trained on the provided training set of 4,998 images and evaluated on the validation set of 5,105 images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., & Zisserman, A. (2010). The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 88(2), 303-338.

- For the **PASCAL Context Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mottaghi, R., Chen, X., Liu, X., Cho, N.G., Lee, S.W., Fidler, S., & Urtasun, R. (2014). The Role of Context for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in the Wild. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)*, 891-898.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
