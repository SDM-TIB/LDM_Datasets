To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Apples and Oranges? Assessing Image Quality over Content Recognition" by Junyong You and Zheng Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the details about datasets are likely to be found in the experiments section.

In **section IV (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly mention that they used two datasets for their experiments:

1. **SPAQ Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the only publicly available dataset that contains both ground-truth content recognition (with nine categories) and quality assessment. This is a significant dataset for the research.

2. **KonIQ-10k Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing images that were classified into ten categories after manual validation and adjustment. The categories include animal, artifact, cityscape, human, indoor scene, landscape, night scene, plant, vehicle, and others.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **SPAQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Fang, H. Zhu, Y. Zeng, K. Ma, and Z. Wang. "Perceptual quality assessment of smartphone photography." In Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Virtual, Jun. 2020.

- For the **KonIQ-10k Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Hosu, H. Lin, T. Sziranyi, and D. Saupe. "KonIQ-10k: An ecologically valid database for deep learning of blind image quality assessment." IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol. 29, pp. 4041-4056, Jan. 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
