To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Max-Margin Contrastive Learning" by Anshul Shah et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on "standard vision benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, containing over a million images across 1,000 categories.
2. **ImageNet-100**: A subset of ImageNet-1k, containing 100 categories, used for evaluating performance on a smaller scale.
3. **STL-10**: A dataset for image classification that contains 10 classes with 5,000 labeled images and 100,000 unlabeled images.
4. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.
5. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 248–255.

- For **STL-10**:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A. Y., & Lee, H. (2011). An Analysis of Single-Layer Networks in Unsupervised Feature Learning. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, 215–223.

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. (2009). Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images.

- For **UCF101**:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes from Videos in The Wild. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for future reference or processing.
