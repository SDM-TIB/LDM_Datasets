To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Video Action Detection with Token Dropout and Context Refinement" by Lei Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is validated on three benchmark datasets: **AVA**, **UCF101-24**, and **JHMDB**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experiments conducted.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 4.1, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **AVA Dataset**: The authors describe it as a large-scale benchmark containing 299 videos, annotated at 1 FPS for action detection. This dataset is used to evaluate their method's performance on 60 common action classes.

2. **UCF101-24 Dataset**: This is mentioned as a subset of the UCF101 dataset, consisting of 3,207 videos from 24 sports classes. The authors note that each video contains a single action class, and they report performance based on a specific train/test split.

3. **JHMDB Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset contains 928 trimmed videos from 21 action classes, and they report average results over three standard splits.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **AVA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chunhui Gu, Chen Sun, David A. Ross, Carl Vondrick, Caroline Pantofaru, Yeqing Li, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, George Toderici, Susanna Ricco, Rahul Sukthankar, et al. *AVA: A video dataset of spatio-temporally localized atomic visual actions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2018.

- For the **UCF101-24 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For the **JHMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hueihan Jhuang, Juergen Gall, Silvia Zuffi, Cordelia Schmid, and Michael J. Black. *Towards understanding action recognition*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
