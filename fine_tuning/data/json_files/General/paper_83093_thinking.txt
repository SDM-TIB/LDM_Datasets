To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Compositional Representations of Interacting Systems with Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Comparative Study of Lattice Proteins" by Jérôme Tubiana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the context and motivation for their research. This section often contains references to datasets used in the study or related works that may have utilized specific datasets.

I will then examine the **methods and results sections** for detailed descriptions of the datasets. In this paper, the authors mention using **Lattice Protein (LP) models** and generating a collection of **36,000 sequences** that specifically fold into a structure (SA) based on certain criteria. This indicates that there is a dataset generated from simulations.

In the **results section**, the authors describe the characteristics of the Lattice Protein sequences and how they were generated. They mention that these sequences share statistical features with real protein sequences, which suggests that the dataset is relevant for understanding protein interactions.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the Lattice Protein models and cite relevant works that describe the methodology for generating these sequences.

The full citation for the dataset is:
- For the Lattice Protein sequences, the citation is:
  > H. Jacquin, A. Gilson, E. Shakhnovich, S. Cocco, and R. Monasson. *PLoS computational biology 12, e1004889 (2016)*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
