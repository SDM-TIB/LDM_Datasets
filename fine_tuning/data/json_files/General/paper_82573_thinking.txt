To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Steerable ePCA: Rotationally Invariant Exponential Family PCA" by Zhizhen Zhao, Lydia T. Liu, and Amit Singer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of their method using **simulated XFEL datasets** and **rotated Yale B face data**. This suggests that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will examine the **numerical results section** where the authors discuss their experiments. They mention using **simulated XFEL diffraction intensity maps** of a lysozyme and the **Yale B face database**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their sizes and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the XFEL dataset as containing **140,000 noiseless diffraction intensity maps** of a lysozyme, with each image being **128 × 128 pixels** in size. They also mention that the average pixel intensity is rescaled to **0.01** for the experiments.

For the Yale B face dataset, they state that it contains **5760 single light source images** of **10 subjects** with **9 poses** each, and that the images are captured under different ambient illuminations. The authors downsample the images to **64 × 64 pixels** for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **XFEL dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. F. Hantke, T. Ekeberg, and F. R. N. C. Maia. *Condor: A simulation tool for flash X-ray imaging*. Journal of Applied Crystallography, vol. 49, no. 4, pp. 1356–1362, 2016.

2. For the **Yale B face dataset**, the citation is:
   > K.-C. Lee, J. Ho, and D. J. Kriegman. *Acquiring linear subspaces for face recognition under variable lighting*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis & Machine Intelligence, no. 5, pp. 684–698, 2005.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
