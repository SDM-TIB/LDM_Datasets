To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Object Detection in Indian Food Platters using Transfer Learning with YOLOv4" by Deepanshu Pandey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a comprehensively labeled Indian food dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the challenges of recognizing Indian food dishes due to the lack of annotated datasets. They introduce two datasets: **IndianFood10** and **IndianFood20**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **IndianFood10**: This dataset consists of 11,547 images with annotations for 10 traditional Indian food items. The authors mention that it includes multi-dish images and provides a breakdown of the number of images per class.

2. **IndianFood20**: This is an extension of IndianFood10, containing 17,817 images and including 10 additional traditional Indian food classes. The authors note that this dataset is preliminary and that they have not reported results for it yet.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **references section** for the relevant citations. The authors mention that the datasets are available on Google Drive and IEEE Dataport, but they do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves. Therefore, I will create citations based on the paper's authorship and publication details.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- For **IndianFood10**:
  > Deepanshu Pandey, Purva Parmar, Gauri Toshniwal, Mansi Goel, Vishesh Agrawal, Shivangi Dhiman, Lavanya Gupta, and Ganesh Bagler. *Object Detection in Indian Food Platters using Transfer Learning with YOLOv4*. 2022. Available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/a7h5-2d06.

- For **IndianFood20**:
  > Deepanshu Pandey, Purva Parmar, Gauri Toshniwal, Mansi Goel, Vishesh Agrawal, Shivangi Dhiman, Lavanya Gupta, and Ganesh Bagler. *Object Detection in Indian Food Platters using Transfer Learning with YOLOv4*. 2022. Available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/a7h5-2d06.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the research paper.
