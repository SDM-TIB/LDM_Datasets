To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Structured Surrogate Loss and Regularization in Structured Prediction" by Heejin Choi, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the research, including any datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (like the number of instances, features, or classes).

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional mentions of datasets, especially if the authors compare their results across different datasets or highlight specific characteristics of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if I find that the paper mentions the "Yeast Dataset" and provides a brief description, I will look for the citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the original source of the dataset online.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while maintaining proper academic standards in citation.
