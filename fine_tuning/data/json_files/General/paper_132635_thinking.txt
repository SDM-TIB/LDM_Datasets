To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Cadastral Boundary Detection of Very High Resolution Images Using Mask R-CNN" by Neda Rahimpour Anaraki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental study sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of cadastral mapping and the need for innovative tools, but I need to look for specific datasets. The introduction may not explicitly mention datasets but could provide context for their use.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their approach using Mask R-CNN. They mention using images from various sources, including aerial images and ortho images, but I need to confirm if these are part of a formal dataset or if they are custom images created for the study.

In **section 4.1 (Training Data)**, the authors specify that they used three images for training: an aerial image, an ortho image, and a Famenin Irrigated image. They also mention that they created masks for these images using the LabelMe tool. However, these images do not appear to be part of a publicly available dataset; rather, they are custom images used for the study.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any of the images or datasets mentioned have associated citations. However, since the authors created their own masks and used specific images, there may not be formal citations for these datasets.

After reviewing the paper, I conclude that the datasets used are not standard public datasets but rather specific images utilized for the study. Therefore, I will note the following:

1. **Aerial Image**: Custom image used for training, no formal citation.
2. **Ortho Image**: Custom image used for training, no formal citation.
3. **Famenin Irrigated Image**: Custom image used for training, no formal citation.

Since these images are not part of a publicly available dataset, I will document them as custom datasets used in the research without formal citations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly indicates the nature of the datasets used in the study, ensuring clarity for future reference or analysis.
