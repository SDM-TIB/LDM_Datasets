To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Membership Inference Through Adversarial Robustness" by Zhaoxi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their proposed method on three datasets: **Fashion-MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **CIFAR-100**. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the three datasets in the introduction and later in the experimental results. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, designed as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset.
2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., and Vollgraf, R. (2017). *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. ArXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

Since both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 share the same technical report citation, I will note that the original source is the same for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
