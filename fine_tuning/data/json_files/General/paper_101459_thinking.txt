To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributed Deep Learning In Open Collaborations" by Michael Diskin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the collaborative training of models, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In Section 4.1, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training the SwAV model. I will note down the details provided about this dataset.

In Section 4.2, the authors discuss the **WikiText-103 dataset** used for pretraining the ALBERT model. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset as well.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the sources of the datasets.

For the **ImageNet dataset**, the citation is:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: a large-scale hierarchical image database*. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 06 2009.

For the **WikiText-103 dataset**, the citation is:
> Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and R. Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information for each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
