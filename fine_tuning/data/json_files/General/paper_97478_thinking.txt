To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enriching Non-Autoregressive Transformer with Syntactic and Semantic Structures for Neural Machine Translation" by Ye Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **two real-world datasets (i.e., WMT14 En-De and WMT16 En-Ro)**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for more details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that they evaluate their model on the **WMT14 En-De** (English to German) and **WMT16 En-Ro** (English to Romanian) datasets. This confirms that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **background or related work sections** to see if there are any additional details about the datasets, such as their size or specific characteristics. However, in this case, the details provided in the experiments section are sufficient.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The WMT datasets are commonly referenced in the field, so I will look for their standard citations:

1. **WMT14 En-De Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

2. **WMT16 En-Ro Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bojar, O., et al. (2016). *Findings of the 2016 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the First Conference on Machine Translation, pages 131–198.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **WMT14 En-De**: A parallel corpus containing around 4.5 million sentence pairs for English to German translation.
- **WMT16 En-Ro**: A parallel corpus containing approximately 610,000 sentence pairs for English to Romanian translation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
