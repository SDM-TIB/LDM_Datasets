To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-aware Neural Style Transfer using Instance Normalization" by E. Ioannou and S. Maddock, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a deep residual convolutional network and mentions evaluation processes, which may imply the use of datasets, but does not specify any.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results)**, as this section typically contains details about the datasets used for experiments. In this case, the authors mention that they trained their algorithm on the **Microsoft COCO dataset**, which consists of 80,000 images. This is a significant dataset for image processing tasks.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In **section 4.1 (Comparison with state-of-the-art methods)**, the authors refer to several datasets used for depth estimation comparisons, including:

1. **DIW (Depth in the Wild)**: This dataset is referenced in the context of evaluating depth estimation methods.
2. **NYU Depth Dataset V2**: Another dataset mentioned for depth estimation.
3. **Make3D**: This dataset is also referenced in the context of depth estimation.
4. **Sintel**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation for depth estimation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Microsoft COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., et al. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755.

- For the **DIW dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **NYU Depth Dataset V2**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
