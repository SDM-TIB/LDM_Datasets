To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Going Further: Flatness at the Rescue of Early Stopping for Adversarial Example Transferability" by Martin Gubri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of surrogate models trained with various techniques, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention training surrogate models on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and any modifications made for the experiments.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.
2. **ImageNet**: A large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. It contains millions of images across thousands of categories.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are as follows:
- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009. URL: http://www.image-net.org/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
