To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Confidence Estimation in Deep Neural Networks via Density Modelling" by Akshayvarun Subramanya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed confidence measure on images distorted by various types of noise, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems. The authors specify that they use the LeNet-5 architecture for this dataset.

2. **ILSVRC12 Dataset**: This refers to the validation set of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, which is a large dataset used for image classification tasks. The authors mention using the VGG-16 architecture for this dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, Nov 1998.

- For the **ILSVRC12 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge." *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211–252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
