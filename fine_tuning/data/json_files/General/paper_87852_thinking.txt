To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recursive Prediction of Graph Signals with Incoming Nodes" by Arun Venkitaraman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with real-world graph signals, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe their applications. They mention two specific datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Temperature Prediction Dataset**: This dataset consists of temperature readings from 25 of the most populated cities in Sweden, collected over the period of October to December 2017. The input features are the temperature values across the cities on a given day, and the target is the temperature values after two days. The dataset contains 90 input-output pairs, with 64 used for training and the remaining for testing.

2. **Atmospheric Pollution Index Dataset**: This dataset includes daily readings of particulate density from the European Tracer Experiment (ETEX) across various cities in Europe over a period of two months (60 days). The input consists of readings from a subset of 30 cities, while the target predictions are for a different set of 30 cities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are based on publicly available data or prior studies. Therefore, I will summarize the datasets based on the information provided in the paper.

For the **Temperature Prediction Dataset**, I will note:
- Source: Data collected from 25 cities in Sweden.
- Timeframe: October to December 2017.
- Citation: Not explicitly provided, but can be referenced as "Data collected from Swedish meteorological sources."

For the **Atmospheric Pollution Index Dataset**, I will note:
- Source: European Tracer Experiment (ETEX).
- Timeframe: 60 days of daily readings.
- Citation: Not explicitly provided, but can be referenced as "Data from the ETEX project."

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that the information is clear and accessible for future reference or processing.
