To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLiMP: A Benchmark for Chinese Language Model Evaluation" by Beilei Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial information about the datasets. The abstract introduces the **CLiMP corpus**, which consists of 1,000 minimal pairs for 16 syntactic contrasts in Mandarin, indicating that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (CLiMP)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe that CLiMP is composed of 16 individual datasets, each containing 1,000 minimal pairs (MPs) that cover 9 major linguistic phenomena in Chinese. This section is crucial as it outlines the structure and purpose of the dataset.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets. For instance, **Table 1** lists the nine linguistic phenomena covered by CLiMP, which helps in understanding the scope of the dataset. Each phenomenon corresponds to a specific aspect of Chinese grammar, and the authors provide examples of acceptable and unacceptable sentences for each phenomenon.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The primary dataset is the **CLiMP corpus**, and I will ensure to include the citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the authoritative source for this dataset:

- **CLiMP Corpus**:
  > Beilei Xiang, Changbing Yang, Yu Li, Alex Warstadt, and Katharina Kann. *CLiMP: A Benchmark for Chinese Language Model Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages XX-XX, 2023. [Link to the paper if available]

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction here. I will ensure that the information is presented clearly and accurately, focusing on the CLiMP corpus as the main dataset of interest.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for CLiMP, ensuring that it includes all relevant details and the full citation for proper referencing.
