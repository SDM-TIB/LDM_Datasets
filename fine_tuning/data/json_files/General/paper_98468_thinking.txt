To extract datasets from the research paper titled "OPANAS: One-Shot Path Aggregation Network Architecture Search for Object Detection" by Tingting Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the experimental results on COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks, which suggests that these datasets are used in the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors detail their methodology and datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The authors state that they conducted experiments on the COCO dataset, which consists of 118,000 training images and 5,000 validation images. This dataset is widely used for object detection tasks.

2. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: The authors also mention using the PASCAL VOC dataset, which includes training on the union of VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 datasets, totaling 10,000 images for training and 4,900 for evaluation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, and Serge J. Belongie et al. *Microsoft COCO: common objects in context*. In ECCV, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc J. Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John M. Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. IJCV, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
