To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Any-Way Meta Learning" by Junhoo Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of meta-learning and mention the use of various datasets for evaluation. I will look for specific names of datasets in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **MiniImageNet**: A subset of ImageNet, commonly used for few-shot learning tasks. It contains 100 classes with 600 images per class.
2. **TieredImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet, which includes 608 classes and is designed for few-shot learning.
3. **Cars**: A dataset focused on fine-grained classification of car images, containing 16,185 images across 196 classes.
4. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of bird species, containing 11,788 images across 200 classes.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MiniImageNet**:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. *Advances in neural information processing systems*, 29.

- For **TieredImageNet**:
  > Ren, M., Triantafillou, E., Ravi, S., Snell, J., Swersky, K., Tenenbaum, J. B., Larochelle, H., & Zemel, R. S. (2018). Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification. *In the Sixth International Conference on Learning Representations*.

- For **Cars**:
  > Krause, J., Stark, M., Deng, J., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). 3D object representations for fine-grained categorization. *In Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision workshops*.

- For **CUB**:
  > Welinder, P., Branson, S., Mita, T., Wah, C., Schroff, F., Belongie, S., & Perona, P. (2010). Caltech-UCSD Birds 200. *Technical Report CNS-TR-2010-001, California Institute of Technology*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
