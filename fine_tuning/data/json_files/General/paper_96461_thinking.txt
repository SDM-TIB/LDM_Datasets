To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Encoding the latent posterior of Bayesian Neural Networks for uncertainty quantification" by Gianni Franchi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors likely describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Dataset" or "Experimental Setup."

In **section 5.2 (Image classification with CIFAR-10/100)**, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets. They describe the CIFAR-10 dataset as consisting of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 dataset as having 100 classes. This section provides details about the training and evaluation protocols, confirming that these datasets are used for their experiments.

In **section 5.3 (Semantic segmentation)**, the authors mention two datasets: **StreetHazards** and **BDD-Anomaly**. The StreetHazards dataset consists of 5,125 training images and 1,500 test images with pixel-wise annotations for 13 classes. The BDD-Anomaly dataset is a subset of the BDD100K dataset, containing 6,688 training images and 361 test images with pixel-level annotations for 17 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

3. **StreetHazards**:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Steven Basart, Mantas Mazeika, Mohammadreza Mostajabi, Jacob Steinhardt, and Dawn Song. *A benchmark for anomaly segmentation*. In arXiv, 2019.

4. **BDD-Anomaly**:
   > Fisher Yu, Haofeng Chen, Xin Wang, Wenqi Xian, Yingying Chen, Fangchen Liu, Vashisht Madhavan, and Trevor Darrell. *BDD100K: A diverse driving dataset for heterogeneous multitask learning*. In CVPR, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
