To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Robust Vision Transformer" by Xiaofeng Mao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results demonstrate the performance of the Robust Vision Transformer (RVT) on **ImageNet** and six robustness benchmarks. This indicates that datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 6), where the authors describe their evaluation benchmarks. They specifically mention using **ImageNet-1K** for training and standard performance evaluation. This is a significant dataset in the field of computer vision.

Additionally, the authors refer to several robustness benchmarks:
1. **ImageNet-C**: This dataset benchmarks the model against image corruption.
2. **ImageNet-R**: This dataset contains images with naturally occurring distribution changes.
3. **ImageNet-Sketch**: This dataset consists of sketch images, which tests the model's classification ability when texture or color information is missing.
4. **ImageNet-A**: This dataset is used for evaluating the model under natural adversarial examples.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

- For **ImageNet-C**:
  > Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Dietterich. *Benchmarking neural network robustness to common corruptions and perturbations*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

- For **ImageNet-R**:
  > Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Zhao, Steven Basart, Jacob Steinhardt, and Dawn Song. *Natural adversarial examples*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.07174, 2019.

- For **ImageNet-Sketch**:
  > Haohan Wang, Songwei Ge, Eric P Xing, and Zachary C Lipton. *Learning robust global representations by penalizing local predictive power*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
