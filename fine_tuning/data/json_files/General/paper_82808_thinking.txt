To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Pseudo Healthy Synthesis Needs Pathology Factorization" by Tian Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **ISLES** and **BraTS** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of pseudo healthy synthesis and mentions the importance of having paired and unpaired data, but it does not provide additional dataset information.

I will then focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Experimental settings)**, they explicitly mention using the **ISLES 2015 dataset** and the **BraTS 2018 dataset** for their experiments. They provide some details about the datasets, such as the number of volumes and preprocessing steps, which are important for understanding the context in which these datasets are used.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **ISLES 2015 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Oskar Maier et al. "ISLES 2015 - A public evaluation benchmark for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from multi-spectral MRI." *Medical Image Analysis*, 35:250–269, 2017. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2016.07.009.

2. **BraTS 2018 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > B. H. Menze et al. "The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 34(10):1993–2024, 2015. doi: 10.1109/TMI.2014.2377694.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ISLES 2015 Dataset**: Used for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation, consisting of 28 volumes of skull-stripped MRI images.
- **BraTS 2018 Dataset**: Contains MRI scans of glioblastoma, with 79 volumes that are also skull-stripped and include segmentation masks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for further use or analysis.
