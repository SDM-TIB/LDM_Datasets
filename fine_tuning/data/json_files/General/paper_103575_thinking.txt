To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MSGDD-cGAN: Multi-Scale Gradients Dual Discriminator Conditional Generative Adversarial Network" by Mohammadreza Naderi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on fetal ultrasound images, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about their implementation. They mention using the **HC18 dataset**, which is described as a collection of fetal head ultrasound images containing 999 images with a resolution of 840Ã—500. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **implementation details** section to confirm the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of images used for training, validation, and testing. The authors specify that the training set consists of 699 images, the validation set has 100 images, and the test set contains 200 images. This information is important for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the HC18 dataset. The paper provides a DOI link for the dataset, which is:
> HC18 dataset. *http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1322001*.

This DOI link serves as the authoritative citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all relevant details for downstream processing.
