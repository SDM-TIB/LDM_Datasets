To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Presentation Attack Detection with Advanced CNN Models for Noncontact-based Fingerprint Systems" by Sandip Purnapatra et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) dataset, which suggests that there are specific datasets being utilized or created in this research.

Next, I will look closely at **section III (Dataset and Image Processing)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, the authors mention the construction of a PAD dataset consisting of over 7500 four-finger images and more than 14,000 segmented single-fingertip images, along with 10,000 synthetic fingertips. This section provides a clear overview of the dataset's composition and the methods used for data collection.

I will also examine the subsections under section III, particularly the **Presentation Attack Instrument Generation** subsection, which describes the various types of Presentation Attack Instruments (PAIs) used to create the dataset. The authors detail five different types of materials used for PAIs, including Ecoflex, Playdoh, Wood glue, Synthetic fingertips, and Latex, along with the number of images collected for each type.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The authors mention that the dataset will be publicly available by April 2023, which is important for potential users of the dataset.

The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
