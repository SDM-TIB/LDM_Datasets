To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive Comparison of Pre-training Language Models" by Tong Guo, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the exploration of various pre-trained language models but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look deeper into the introduction and experiments sections.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the need for a fair comparison of transformer-based models, hinting at the use of specific datasets for pre-training and evaluation. However, no specific datasets are named here.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely. The author mentions a pre-training dataset size of **600,000,000 Chinese sentences** and a downstream fine-tuning text classification dataset size of **2,000,000 Chinese sentences**. However, the specific names of these datasets are not provided in the text.

I will also check the **related work section** and **references** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly or if any of the referenced works provide datasets that are commonly used in the context of the experiments described. 

In the **references section**, I notice that the paper cites the GLUE benchmark and CLUE benchmark, which are well-known datasets in the NLP community. I will include these as they are relevant to the context of the paper.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Pre-training Dataset**: While the specific name is not provided, it is described as a large corpus of **600,000,000 Chinese sentences**. Since no formal citation is given, I will note it as an unnamed dataset.

2. **Downstream Fine-tuning Dataset**: Similarly, this is described as a dataset of **2,000,000 Chinese sentences** for text classification, but again, no specific name or citation is provided.

3. **GLUE Benchmark**: This is a well-known benchmark for evaluating NLP models. The citation is:
   > Wang A, Singh A, Michael J, et al. GLUE: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461*, 2018.

4. **CLUE Benchmark**: This is another benchmark mentioned in the paper. The citation is:
   > Xu L, Hu H, Zhang X, et al. CLUE: A Chinese language understanding evaluation benchmark. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.05986*, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing. I will ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset mentioned.
