To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Affective Social Anthropomorphic Intelligent System" by Md. Adyelullahil Mamun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset description sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the dataset details are likely found in the **dataset description section**.

In **section 3 (Dataset description)**, the authors explicitly list several datasets used in their research. I will carefully note each dataset's name, description, and any relevant details provided.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **RAVDESS**: The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song, which consists of 1440 audio files of emotional speech recorded by professional actors. The dataset includes various emotional expressions.

2. **SAVEE**: The Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion dataset, which contains high-quality audio recordings of male voices expressing different emotions. It includes seven emotional categories.

3. **TESS**: The Toronto Emotional Speech Set, which consists of audio recordings of two actresses expressing various emotions through 200 target words.

4. **CREMA-D**: The Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset, which includes 7442 audio clips from actors of diverse backgrounds expressing different emotions.

5. **Indic TTS**: A dataset for building text-to-speech synthesis systems for 13 major Indian languages, including audio speeches and text transcriptions.

6. **LJ Speech**: A public domain dataset consisting of audio clips from non-fiction books, recorded by a single speaker.

7. **Libri TTS**: A large dataset totaling 585 hours of audio speeches in English, created for text-to-speech models.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted according to academic standards.

The full citations for the datasets are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
