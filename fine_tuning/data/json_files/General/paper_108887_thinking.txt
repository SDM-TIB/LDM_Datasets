To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Selective Residual M-Net for Real Image Denoising" by Chi-Mao Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on "two synthetic and two real-world noisy datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Experiment Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is used for Gaussian color image denoising. It consists of 800 high-quality images for training and 100 images for validation, with an average resolution of about 1920 × 1080. The authors note that they randomly crop patches of size 256×256 for training.

2. **CBSD68 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluation of the denoising performance at different noise levels. It contains 68 images and is referenced for quantitative comparisons.

3. **Kodak24 Dataset**: Another dataset used for evaluation, consisting of 24 images, which is also referenced for performance metrics.

4. **SIDD Dataset**: This dataset is used for real-world image denoising, containing 320 high-resolution images for training and 1280 validation patches for testing.

5. **DND Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluation in real-world image denoising, consisting of 1000 patches.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
