To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Limits of Transformer Language Models on Learning Algorithmic Compositions" by Jonathan Thomm et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of two new tasks related to algorithmic compositions, which may imply the existence of datasets used for these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Compositional Algorithmic Task Variations)**, where the authors introduce two tasks: **Pointer Executionâ€™s Neighbour (PEN)** and **Pointer Execution Reverse Multicount (PER Multi)**. I will look for any references to datasets used to create or evaluate these tasks.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors describe their experiments with LLaMA models on these tasks. I will check if they mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation. If they do, I will note down the names and descriptions of these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will search for them online or in related literature to ensure I can provide accurate references.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the citation formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
