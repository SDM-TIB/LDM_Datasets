To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stance Detection in Turkish Tweets" by Dilek Küçük, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of a stance detection tweet dataset for Turkish, which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the nature of stance detection and hints at the dataset's significance as the first of its kind for the Turkish language.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (A Stance Detection Dataset)**, where the author describes the dataset in detail. Here, I will look for specific information about the dataset, including its size, the nature of the annotations, and the targets involved. The author states that the dataset consists of 700 tweets annotated for stance towards two popular Turkish football clubs: Galatasaray and Fenerbahçe. The dataset is balanced, with 175 tweets in favor of and 175 against each target.

I will also note the URL provided for accessing the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes. The dataset is publicly available in CSV format, and the author emphasizes its significance due to the scarcity of annotated datasets for Turkish.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the author and is not a previously published dataset, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Dilek Küçük. 2017. Stance Detection in Turkish Tweets. In Proceedings of Workshop on Social Media World Sensors (SIDEWAYS), Prague, Czech Republic, July 2017 (SIDEWAYS’17), 4 pages. DOI: 10.475/123 4.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
