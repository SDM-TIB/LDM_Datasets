To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Patch Network for medical image Segmentation" by Weihu Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on several segmentation datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In section 4.1.1, the authors mention the **CVC-ClinicDB** dataset, which contains 612 colon polyp images. They specify that the images are resized to 384×288 and split into training and testing sets. 

In section 4.1.2, the **ETIS-LaribPolypDB** dataset is discussed, which consists of 196 images from 29 sequences. The authors note that these images are resized to 512×384 and also split into training and testing sets.

In section 4.1.3, the authors describe the **ISIC2018** dataset, which is used for skin lesion segmentation. This dataset contains 2,594 images, resized to 224×224, and is randomly split into training and testing sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The citations I need to extract are as follows:

1. For **CVC-ClinicDB**, the citation is:
   > Bernal J, Sánchez FJ, Fernández-Esparrach G, Gil D, de Miguel CR, Vilariño F. "Wm-dova maps for accurate polyp highlighting in colonoscopy: Validation vs. saliency maps from physicians." *Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics*, 43:99–111, 2015.

2. For **ETIS-LaribPolypDB**, the citation is:
   > Jha D, Riegler MA, Johansen D, Halvorsen P, Johansen HD. "Doubleunet: A deep convolutional neural network for medical image segmentation." In: *2020 IEEE 33rd International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems (CBMS)*, IEEE, pp 558–564, 2020.

3. For **ISIC2018**, the citation is:
   > Tschandl P, Rosendahl J, Kittler H. "The HAM10000 dataset: A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions." *Scientific Data*, 7:883, 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
