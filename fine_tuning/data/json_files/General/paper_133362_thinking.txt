To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Computational Complexity of Private High-dimensional Model Selection" by Saptarshi Roy, Zehua Wang, and Ambuj Tewari, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any explicit mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

In the paper, I will look for specific phrases like "we used the following datasets" or "the experiments were conducted on" to pinpoint where the authors discuss their datasets. 

If the paper includes tables or figures that summarize the datasets, I will carefully analyze those as well, as they may contain valuable information about the datasets used.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.

Now, I will proceed with the extraction process based on the outlined steps.
