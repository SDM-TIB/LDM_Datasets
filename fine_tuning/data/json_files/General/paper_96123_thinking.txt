To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FBWave: Efficient and Scalable Neural Vocoders for Streaming Text-to-Speech on the Edge" by Bichen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of FBWave and its performance, but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the other sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the challenges of deploying TTS systems on edge devices but do not mention specific datasets. Moving on to the **method section**, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In **section 3 (Experiments)**, the authors state that they trained FBWave using a dataset recorded in a voice production studio by a professional voice talent, which contains **40,244 utterances, approximately 40 hours of training data**. However, the specific name of this dataset is not provided. This indicates that while a dataset is used, it is not publicly available or named in the paper.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily list previous works and models related to TTS and vocoders, but do not provide a specific dataset citation for the one used in this study.

Since the paper does not provide a formal name or citation for the dataset used, I will note that the dataset is described as a proprietary dataset recorded in a studio, but lacks a formal citation. 

In summary, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Unnamed Dataset**: A dataset recorded in a voice production studio containing 40,244 utterances, approximately 40 hours of training data. No formal citation is available.

Since there are no formal citations for the datasets mentioned in this paper, I will conclude that the extraction process has yielded limited results regarding named datasets. I will compile the findings into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
