To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "BERT-Flow-VAE: A Weakly-supervised Model for Multi-Label Text Classification" by Ziwen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the model was evaluated on **6 multi-label datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **Restaurant Dataset**: This dataset is part of the SemEval 2014 Task 4 and is commonly used for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
2. **Laptop Dataset**: Also from the SemEval 2014 Task 4, this dataset is similar in nature to the Restaurant dataset.
3. **CitySearch Dataset**: This dataset is used for sentiment analysis and was introduced by Ganu et al. in 2009.
4. **SentiHood Dataset**: A dataset created for targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis, introduced by Saeidi et al. in 2016.
5. **Reuters Dataset**: Specifically, the Apt’e Mod version from 1994, which contains financial news articles.
6. **Heritage Dataset**: A self-made dataset consisting of online reviews for heritage sites, containing 3,760 reviews across 9 categories.

I will then verify the details of each dataset, including the number of samples and classes, as well as any relevant statistics provided in the paper.

After gathering the dataset names and their descriptions, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations I need to locate are:

- For the **Restaurant Dataset** and **Laptop Dataset**:

- For the **Heritage Dataset**, since it is self-made, I will note that it does not have a formal citation but will describe it as created by the authors of the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
