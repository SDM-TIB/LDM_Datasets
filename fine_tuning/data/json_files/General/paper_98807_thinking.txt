To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Global Correlation Network: End-to-End Joint Multi-Object Detection and Tracking" by Xuewu Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method on a multi-vehicle tracking dataset called **UA-DETRAC**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this case, the authors explicitly state that they conducted their experiments on the **UA-DETRAC** dataset, which is a key dataset for their evaluation.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the dataset, including that it contains 100 sequences, with 60 used for training and the rest for testing. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and purpose.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **UA-DETRAC** dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Longyin Wen, Dawei Du, Zhaowei Cai, Zhen Lei, Ming Ching Chang, Honggang Qi, Jongwoo Lim, Ming Hsuan Yang, and Siwei Lyu. *UA-DETRAC: A new benchmark and protocol for multi-object detection and tracking*. 2015.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for any further processing or review.
