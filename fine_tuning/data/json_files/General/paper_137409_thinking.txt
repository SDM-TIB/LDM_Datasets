To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fall Detection Event Using Multisensor Data" by Tresor Y. Koffi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a "multisensor dataset," which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **UP-Fall dataset**. This section provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its purpose and the types of data it contains. The UP-Fall dataset is noted to be designed for fall detection and includes various activities and trials, which is crucial for understanding its application in the study.

In this section, the authors describe the dataset as comprising 11 distinct activities and six activities of daily living (ADLs), with each activity performed multiple times. They also mention the types of sensors used to collect data, which adds context to the dataset's richness.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UP-Fall dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **UP-Fall Dataset**: 
  > L. Martínez-Villaseñor, H. Ponce, J. Brieva, E. Moya-Albor, J. Núñez-Martínez, and C. Peñafort-Asturiano. *UP-Fall Detection Dataset: A Multimodal Approach*. Sensors, vol. 19, no. 9, p. 1988, 2019.

Since the UP-Fall dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately captured and formatted correctly.
