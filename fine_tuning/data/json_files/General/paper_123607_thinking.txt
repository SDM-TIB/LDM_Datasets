To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "The challenge of representation learning: Improved accuracy in deep vision models does not come with better predictions of perceptual similarity" by Fritz Günther et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the study's focus on representation learning and perceptual similarity, but I need to look for specific datasets in the later sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of evaluating computer vision models against behavioral datasets, which suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their study. They describe several datasets related to image similarity and processing time data:

1. **IMG Dataset**: This dataset contains ratings of image similarity for 3,000 pairs of naturalistic ImageNet images, collected from 480 participants with 30 observations per image pair.

2. **WORD Dataset**: This dataset includes visual word similarity ratings for 3,000 word pairs (image labels of the aforementioned 3,000 image pairs), also collected from 480 participants with 30 observations per word pair.

3. **TYP Dataset**: This dataset consists of typicality ratings for 7,500 word-image pairs, where participants indicated the most and least typical images for given labels. Data were collected from 902 participants with 30 observations per word-image pair.

4. **DIS Dataset**: This dataset involves processing time data from a discrimination task for the same 3,000 image pairs as the IMG dataset, collected from 750 participants with 30 observations per image pair.

5. **PRIM Dataset**: This dataset also involves processing time data for the same 3,000 image pairs, collected from 750 participants with 30 observations per image pair.

The authors mention that all datasets are publicly available in an OSF repository associated with the original study, which is a crucial detail for citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference a previous study by Günther et al. (2022) that provides detailed descriptions of the datasets. The citation for this study is:

- **Günther, F., Marelli, M., & Petilli, M. A. (2022). Vispa (vision spaces): A computer-vision-based representation system for individual images and concept prototypes, with large-scale evaluation. Psychological Review, Advance online publication.** 

Since the datasets are derived from this study, I will use this citation for all datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
