To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Alioth: A Machine Learning Based Interference-Aware Performance Monitor for Multi-Tenancy Applications in Public Cloud" by Tianyao Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset called **Alioth-dataset** through co-location experiments, which is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **Alioth-dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe how they built this dataset through comprehensive co-location experiments on a testbed, which reflects real-world scenarios. They mention that the dataset consists of around **46,000 data samples**, each containing low-level metrics, performance metrics, and additional labels describing the application and workload intensity.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they used the **Alioth-dataset** to evaluate their machine learning framework, which further emphasizes its importance in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is created by the authors themselves and is made publicly available on GitHub, I will cite it as follows:

- **Alioth-dataset**: 
  > Tianyao Shi, Yingxuan Yang, Yunlong Cheng, Xiaofeng Gao, Zhen Fang, Yongqiang Yang. *Alioth: A Machine Learning Based Interference-Aware Performance Monitor for Multi-Tenancy Applications in Public Cloud*. Available at: https://github.com/StHowling/Alioth.

Since the dataset is not published in a traditional format (like a journal article), the citation reflects its availability on GitHub.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for **Alioth-dataset** based on the information gathered, ensuring that the citation is included as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the dataset while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
