To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modified U-Net (mU-Net) with Incorporation of Object-Dependent High Level Features for Improved Liver and Liver-Tumor Segmentation in CT Images" by Hyunseok Seo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a public dataset for liver tumor segmentation (LiTS) and also references another dataset (3Dircadb) for validation. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methods section**. In the subsection titled **D. Image dataset and data preparation**, the authors provide detailed information about the datasets:

1. **Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS)**: This dataset consists of 130 abdomen contrast CT scans. It specifies the input size, in-plane resolution, number of slices, and how the data is divided into training, validation, and test sets. The authors mention that 22,500 images were used for training, 2,550 for validation, and 16,125 for testing.

2. **3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3Dircadb)**: This dataset is also described in the methods section, detailing the input size, in-plane resolution, number of slices, and how the data is split for training and testing. It mentions that 2,295 images were used for training and 525 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper provides URLs for both datasets in the Data Availability section, which can be used to access the datasets directly:

- For **LiTS**, the URL is: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094
- For **3Dircadb**, the URL is: https://www.ircad.fr/research/3dircadb/

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset:

- **LiTS Dataset**:
  > Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS). Available at: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094

- **3Dircadb Dataset**:
  > 3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database (3Dircadb). Available at: https://www.ircad.fr/research/3dircadb/

Finally, I will summarize the extracted datasets, ensuring that I have captured all relevant details and citations accurately for further processing or review.
