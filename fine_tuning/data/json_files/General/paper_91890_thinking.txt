To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wasserstein Distance guided Adversarial Imitation Learning with Reward Shape Exploration" by Ming Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their research. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MuJoCo** physics engine for their experiments, which indicates that they are likely using datasets related to continuous control tasks. I will check if they provide specific datasets or benchmarks related to MuJoCo.

I will also look for any **figures or tables** that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context about their characteristics. This could include information about the number of trajectories, state-action pairs, or other relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset from the MuJoCo environment, I will look for the original source or paper that describes that dataset. If they refer to a benchmark or a well-known dataset, I will ensure to capture the correct citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for any further processing or review.
