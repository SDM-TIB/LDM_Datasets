To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GEOFORMER: A VISION AND SEQUENCE TRANSFORMER-BASED APPROACH FOR GREENHOUSE GAS MONITORING" by Madhav Khirwar and Ankur Narang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a dataset using Sentinel-5P images and corresponding NO2 concentration readings, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the need for detailed insight into the spatial and temporal distribution of NO2, which further emphasizes the importance of the dataset they created. They specifically state that they introduce a comprehensive dataset that pairs high-resolution Sentinel-5P satellite imagery with corresponding surface-level NO2 concentration measurements, characterized by daily granularity over 15 months.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details about how the dataset was constructed. The authors describe the data collection process, including temporal alignment of satellite images with ground-level NO2 data, spatial coverage around monitoring stations, and image processing steps. This provides a clear understanding of the dataset's structure and the data collection methodology.

In the **experimentation section**, the authors mention that they collected ground-level NO2 concentration data from 35 monitoring stations across Europe, which further confirms the dataset's scope and relevance.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference a previous work by Scheibenreif et al. (2021) that discusses the estimation of air pollution with remote sensing data. This is relevant because it provides context for the dataset they constructed.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
- For the dataset constructed using Sentinel-5P images and NO2 concentration readings, the citation is:
  > Linus Scheibenreif, Michael Mommert, and Damian Borth. *Estimation of air pollution with remote sensing data: Revealing greenhouse gas emissions from space*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.13902, 2021.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **Dataset Name**: Paired Sentinel-5P and NO2 Data
   - **Description**: A comprehensive dataset that pairs high-resolution Sentinel-5P satellite imagery with corresponding surface-level NO2 concentration measurements, characterized by daily granularity over 15 months.
   - **Source**: Ground-level NO2 concentration data collected from 35 monitoring stations across Europe, with corresponding Sentinel-5P satellite images.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
