To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Intelligence-Driven Classification of Cancer Patients-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy: Results from a Pilot Study," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves **24 blood samples-derived EVs** from **15 cancer patients** and **9 healthy controls**, which suggests that these samples are part of the dataset.

Next, I will look for specific details about the datasets in the **methods section**, particularly in the subsections that describe the **blood collection and serum preparation** and **extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolation**. Here, I find that the study involves blood samples from patients with various types of cancers and healthy controls, which provides a clear description of the dataset composition.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of machine learning classifiers on the **FCS power spectra** derived from these samples. This reinforces that the dataset consists of the processed power spectra from the **N=118 power spectra** obtained from the **n=24 patient samples**.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. The key datasets identified are:

1. **Blood Samples from Cancer Patients and Healthy Controls**: This dataset includes samples from **15 cancer patients** with **5 different types of cancers** and **9 healthy controls**. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is original data collected by the authors.

2. **FCS Power Spectra Dataset**: The processed power spectra derived from the **24 blood samples**. Again, this dataset is original and does not have a formal citation.

Since the datasets are original and do not have external citations, I will note that they are part of the study's findings and provide a description of their composition.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to highlight their significance in the context of the research findings. This will include the number of samples, types of patients, and the methods used for data collection and analysis.
