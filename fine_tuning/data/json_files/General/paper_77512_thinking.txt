To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reachable Set Computation and Safety Verification for Neural Networks with ReLU Activations" by Weiming Xiang, Hoang-Dung Tran, and Taylor T. Johnson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or examples.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the research.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any numerical examples or case studies presented, as they often include specific datasets or synthetic data generated for the purpose of the study.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Multi-Parametric Toolbox," I will look for its citation in the references. If it is not explicitly cited, I will note that it is a tool used for computations rather than a dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted datasets are accurately represented and that their citations are complete, as this is essential for academic integrity and for readers who may wish to explore the datasets further.
