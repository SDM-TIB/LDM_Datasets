To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An unsupervised learning approach to solving heat equations on chip based on Auto Encoder and Image Gradient" by Haiyang He and Jay Pathak, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a hybrid framework for solving heat equations, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1.2 (Data generation and training of AE using artificial power maps)**, where the authors describe the creation of datasets for training the Auto Encoder (AE). They mention generating different distributions of artificial power maps, including sinusoidal and exponential power maps, as well as variations of a realistic power map. This indicates that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

In this section, the authors state that they created **25 distinct sinusoidal power maps** and **25 exponential power maps**. They also mention using **41 artificial power maps** generated through image augmentation techniques based on a realistic power map obtained from ANSYS RedHawk. This gives me a clear indication of the datasets involved.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the datasets are generated by the authors themselves and do not refer to external datasets, I will note that the citations for the datasets will be based on the paper itself.

The datasets can be summarized as follows:

1. **Sinusoidal Power Maps**: 25 distinct power maps defined by the equation provided in the paper.
2. **Exponential Power Maps**: 25 distinct power maps defined by the exponential equation provided in the paper.
3. **Variations of a Realistic Power Map**: 41 artificial power maps created through image augmentation techniques based on a realistic power map from ANSYS RedHawk.

Since these datasets are not published externally, I will cite the paper itself as the source for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper as the source for all datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Haiyang He and Jay Pathak. *An unsupervised learning approach to solving heat equations on chip based on Auto Encoder and Image Gradient*. July 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
