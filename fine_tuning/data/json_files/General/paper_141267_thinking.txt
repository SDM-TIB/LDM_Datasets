To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effect of Seaweed, Moringa Leaf Extract and Biofertilizer on Growth, Yield and Fruit Quality of Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) Under Greenhouse Condition" by Roshna Faeq Kakbra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract typically provides a summary of the study's findings, which may include references to specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the author describes the experimental design and treatments applied. This section often includes details about the datasets, such as the types of biostimulants used (e.g., seaweed extracts, moringa leaf extract, and Fulzym-plus) and how they were applied to the cucumber plants.

In the **results section**, I will look for tables or figures that present quantitative data related to the growth, yield, and fruit quality of cucumbers. This section is crucial as it often contains the actual datasets that were analyzed, including measurements like plant height, number of fruits, fruit weight, and nutrient concentrations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **discussion section** for any additional context or insights regarding the datasets. The authors may discuss the implications of the data, compare it with previous studies, or highlight significant findings that could be relevant for understanding the datasets.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or studies referenced in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the original sources of the data.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
