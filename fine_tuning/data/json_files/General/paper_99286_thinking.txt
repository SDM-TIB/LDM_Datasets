To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Online Feature Screening for Data Streams with Concept Drift" by Mingyuan Wang and Adrian Barbu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the research focuses on classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant sections that might describe the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, there is a **Table 1** in the **Evaluation of Proposed Methods** section that lists several datasets used for evaluating the online/offline screening methods. This table is crucial as it provides the names and characteristics of the datasets.

The datasets mentioned in Table 1 are:

1. **Gisette**: A classification dataset with 5,000 observations and 5,000 features.
2. **Dexter**: A classification dataset with 2,000 observations and 20,000 features.
3. **Madelon**: A classification dataset with 2,000 observations and 500 features.
4. **SMK CAN 187**: A classification dataset with 2,000 observations and 22,283 features.
5. **GLI 85**: A classification dataset with 85 observations and 1,150 features.
6. **Dorothea**: A classification dataset with 1,000 observations and 100,000 features.
7. **Url**: A classification dataset with 2 million observations and 11,862 features.
8. **Kdd12**: A classification dataset with 16,000 observations and 7,000 features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided for datasets that are publicly available or widely recognized in the research community.

After reviewing the references, I find the following citations:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and completeness in the extraction process.
