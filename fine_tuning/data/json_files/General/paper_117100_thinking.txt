To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-CLS BERT: An Efficient Alternative to Traditional Ensembling" by Haw-Shiuan Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on **GLUE** and **SuperGLUE**, which indicates that these benchmarks are likely datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in detail, and I will focus on identifying any specific datasets they used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly mention using the following datasets:

1. **GLUE**: A multi-task benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding systems. The authors reference the original GLUE paper for citation.
2. **SuperGLUE**: An advanced benchmark that builds upon GLUE, also referenced in the paper.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **GLUE**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In 7th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2019, New Orleans, LA, USA, May 6-9, 2019.

- For **SuperGLUE**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Yada Pruksachatkun, Nikita Nangia, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *SuperGLUE: A Stickier Benchmark for General-Purpose Language Understanding Systems*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2019, NeurIPS 2019, December 8-14, 2019, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.
