To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arbitrary-Scale Video Super-Resolution with Structural and Textural Priors" by Wei Shang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted comprehensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this section, they explicitly mention the datasets they utilized. 

Upon reviewing Section 4.1 (Experimental Setups), I find that the authors trained their model on the **REDS dataset** and tested it on the **Vid4 dataset**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset:

1. **REDS Dataset**: The paper states that it comprises 240 videos of resolution 720 Ã— 1,280 captured by GoPro, with each video containing 100 high-resolution frames.

2. **Vid4 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 4 videos, but the paper does not provide specific details about the resolution or content.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **REDS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nah, S., Baik, S., Hong, S., Moon, G., Son, S., Timofte, R., & Mu Lee, K. (2019). NTIRE 2019 challenge on video deblurring and super-resolution: Dataset and study. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 0-0.

- For the **Vid4 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, C., & Sun, D. (2013). On bayesian adaptive video super resolution. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 36(2), 346-360.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
