To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Expressivity of Neural Networks for Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Kefan Dong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and prior work, which may include dataset references.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors are likely to describe the datasets used for empirical validation. I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the experiments section, I will identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to benchmark datasets or specific environments used for testing their algorithms, I will note these down. I will also check if there are any figures or tables that summarize the datasets used.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For instance, if the paper mentions using the **MuJoCo benchmark tasks**, I will look for the original source of this dataset. The citation for the MuJoCo simulator is:
> Emanuel Todorov, Tom Erez, and Yuval Tassa. *MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control*. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, pp. 5026â€“5033. IEEE, 2012.

If the paper also references other datasets, such as specific reinforcement learning environments or benchmarks, I will extract their names and corresponding citations in a similar manner.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.
