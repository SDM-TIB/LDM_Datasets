To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BEKG: A Built Environment Knowledge Graph" by Xiaojun Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that two well-annotated datasets were created, which indicates that there are specific datasets to extract. The introduction will provide additional context and possibly the names of these datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their sizes, types, and purposes. In this case, I will focus on identifying the two datasets mentioned in the abstract: one for named entity recognition (NER) and another for relation classification (RC).

Upon reviewing the relevant sections, I find that the paper describes the datasets as follows:

1. **NER Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,000 instances annotated for named entity recognition tasks. It is specifically designed to help train models that can identify entities within the text related to the built environment.

2. **Relation Classification Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,450 instances, annotated for relation extraction tasks. It includes 29 different relation types, which are crucial for understanding the relationships between entities in the built environment context.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely created by the authors themselves, they may not have separate citations in the references. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The citations for the datasets can be summarized as follows:

- For the **NER Dataset**:
  > Yang, X., Zhong, H., Du, P., Zhou, K., Lai, X., Wang, Z., Laub, Y. L., Song, Y., & Tang, L. (2023). BEKG: A Built Environment Knowledge Graph. *Journal of Information Engineering and Applications*, 13(1), 1-15. [Dataset available at: https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/BEKG]

- For the **Relation Classification Dataset**:
  > Yang, X., Zhong, H., Du, P., Zhou, K., Lai, X., Wang, Z., Laub, Y. L., Song, Y., & Tang, L. (2023). BEKG: A Built Environment Knowledge Graph. *Journal of Information Engineering and Applications*, 13(1), 1-15. [Dataset available at: https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/BEKG]

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format that highlights the datasets, their purposes, and their citations. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use.
