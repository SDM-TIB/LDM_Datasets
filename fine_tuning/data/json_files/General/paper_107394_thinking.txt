To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MCXAI: LOCAL MODEL-AGNOSTIC EXPLANATION AS TWO GAMES" by Yiran Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for experiments. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments. They describe it as a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of handwritten digits.

In Section 4.2, the authors refer to the **dog-cats dataset** from Kaggle, which is used to evaluate the performance of their model. This dataset consists of images of cats and dogs, and the authors detail how they split it into training and testing sets.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 2010. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **dog-cats dataset**, the citation is:
   > Kaggle. *Dogs vs. Cats*. URL: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset of handwritten digits used for image classification tasks, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 training and 10,000 testing).
- **Dog-Cats Dataset**: A dataset containing images of cats and dogs, used for binary classification tasks, with 2,500 training images and 500 test images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
