To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning-Based Safe Motion Control of Vehicle Ski-Stunt Maneuvers" by Feng Han and Jingang Yi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. I will look for any mentions of datasets or experimental data that the authors used to validate their methods.

Next, I will carefully review the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific features that are relevant to the study. I will pay attention to any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or provide additional context.

In this paper, the authors mention conducting **numerical simulations** and **preliminary experiments**. I will look for specific datasets related to these experiments, such as the parameters used for the scaled RC truck and any data collected during the experiments. 

I will also check the **results** section for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared against the proposed methods. This section may provide insights into how the datasets were utilized in the context of the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets if needed.

For example, if the authors used a specific dataset for training their Gaussian process model or for validating their control methods, I will ensure to note the dataset's name and its citation. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions, including their names, characteristics, and full citations, ensuring that I follow the required format for clarity and consistency.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets effectively from the research paper, ensuring that I include all relevant details and citations.
