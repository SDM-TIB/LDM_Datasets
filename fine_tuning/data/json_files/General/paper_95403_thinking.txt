To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unmasking Contextual Stereotypes: Measuring and Mitigating BERTâ€™s Gender Bias" by Marion Bartl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors measure gender bias using various corpora, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors mention the creation of the **Bias Evaluation Corpus with Professions (BEC-Pro)**, which is a new dataset they developed for measuring gender bias. They also reference two existing datasets:

1. **Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)**: This dataset was developed by Kiritchenko and Mohammad (2018) and is used for testing gender and racial bias in NLP systems. It contains 8,640 sentences constructed using specific templates.

2. **GAP Corpus**: Developed by Webster et al. (2018), this dataset contains 8,908 ambiguous pronoun-name pairs in various contexts, specifically designed for measuring gender bias in coreference resolution systems.

I will also look for any additional mentions of datasets in the **methodology and results sections** to confirm their usage and relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC)**:
  > Kiritchenko, S., & Mohammad, S. M. (2018). Examining gender and race bias in two hundred sentiment analysis systems. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.04508.

- For the **GAP Corpus**:
  > Webster, K., Recasens, M., Axelrod, V., & Baldridge, J. (2018). Mind the gap: A balanced corpus of gendered ambiguous pronouns. In Transactions of the ACL.

- For the **Bias Evaluation Corpus with Professions (BEC-Pro)**, since it is a new dataset created by the authors, I will cite it as follows:
  > Bartl, M., Nissim, M., & Gatt, A. (2023). Bias Evaluation Corpus with Professions (BEC-Pro). Available at: https://github.com/marionbartl/gender-bias-BERT.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
