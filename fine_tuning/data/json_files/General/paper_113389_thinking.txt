To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HE-PEx: Efficient Machine Learning under Homomorphic Encryption using Pruning, Permutation and Expansion" by Ehud Aharoni et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their methods on various autoencoder architectures, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training their models. In this section, they state that they trained their networks on the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher JC Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper primarily discusses the MNIST dataset for their experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
