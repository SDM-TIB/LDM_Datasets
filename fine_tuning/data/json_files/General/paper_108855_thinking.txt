To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DCTN: 3D Convolution-Transformer Network for Point Cloud Classification" by Dening Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on the **ModelNet40** dataset. This indicates that a dataset is indeed being used, and I need to gather more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors highlight the importance of 3D point cloud classification and reference the **ModelNet40** dataset as a public dataset used for evaluation. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the **ModelNet40** dataset, stating that it consists of 12,311 CAD-like models across 40 object categories, with a specific split of 9,843 training models and 2,468 testing models. They also mention that each model is downsampled to 1,024 points with normals for input into their network.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **ModelNet40** dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). 3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 1912â€“1920.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **ModelNet40** dataset, I will create an entry for it, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
