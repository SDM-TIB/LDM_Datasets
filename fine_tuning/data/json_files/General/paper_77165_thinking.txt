To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Neural Audio Synthesis" by Nal Kalchbrenner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses techniques for audio synthesis but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction states that the authors benchmark their models on a **single-speaker North-American English text-to-speech dataset**, which indicates that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **Experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors mention that their models were trained on a dataset of **44 hours of North American English speech recorded by a professional speaker**. This is a crucial detail, as it specifies the dataset used for their evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors reference the dataset as being used in conjunction with the work of van den Oord et al. (2017). I will locate this reference to provide the complete citation.

The citation for the dataset is:
> van den Oord, A., Dieleman, S., Zen, H., Simonyan, K., Vinyals, O., Graves, A., Kalchbrenner, N., Senior, A., and Kavukcuoglu, K. *WaveNet: A generative model for raw audio*. CoRR, abs/1609.03499, 2016a.

This citation refers to the original work that introduced the dataset used for training the models in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information about the dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This will allow for easy reference and further exploration of the dataset in future research or applications.
