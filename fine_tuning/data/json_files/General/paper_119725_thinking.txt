To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EURO: ESPNET UNSUPERVISED ASR OPEN-SOURCE TOOLKIT" by Dongji Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the toolkit has been evaluated on "TIMIT and LibriSpeech datasets," which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets:

1. **TIMIT Dataset**: The authors describe it as a popular benchmark for unsupervised automatic speech recognition (UASR), containing 6,300 sentences (5.4 hours) of reading speech, with all sentences manually transcribed to phonemes. They mention the standard split of the dataset into training, development, and test sets.

2. **LibriSpeech Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a common benchmark for automatic speech recognition (ASR), containing 960 hours of reading speech derived from audiobooks. The authors detail the splits into training, development, and test sets.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to obtain the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **TIMIT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > JS Garofolo, LF Lamel, WM Fisher, et al. *Timit Acoustic-Phonetic Continuous Speech Corpus LDC93S1*. Linguistic Data Consortium, 1993.

- For the **LibriSpeech Dataset**, the citation is:
  > V. Panayotov, G. Chen, D. Povey, et al. *Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
