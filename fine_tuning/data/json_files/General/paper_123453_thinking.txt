To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Weakly Supervised Caveline Detection For AUV Navigation Inside Underwater Caves" by Boxiao Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract highlights the challenges of mapping underwater caves and mentions the use of a weakly supervised learning approach, which suggests that datasets are involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly looking for any explicit mentions of datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention conducting experiments in three different cave locations: Florida, Mexico, and Spain. This indicates that there are at least three datasets associated with these locations.

In the **data preparation section**, the authors explicitly state that they compiled data into three sets based on the cave systems they explored. They refer to these datasets as the **Florida dataset**, **Mexico dataset**, and **Spain dataset**. Each dataset consists of images collected from the respective locations, with specific characteristics mentioned for each.

Now, I will gather the details for each dataset:

1. **Florida Dataset**: This dataset contains images of thin, off-white colored cavelines collected from the Devil’s system in Florida, USA. The authors mention that they prepared 1050 images for this dataset.

2. **Mexico Dataset**: This dataset includes images of thick yellow cavelines from the Dos Ojos Cenote in Quintana Roo, Mexico, also containing 1050 images.

3. **Spain Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of thick orange cavelines from Cueva del Agua in Murcia, Spain, with a total of 1050 images as well.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for these datasets, as they are likely original datasets created by the authors for their experiments. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are original contributions of the authors.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Florida Dataset**: Images of thin, off-white cavelines from the Devil’s system in Florida, USA. Total of 1050 images.
- **Mexico Dataset**: Images of thick yellow cavelines from the Dos Ojos Cenote in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Total of 1050 images.
- **Spain Dataset**: Images of thick orange cavelines from Cueva del Agua in Murcia, Spain. Total of 1050 images.

Since these datasets are original and do not have external citations, I will note that they are part of the authors' contributions.

After compiling this information, I will prepare to format it according to the required structure for downstream processing.
