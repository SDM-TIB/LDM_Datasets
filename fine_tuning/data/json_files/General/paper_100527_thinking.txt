To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoLRS: Automatic Learning-Rate Schedule by Bayesian Optimization on the Fly" by Yuchen Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any sections specifically labeled as "Datasets" or similar headings. In this paper, the authors mention applying their method to train three representative DNNs: **ResNet-50**, **Transformer**, and **BERT**. I will check if they specify the datasets used for training these models.

In the experiments section, the authors mention that they trained **ResNet-50** on **ImageNet**, **Transformer** on the **WMT 2014 English-German dataset**, and **BERT** on the **English Wikipedia and the BooksCorpus dataset**. I will note these datasets down as they are crucial for understanding the context of the experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211–252, 2015.

2. **WMT 2014 English-German dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. *Attention is all you need*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pp. 5998–6008, 2017.

3. **BooksCorpus dataset**: The citation for the BooksCorpus dataset is:
   > Yukun Zhu, Ryan Kiros, Rich Zemel, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Raquel Urtasun, Antonio Torralba, and Sanja Fidler. *Aligning books and movies: Towards story-like visual explanations by watching movies and reading books*. In Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), ICCV ’15, pp. 19–27, USA, 2015. IEEE Computer Society.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
