To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Penalized Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Constrained Sampling" by Mert Gürbüzbalaban, Yuanhan Hu, and Lingjiong Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. This section often includes information about the datasets used, such as their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, especially in the context of experiments or evaluations.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to datasets used in the context of Bayesian learning problems, as the authors mention illustrating their algorithms on Bayesian LASSO regression and Bayesian constrained deep learning problems. This could indicate the use of specific datasets related to these applications.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Diabetes dataset," I will look for the full citation in the references, which might include details such as the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

Finally, I will ensure that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset as found in the references.

This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper citations for each.
