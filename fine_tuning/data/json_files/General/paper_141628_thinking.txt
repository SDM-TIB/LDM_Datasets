To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BCAmirs at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Beyond Words: A Multimodal and Multilingual Exploration of Persuasion in Memes" by Amirhossein Abaskohi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their participation in the SemEval-2024 shared task, which involves detecting rhetorical and psychological techniques in memes. They mention that the training set for all subtasks contains only English memes, while the test datasets include memes in three low-resource languages (Arabic, Bulgarian, and North Macedonian). This indicates that there are datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the methodology. In this paper, the authors refer to the **MemeCap dataset** used for fine-tuning their models for meme captioning. They also mention the **Persuasion dataset**, which is likely the dataset used for the classification tasks in the SemEval-2024 shared task.

Now, I will gather full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **MemeCap Dataset**: The citation is:
   > EunJeong Hwang and Vered Shwartz. *MemeCap: A dataset for captioning and interpreting memes*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1433â€“1445, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Persuasion Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Dimitar Dimitrov, Firoj Alam, Maram Hasanain, Abul Hasnat, Fabrizio Silvestri, Preslav Nakov, and Giovanni Da San Martino. *SemEval-2024 task 4: Multilingual detection of persuasion techniques in memes*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2024, Mexico City, Mexico.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details about each dataset, including their purpose and any relevant characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or processing.
