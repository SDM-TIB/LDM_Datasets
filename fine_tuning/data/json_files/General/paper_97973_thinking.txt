To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty quantification and exploration-exploitation trade-off in humans" by Antonio Candelieri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and motivation for the study, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or analysis.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **Materials and Methods** or **Experimental Setup**. In this paper, section 4 titled "Experimental setup" is crucial, as it details the data collection process. Here, I will focus on the subsection **4.1 Data collection**, which describes how data was gathered from human participants through a gaming application.

In this section, the authors mention that they collected data from **fourteen volunteers** who participated in a game designed to solve optimization tasks. The paper specifies that each participant solved **ten different tasks**, which were based on **global optimization test functions**. This indicates that the dataset consists of the decisions made by these volunteers during the game.

I will also check the **Appendix** section, specifically **Appendix A**, where the authors provide a link to the ten global optimization test functions used in the study. This link is essential for understanding the nature of the tasks and the data collected.

Now, I will compile the relevant datasets and their citations:

1. **Human Decision-Making Data**: This dataset includes the decisions made by fourteen volunteers in a gaming application designed to optimize black-box functions. The data consists of the choices made and the associated scores observed during the game.
   - Citation: Candelieri, A., Perego, R., Giordani, I., Ponti, A., Archetti, F. (2020). Modelling human active search in optimizing black-box functions. *Soft Computing*, 24, 17771â€“17785. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-020-05398-2

2. **Global Optimization Test Functions**: The ten test functions used in the study are available at the provided link, which details their analytical formulations and search spaces.
   - Citation: Surjano, S. (n.d.). Global optimization test functions. Retrieved from https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, as this is crucial for proper attribution and further research. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any required structured output or documentation format.
