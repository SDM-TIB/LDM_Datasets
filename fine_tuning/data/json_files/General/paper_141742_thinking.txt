To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LHU-NET: A Light Hybrid U-Net for Cost-Efficient, High-Performance Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation" by Yousef Sadegheih et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on **five benchmark datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental setup and analysis)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MICCAI Multi-Atlas Abdomen Labeling Challenge (Synapse)**: This dataset consists of 30 abdominal CT scans, with detailed annotations for eight major abdominal organs. The authors provide specifics about the dataset's size and the training/testing split.

2. **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)**: This dataset includes cine MRI images from 100 patients, focusing on three major cardiac structures. The authors describe the dataset's characteristics and the preprocessing steps taken.

3. **Left Atrial Dataset (LA)**: This dataset comprises 100 three-dimensional MR images, with specific resolutions and preprocessing methods outlined.

4. **NIH Pancreas Dataset (CT-82)**: This dataset contains 82 annotated CT scans of the abdominal region, with details on the resolution and organization of the dataset.

5. **Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2018**: This dataset includes pre-operative MRI scans from multiple institutions, with annotations for tumor segmentation. The authors provide information on the preprocessing methods used.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
