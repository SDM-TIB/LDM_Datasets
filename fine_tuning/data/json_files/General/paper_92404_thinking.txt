To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deformation-aware Semi-supervised Learning: Application to Small Vessel Segmentation with Noisy Training Data" by Soumick Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a "small imperfect semi-automatically segmented dataset of only 11 subjects," which indicates that a specific dataset is being utilized.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets and Labels)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors specify that they used a high-resolution TOF-MRA dataset obtained from 11 subjects imaged at 7T, which is crucial for their experiments. They also mention that the dataset was chosen because it contains more small vessels compared to a 3T scanner.

The paper states that the dataset was created by Mattern et al. (2018), which provides a clear reference to the original source of the dataset. Additionally, the authors describe the process of label creation using Ilastik, which is important for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors refer to publicly available MRA images from the IXI dataset, which is used for evaluating the generalization capabilities of their proposed method. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **7T TOF-MRA Dataset**: 
   - Citation:
     > Mattern, H., Sciarra, A., Godenschweger, F., Stucht, D., LÃ¼sebrink, F., Rose, G., & Speck, O. (2018). Prospective motion correction enables highest resolution time-of-flight angiography at 7T. *Magnetic Resonance in Medicine*, 80(1), 248-258. doi:10.1002/mrm.27033.

2. **IXI Dataset**: 
   - Citation:
     > IXI dataset. Retrieved from https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of each dataset, including their purpose and how they were utilized in the research. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, along with their proper citations for reference.
