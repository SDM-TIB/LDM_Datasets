To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AvatarPoser: Articulated Full-Body Pose Tracking from Sparse Motion Sensing" by Jiaxi Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the method was evaluated on "large motion capture datasets (AMASS)," which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors mention using subsets of the **AMASS dataset** for training and testing. They specify that they used the **CMU**, **BMLrub**, and **HDM05** subsets within AMASS. This is a crucial detail as it identifies the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **AMASS Dataset**: The citation for the AMASS dataset is:
   > Mahmood, N., Ghorbani, N., Troje, N.F., Pons-Moll, G., & Black, M.J. (2019). *AMASS: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 5442–5451.

2. **CMU MoCap Dataset**: The citation for the CMU MoCap dataset is:
   > CMU MoCap Dataset. (2004). Retrieved from http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/

3. **BMLrub Dataset**: The citation for the BMLrub dataset is:
   > Troje, N.F. (2002). *Decomposing biological motion: A framework for analysis and synthesis of human gait patterns*. Journal of Vision, 2(5), 2.

4. **HDM05 Dataset**: The citation for the HDM05 dataset is:
   > Müller, M., Röder, T., Clausen, M., Eberhardt, B., Krüger, B., & Weber, A. (2007). *Documentation mocap database hdm05*. Tech. Rep. CG-2007-2, Universität Bonn.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
