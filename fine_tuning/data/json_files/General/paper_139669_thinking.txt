To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Era of 1-bit LLMs" by Shuming Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new model variant, BitNet b1.58, but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction discusses the training of models on the RedPajama dataset, which indicates that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will look into the **results** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets used for training and evaluation. In the results section, the authors mention evaluating their model on various benchmarks, including:

1. **ARC-Easy**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the results, indicating its importance in evaluating the model's performance.
2. **ARC-Challenge**: Similar to ARC-Easy, this dataset is also mentioned in the context of performance evaluation.
3. **Hellaswag**: Another dataset referenced for zero-shot accuracy evaluation.
4. **Winogrande**: This dataset is included in the performance comparisons.
5. **PIQA**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation benchmarks.
6. **Open-bookQA**: Also included in the evaluation metrics.
7. **BoolQ**: This dataset is referenced for evaluating the model's performance.

In addition to these, the authors mention the **WikiText2** and **C4** datasets for validation perplexity, which are also important to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **RedPajama Dataset**:
  > Together Computer. *Redpajama: an open dataset for training large language models*, 2023.

- For **ARC-Easy** and **ARC-Challenge**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or processing.
