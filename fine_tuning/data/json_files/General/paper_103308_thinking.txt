To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Benchmarking the Robustness of Instance Segmentation Models" by Said Fahri Altındis¸ et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating instance segmentation models on "real-world image corruptions" and "out-of-domain image collections," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsections that discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention using the **COCO dataset** for training and validation, as well as the **Cityscapes** and **BDD** datasets for cross-domain evaluation. 

1. **COCO Dataset**: The paper states that models are trained on the COCO training set, which is a widely used dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks. The authors do not provide a detailed description of the dataset in this section, but it is a well-known dataset in the field.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The authors describe the Cityscapes dataset as consisting of urban street scene images collected for autonomous driving applications. They mention that it includes annotations for eight instance classes.

3. **BDD Dataset**: The BDD dataset is mentioned as containing diverse images from various locations, including New York and San Francisco, and is used for evaluating the models on different scene types.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

- For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For the **BDD dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Yu, Y. Chen, F. Liu, V. Madhavan, and T. Darrell. *BDD100K: A Diverse Driving Dataset for Heterogeneous Multitask Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
