To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Realistic PointGoal Navigation via Auxiliary Losses and Information Bottleneck" by Guillermo N. Grande, Dhruv Batra, and Erik Wijmans, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation or training.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or benchmarks related to PointGoal navigation. This section often contains context about the datasets used in the experiments.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experimental setup and may specify the datasets they used for training and evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the **Habitat simulator** and **Gibson dataset** for training and evaluation. The Gibson dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of embodied AI and navigation tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Gibson Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Fei Xia, Amir R Zamir, Zhiyang He, Alexander Sax, Jitendra Malik, and Silvio Savarese. *Gibson env: Real-world perception for embodied agents*. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018. Gibson dataset license agreement available at https://storage.googleapis.com/gibson_material/Agreement%20GDS%2006-04-18.pdf.

Next, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I follow the required format for each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and future reference.
