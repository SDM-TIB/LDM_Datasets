To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ALISA: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference via Sparsity-Aware KV Caching" by Youpeng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of ALISA on various LLM models and tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors mention using three open-sourced families of LLM models: OPT, LLaMA, and Pythia. They also specify that they perform evaluations on seven different datasets for language modeling and question-answering tasks. This is a strong indication that datasets are explicitly listed.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors detail the datasets used:
1. **Wiki-Text-2**: A dataset for language modeling.
2. **Penn Treebank**: Another dataset for language modeling.
3. **Alpaca**: A dataset used for 4-shot question-answering inference.
4. **PIQA**: A dataset for reasoning about physical commonsense in natural language.
5. **COPA**: A dataset for evaluating causal reasoning.
6. **Open-BookQA**: A dataset for open book question answering.
7. **Winogrande**: A dataset for commonsense reasoning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, since some datasets may not have formal citations in the references, I will note the ones that do:

- **Wiki-Text-2** citation:
  > Merity, S., Xiong, C., Bradbury, J., & Socher, R. (2016). Pointer sentinel mixture models. *ArXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843*.

- **PIQA** citation:

For **Alpaca**, the authors reference a GitHub repository rather than a formal citation:
> Taori, R., Gulrajani, I., Zhang, T., Dubois, Y., Li, X., Guestrin, P., Liang, P., & Hashimoto, T. B. (2023). Stanford Alpaca: An instruction-following LLaMA model. *GitHub repository*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
