To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Waveform Optimization and Beam Focusing for Near-field Wireless Power Transfer with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas and Non-linear Energy Harvesters" by Amirhossein Azarbahram et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in the research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the study, which may include specific datasets that the authors have utilized.

I will then check the **methodology or experiments section** for detailed descriptions of the datasets. This section typically contains information about the data collection process, the specific datasets used, and any relevant parameters or characteristics of those datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will look there as well, as authors sometimes refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results to previous studies.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for the complete citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.

Finally, I will organize this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
