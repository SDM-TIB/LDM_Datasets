To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Expanding continual few-shot learning benchmarks to include recognition of specific instances" by Gideon Kowadlo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the continual few-shot learning framework and mentions the use of specific datasets for experiments, which suggests that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will examine the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, particularly focusing on any sections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors refer to two datasets: **Omniglot** and **SlimageNet64**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they conducted their experiments using these datasets. They mention that Omniglot is a well-known dataset for few-shot learning, while SlimageNet64 is a modified version of ImageNet designed for their specific experiments. This confirms that both datasets are integral to the research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For **Omniglot**, the citation is:
> Lake BM, Salakhutdinov R, Tenenbaum JB. *Human-level concept learning through probabilistic program induction*. Science. 2015;350(6266):1332â€“1338. doi:10.1126/science.aab3050.

For **SlimageNet64**, the citation is:
> Antoniou A, Patacchiola M, Ochal M, Storkey A. *Defining Benchmarks for Continual Few-Shot Learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.11967. 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they are essential for academic integrity and further research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.
