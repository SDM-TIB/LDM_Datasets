To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Batch Selection and Communication for Active Learning with Edge Labeling" by Victor Croisfelt et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous work or in the current study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the datasets utilized.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used for training or testing the proposed methods. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that are highlighted.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the complete citation format as presented in the references.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for the citation that typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. If they refer to a specific dataset from another paper, I will trace back to that original source for the citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
