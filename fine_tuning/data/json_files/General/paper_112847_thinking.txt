To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic extraction of coronary arteries using deep learning in invasive coronary angiograms" by Yinghui Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that a dataset containing **616 ICAs obtained from 210 patients** was used, which indicates that this is a primary dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically under **2.1 Patient data**, where the authors provide more details about the dataset. They mention that the dataset consists of **616 ICA images**, with a breakdown of **405 left coronary artery (LCA) images** and **211 right coronary artery (RCA) images**. This section also notes that the images were manually annotated by trained operators, which is important for understanding the dataset's quality.

In the **Results and Analysis** section, the authors reiterate the use of the **616 ICA images** and provide further context about how these images were divided into training, validation, and test sets. They specify that **437 images were used for training**, **49 for validation**, and **130 for testing**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own collection of images, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note that the dataset is original and created by the authors for this study.

The citation for the paper itself, which includes the dataset, is:
> Yinghui Meng, Zhenglong Du, Chen Zhao, Minghao Dong, Drew Pienta, Zhihui Xu, Weihua Zhou. *Automatic extraction of coronary arteries using deep learning in invasive coronary angiograms*. 

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: Invasive Coronary Angiograms (ICA)
   - **Description**: A dataset containing 616 ICA images obtained from 210 patients, including 405 left coronary artery (LCA) images and 211 right coronary artery (RCA) images. The images were manually annotated by trained operators.
   - **Citation**: Yinghui Meng, Zhenglong Du, Chen Zhao, Minghao Dong, Drew Pienta, Zhihui Xu, Weihua Zhou. *Automatic extraction of coronary arteries using deep learning in invasive coronary angiograms*.

With this information compiled, I will prepare to format it according to the specified requirements for further processing or review.
