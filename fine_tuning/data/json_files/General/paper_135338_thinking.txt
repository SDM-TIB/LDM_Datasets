To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SwiftLearn: A Data-Efficient Training Method of Deep Learning Models using Importance Sampling" by Habib Hajimolahoseini et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various CV (computer vision) and NLP (natural language processing) models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets along with specific tasks and performance metrics. 

From the text, I identify the following datasets:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This is a collection of datasets for evaluating natural language understanding systems. The authors mention that BERT finetuning on the GLUE benchmark shows that almost 90% of the data can be dropped while maintaining a small accuracy drop.

2. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks. The authors state that they pretrained the SwinT model on the ImageNet dataset.

3. **LibriSpeech**: This dataset is used for automatic speech recognition tasks. The authors mention that they pretrained the Conformer model on the LibriSpeech dataset.

4. **SST-2**: A sentiment analysis dataset used for finetuning the RoBERTa model. The authors report results from finetuning on this dataset.

5. **WMT 2016**: A dataset used for machine translation tasks. The authors mention finetuning the T5 model on this dataset.

6. **Chinese-wiki**: A dataset used for pretraining BERT-Large, which is mentioned in the context of its performance metrics.

Now, I will look up the full citations for each of these datasets in the **References section** of the paper:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference or processing.
