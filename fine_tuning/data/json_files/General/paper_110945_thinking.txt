To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Engineering deep learning methods on automatic detection of damage in infrastructure due to extreme events" by Yongsheng Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions "training datasets and codes will be made available for the public," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets and damage classification with deep learning in SDD and SHM** section, as it is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the studies. Here, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **PEER Hub ImageNet (φ-Net) Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 36,413 pairs of images and labels at various scales, used for multiple classification tasks related to structural damage. 

2. **Concrete Surface Crack (CSC) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 40,000 images, half of which are labeled as cracking and non-cracking at the pixel level. 

3. **MCEI2017 Dataset**: This dataset includes images collected after the 2017 Mexico City earthquake, specifically for damage assessment.

4. **PEI2017 Dataset**: Similar to the MCEI2017 dataset, this one contains images collected after the 2017 Pohang earthquake.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For the **φ-Net Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **CSC Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MCEI2017 Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further study and application.
