To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skin Cancer Segmentation and Classification with NABLA-N and Inception Recurrent Residual Convolutional Networks" by Md Zahangir Alom et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the proposed models are evaluated on benchmark datasets from the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 (ISIC-2018)**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for both segmentation and classification tasks. Here, they explicitly mention the **ISIC 2018 dataset** for both tasks, providing details about the number of images and their classification.

In the **Results and Discussion** section, the authors specify that for segmentation, they used a total of **2,594 images** with corresponding masks, and for classification, they used **10,015 samples**. They also describe the classes present in the ISIC 2018 dataset, which includes seven different types of skin cancers.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ISIC 2018 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ISIC 2018 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Codella, Noel CF, Q-B. Nguyen, Sharath Pankanti, D. A. Gutman, Brian Helba, A. C. Halpern, and John R. Smith. "Deep learning ensembles for melanoma recognition in dermoscopy images." IBM Journal of Research and Development 61, no. 4/5 (2017): 5-1.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
