To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata and Recurrent Networks, Revisited" by Sarah E. Marzen and James P. Crutchfield, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of various models on a suite of probabilistic deterministic finite-state automata (PDFA), which suggests that there may be datasets related to these automata.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or provide context about the data used in their experiments. They refer to a "large suite of probabilistic deterministic finite-state automata," but I need to find specific names or references to datasets.

In the **results section**, the authors describe their experiments with various time series predictors on "all 1,388 randomly-generated PDFAs with four states or less." This indicates that the dataset consists of these PDFAs, but I need to confirm if there is a formal citation or reference for this dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset of PDFAs. If the authors refer to a specific source or paper that describes how these PDFAs were generated or provides access to them, I will note that citation.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

For example, if the authors refer to a specific dataset of PDFAs, I will include the citation as follows:

- For the dataset of PDFAs, the citation might be:
  > B. D. Johnson, J. P. Crutchfield, C. J. Ellison, and C. S. McTague. "Enumerating finitary processes." arxiv.org:1011.0036.

Once I have gathered all relevant information and citations, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
