To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Multimodal Multitask Multilingual Learning" by Aman Chadha and Vinija Jain, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often outlines the key tasks and datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various tasks and mention that they utilize datasets for tasks such as visual entailment (VE), visual question answering (VQA), and natural language understanding (NLU). This indicates that there are specific datasets associated with these tasks.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Tasks and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I find the following datasets:

1. **CoNLL-2003**: Used for neural entity recognition (NER).
2. **GLUE benchmark**: Includes several datasets such as QNLI, MNLI, QQP, and SST-2 for language understanding tasks.
3. **SNLI-VE**: Used for visual entailment tasks.
4. **VQAv2 dataset**: Used for visual question answering, with additional questions from Visual Genome and OK-VQA.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **CoNLL-2003**, the citation is:
  > Erik F Sang and Fien De Meulder. *Introduction to the conll-2003 shared task: Language-independent named entity recognition*. arXiv preprint cs/0306050, 2003.

- For the **GLUE benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R Bowman. *Glue: A multi-task benchmark and analysis platform for natural language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.07461, 2018.

- For **SNLI-VE**, the citation is:
  > Ning Xie, Farley Lai, Derek Doran, and Asim Kadav. *Visual entailment: A novel task for fine-grained image understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06706, 2019.

- For the **VQAv2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yash Goyal, Tejas Khot, Douglas Summers-Stay, Dhruv Batra, and Devi Parikh. *Making the v in vqa matter: Elevating the role of image understanding in visual question answering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 6904â€“6913, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented for any further processing or review.
