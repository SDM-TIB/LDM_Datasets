To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fully Automatic Intervertebral Disc Segmentation Using Multimodal 3D U-Net" by Chuanbo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments in detail. They mention that the dataset consists of 8 sets of 3D multi-modality MRI spine images collected from 8 patients, which is crucial information.

In this section, I will note the specifics of the dataset:
- The dataset includes images from two different stages of a prolonged bed test.
- Each spine image contains at least 7 intervertebral discs (IVDs) of the lower spine (T1-L5) and four modalities following the Dixon protocol: in-phase, opposed-phase, fat, and water images.
- The segmentation ground truth is composed of binary masks manually labeled by three trained raters.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset was provided by Prof. Guoyan Zheng from the University of Bern. I will look for any relevant papers or reports authored by Prof. Zheng that describe this dataset in detail.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the full citation, into a structured format. The citation for the dataset will be based on the original source or the paper that describes the dataset comprehensively.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details about the dataset, including its purpose, characteristics, and the context in which it was used in the research. This will allow me to present a complete and informative entry for the dataset extracted from the paper.
