To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Transformer for Comics Text-Cloze" by Emanuele Vivoli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the release of new OCR annotations for the dataset, which indicates that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In section 4.1, they provide statistics about the dataset used for the text-cloze task, which includes details about the number of objects, pages, panels, and textboxes. This section is crucial as it likely contains the dataset's name and its characteristics.

I will also check the **related works section** for any references to existing datasets that the authors may have used or built upon. This could provide context or additional datasets that are relevant to their research.

In the **data section (4.1)**, the authors mention that their experimental dataset is sourced from a previous work, specifically citing the original dataset used for the text-cloze task. They provide statistics about the dataset, which includes:

1. **Comics Dataset**: This dataset includes a comprehensive collection of comic panels, text, and OCR data. The statistics indicate that it contains 198,657 pages and 1,229,664 panels.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to a previous work for their dataset, which is likely to be listed in the references. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find the following citation that corresponds to the dataset:

- For the **Comics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Iyyer, M., Manjunatha, V., Guha, A., Vyas, Y., Boyd-Graber, J., Daumé III, H., & Davis, L. (2017). The Amazing Mysteries of the Gutter: Drawing Inferences Between Panels in Comic Book Narratives. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 6478–6487. https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR.2017.686

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. 

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading through the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Focusing on the experiments section for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Checking the references for full citations of the datasets mentioned.
4. Compiling the dataset information and citations for clarity and completeness.
