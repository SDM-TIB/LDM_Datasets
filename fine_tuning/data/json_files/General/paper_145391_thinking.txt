To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaGPT: Merging Large Language Models Using Model Exclusive Task Arithmetic" by Yuyan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of multi-task learning and the challenges associated with it, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 6 (Experiments)**, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **WinoGrande**: A dataset for evaluating general knowledge performance.
2. **AGIEval**: Another dataset for assessing general knowledge.
3. **GSM8k**: A dataset for testing mathematical reasoning ability.
4. **MATH**: A dataset focused on mathematical problems.
5. **MBPP**: A dataset for evaluating code generation capabilities.
6. **HumanEval**: A dataset for assessing code generation.
7. **JEC-QA**: A dataset for legal-domain question answering.
8. **FinanceIQ**: A dataset for financial question answering.
9. **MedQA**: A dataset for medical question answering.

Next, I will gather the details for each dataset, including the number of training, validation, and testing examples, as well as the evaluation metrics used. This information is typically found in tables or descriptive text within the experiments section.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

- For **WinoGrande**, the citation is:
  > Sakaguchi, K., Le Bras, R., Bhagavatula, C., & Choi, Y. (2021). *Winogrande: An adversarial winograd schema challenge at scale*. Communications of the ACM, 64(9), 99–106.

- For **AGIEval**, the citation is:

- For **GSM8k**, the citation is:
  > Cobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., ... & Schulman, J. (2021). *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168.

- For **MATH**, the citation is:

- For **JEC-QA**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, H., Xiao, C., Tu, C., ... & Sun, M. (2020). *JEC-QA: A legal-domain question answering dataset*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, 34, 9701–9708.

- For **FinanceIQ**, the citation is:
  > Duxiaoman DI. (2023). *FinanceIQ*. URL: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Duxiaoman-DI/FinanceIQ.

- For **MedQA**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
