To extract datasets from the research paper titled "xDeepInt: a hybrid architecture for modeling the vector-wise and bit-wise feature interactions" by Yachen Yan and Liubo Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their model on **three real-world datasets**. This indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in **section 4.1 (Experiment Setup)**, where they describe the datasets used for evaluation.

The three datasets mentioned are:

1. **Avazu Dataset**: This dataset is from a Kaggle competition in 2015 and consists of 10 days of click-through data with 21 categorical features.

2. **Criteo Dataset**: This dataset is from a Kaggle competition in 2014 and contains 13 numerical features and 26 categorical features. The numerical features are transformed into categorical features for modeling.

3. **iPinYou Dataset**: This dataset is from the iPinYou Global RTB Bidding Algorithm Competition in 2013 and includes 16 categorical features.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. However, the datasets themselves may not have dedicated citations in the references, as they are often well-known datasets used in the research community. Therefore, I will provide the citations based on the context given in the paper:

- For the **Avazu Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction Dataset*. Kaggle, 2015. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction)

- For the **Criteo Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. *Criteo Display Ad Challenge Dataset*. Kaggle, 2014. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge)

- For the **iPinYou Dataset**, the citation is:
  > iPinYou. *iPinYou Global RTB Bidding Algorithm Competition Dataset*. 2013. [Link](http://contest.ipinyou.com/)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
