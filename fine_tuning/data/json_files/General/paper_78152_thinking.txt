To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PQk-means: Billion-scale Clustering for Product-quantized Codes" by Yusuke Matsui et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the efficiency of the proposed PQk-means method and mentions clustering on large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any tables or figures that summarize dataset statistics, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their names, dimensions, and the number of samples.

Upon reviewing **Table 2**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ILSVRC 100C**: This dataset consists of 100 object categories, each containing around 1000 images, with a total of 129,395 test images. The features extracted are 4096D AlexNet features.

2. **ILSVRC 1000C**: A larger subset of the ImageNet dataset, containing 1,281,167 images, also with 4096D AlexNet features.

3. **SIFT1M**: This dataset contains 1 million SIFT features, each represented in 128 dimensions.

4. **SIFT1B**: A larger dataset containing 1 billion SIFT features, also represented in 128 dimensions.

5. **YFCC100M**: This dataset contains around 100 million images, with features extracted using AlexNet, resulting in 4096D feature vectors.

6. **Deep1B**: This dataset consists of 1 billion features extracted from images using GoogLeNet, with features compressed to 96 dimensions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the **ILSVRC datasets**, the citation is:
> Olga Russakovsky et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. IJCV, 2015.

For the **YFCC100M dataset**, the citation is:
> Bart Thomee et al. *YFCC100M: The New Data in Multimedia Research*. Commun. ACM, 2016.

For the **SIFT1M and SIFT1B datasets**, the citation is:
> Marius Muja and David G. Lowe. *Scalable Nearest Neighbour Algorithms for High Dimensional Data*. IEEE TPAMI, 2014.

For the **Deep1B dataset**, the citation is:
> Artem Babenko and Victor Lempitsky. *Efficient Indexing of Billion-Scale Datasets of Deep Descriptors*. In Proc. IEEE CVPR, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and ready for any further processing or review.
