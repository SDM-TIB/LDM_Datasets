To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Classifier Mimicry without Data Access" by Steven Braun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors empirically corroborate their method using several benchmark datasets. This indicates that there are datasets used in their experiments, but I need to find the specific names.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically provide detailed information about the datasets used. In the methodology section, the authors discuss the Contrastive Abductive Knowledge Extraction (CAKE) method, but I need to find explicit mentions of datasets.

I will pay close attention to any sections that might be dedicated to **experiments** or **results**, as these often summarize the datasets used for evaluation. If there are tables or figures, I will examine them for any dataset names or descriptions.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
2. **MNIST**: A classic dataset of handwritten digits, containing 70,000 images of digits from 0 to 9.
3. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, which contains over 600,000 labeled digits from real-world images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, LÃ©on Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. IEEE, 1998.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

With the dataset names and their citations collected, I will now prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing or review.
