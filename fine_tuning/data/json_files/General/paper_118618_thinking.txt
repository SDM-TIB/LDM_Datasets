To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Heterogeneous Recurrent Spiking Neural Network for Spatio-Temporal Classification" by Biswadeep Chakraborty and Saibal Mukhopadhyay, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on several datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using three RGB datasets: **KTH, UCF11, and UCF101**, as well as an event-based dataset called **DVS128 Gesture**. I will note down these datasets and their characteristics as described in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for each dataset, which helps confirm that these datasets were indeed used for evaluation. They report accuracies for the KTH dataset (94.32%), UCF11 (79.58%), UCF101 (77.33%), and DVS128 Gesture (96.54%).

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **KTH Dataset**: 
  > Schuldt, C., Laptev, I., & Caputo, B. (2004). *Recognizing human actions: A local SVM approach*. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), 2004.

- **UCF11 Dataset**: 
  > Ryoo, M. S., & Aggarwal, J. K. (2009). *Human activity recognition with metric learning and multiple instance learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- **UCF101 Dataset**: 
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A. R., & Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402.

- **DVS128 Gesture Dataset**: 
  > Orchard, G., et al. (2015). *Event-based gesture recognition using a spiking neural network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited for future reference or processing.
