To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coverage Analysis of Downlink Transmission in Multi-Connectivity Cellular V2X Networks" by Luofang Jiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but I need to look for specific datasets used in the analysis.

Next, I will check the **experiments or results sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets. In this paper, the authors discuss the use of Monte Carlo simulations to validate their analytical framework. I will look for any datasets or simulation parameters that are defined in this context.

In the **numerical and simulation results section**, the authors mention a communication scenario on a straight urban freeway and provide a table summarizing the system parameters. However, they do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets. Instead, they focus on simulation parameters, which may not qualify as datasets in the traditional sense.

I will also review the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant to the study. The references include various papers on C-V2X and multi-connectivity, but I need to determine if any of these papers provide datasets that were utilized in this research.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will summarize the relevant simulation parameters instead, as they are crucial for reproducing the experiments. However, I will note that no specific datasets were identified in this paper.

Finally, I will compile the findings, including any relevant citations from the references section that may lead to datasets used in similar studies or methodologies.

In conclusion, while this paper does not provide explicit datasets, I will document the simulation parameters and any relevant citations that could guide further exploration of datasets in the context of C-V2X networks.
