To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAANet: Ghost Auto Anchor Network for Detecting Varying Size Drones in Dark" by Misha Urooj Khan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a **custom IR dataset** with multiple classes, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the creation of a **customized dataset** for multi-class IR-images detection. This is a key point that indicates the dataset's relevance to their research.

In the **model evaluation section**, the authors provide more details about the dataset used for training GAANet. They mention that they gathered around **5105 IR images** of various classes (birds, drones, planes, and helicopters) from publicly available open-source datasets on **RoboFlow**. This indicates that the dataset is not only custom but also sourced from an established platform.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the RoboFlow dataset. The authors reference their own work regarding the dataset, which is available on GitHub. The citation for this dataset is:

- **Custom IR Dataset**: 
  > M. U. Khan, Z. Kaleem, and M. Misbah, "GitHub - ZeeshanKaleem/GhostAutoAnchorNet," 2022. Accessed 2022-12-08.

Now, I will summarize the findings about the dataset:

1. **Custom IR Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5105 IR images of various classes (birds, drones, planes, and helicopters) collected from RoboFlow. It is specifically designed for multi-class detection in challenging weather conditions.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for future reference or processing.
