To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SpatialRGPT: Grounded Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models" by An-Chieh Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a benchmark called **SpatialRGBT-Bench** and a dataset called **Open Spatial Dataset (OSD)**, which suggests that these are key datasets to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology section**. In the section discussing the data pipeline, the authors describe the **Open Spatial Dataset (OSD)**, which encompasses 8.7 million spatial concepts grounded in 5 million unique regions. This dataset includes 1 million unique images and is associated with various question-answer pairs.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the use of the **SpatialRGBT-Bench** for evaluating spatial cognition in VLMs. The authors mention that this benchmark is based on ground-truth 3D annotations and spans various environments, which further emphasizes its importance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Open Spatial Dataset (OSD)**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for this dataset in the references, but they mention that it will be released upon publication. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is forthcoming and will include a citation once it is publicly available.

2. **SpatialRGBT-Bench**: Similar to the OSD, the authors do not provide a specific citation for this benchmark in the references, indicating that it is also forthcoming.

Since both datasets are mentioned as forthcoming, I will note that they are significant contributions of the paper and will be available for citation in the future.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the relevant details and the status of their citations. This will help in organizing the information for future reference or processing.
