To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximating ReLU on a Reduced Ring for Efficient MPC-based Private Inference" by Kiwan Maeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the HummingBird framework and its performance improvements, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will look for more details in the introduction and experimental sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of machine learning inference and privacy-sensitive data but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section** to find any references to datasets used for evaluation.

In **section 5 (Evaluation Results)**, the authors mention three datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also widely used in machine learning research.

3. **TinyImageNet**: A smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 200 classes with 500 training images and 50 validation images per class. It is often used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford University. *TinyImageNet download link*. http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip, 2023.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, description, and full citation.
