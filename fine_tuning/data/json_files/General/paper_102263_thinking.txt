To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Woodscape Fisheye Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Driving" by Saravanabalagi Ramachandran et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the challenge used the **WoodScape dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more details about the datasets. The authors mention the **WoodScape dataset** as the world's first public surround view fisheye automotive dataset, which provides a comprehensive overview of its purpose and significance in the context of autonomous driving.

I will then look into the **datasets section** (which is often explicitly labeled in research papers) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe the **WoodScape dataset** in detail, including its structure, the number of samples (10,000), and the types of annotations provided (e.g., segmentation, depth estimation, etc.).

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **WoodScape dataset** is as follows:
> Saravanabalagi Yogamani, C. Hughes, J. Horgan, G. Sistu, P. Varley, D. O’Dea, M. Uricar, S. Milz, M. Simon, K. Amende, et al. *Woodscape: A multi-task, multi-camera fisheye dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (CVPR), 2019, pp. 9308–9318.

The paper also references other datasets, such as the **Oxford Robotcar dataset** and **OmniScape**, which I will also extract and cite. The citations for these datasets are:

- For the **Oxford Robotcar dataset**:
  > W. Maddern, G. Pascoe, C. Linegar, and P. Newman. *1 year, 1000 km: The Oxford Robotcar Dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 36, no. 1, pp. 3–15, 2017.

- For the **OmniScape dataset**:
  > A. R. Sekkat, Y. Dupuis, P. Vasseur, and P. Honeine. *The OmniScape Dataset*. In 2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1603–1608.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the **WoodScape dataset**, **Oxford Robotcar dataset**, and **OmniScape dataset**, along with their respective citations.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
