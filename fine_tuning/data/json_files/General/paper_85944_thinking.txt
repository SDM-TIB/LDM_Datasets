To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Czech Text Processing with Contextual Embeddings" by Milan Straka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their methods on four Czech text processing tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their evaluations. This section is likely to contain detailed information about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5**: This dataset is described as the 2018 edition of the core Prague Dependency Treebank, containing various layers of annotations, including morphological and syntactic annotations. The authors provide details about its structure and evaluation metrics.

2. **Universal Dependencies 2.3**: This dataset is part of the Universal Dependencies project, which aims to create consistent treebank annotations across languages. The authors mention that they evaluate the Czech PDT treebank of UD 2.3, which is derived from the Prague Dependency Treebank.

3. **Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1**: This corpus consists of Czech sentences with manually annotated named entities. The authors provide statistics about the number of sentences and entities.

4. **Czech Named Entity Corpus 2.0**: An updated version of the CNEC, this dataset contains more sentences and entities than the previous version.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5**, the citation is:
  > Hajič, J., et al. *Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5*. 2018. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University.

- For **Universal Dependencies 2.3**, the citation is:
  > Nivre, J., et al. *Universal Dependencies 2.3*. 2018. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University.

- For **Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1**, the citation is:
  > Ševčíková, M., et al. *Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1*. 2014. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University.

- For **Czech Named Entity Corpus 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Ševčíková, M., et al. *Czech Named Entity Corpus 2.0*. 2014. LINDAT/CLARIN digital library at the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, Charles University.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
