To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PatentTransformer-2: Controlling Patent Text Generation by Structural Metadata" by Jieh-Sheng Lee and Jieh Hsiang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors release their GPT-2 models and code for inference, which suggests that they may have used specific datasets for training.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their previous works and the evolution of their models, but I need to focus on the **data section** for specific dataset information. 

In **section 3 (Data)**, the authors mention that the raw data for training their GPT-2 models comes from the **Google Patents Public Datasets on BigQuery**. They specify that they collected utility patents from **1976 to August 2017**. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also provide details about the size of the datasets:
- The dataset covering **1976 to 2016** contains **371,731,396 records**.
- The dataset for **2016** contains **20,756,172 records**.
- The dataset for **January to August 2017** contains **12,488,254 records**.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Google Patents Public Datasets. However, since this dataset is a public dataset and not a traditional publication, I will note the URL provided in the paper for accessing the dataset.

The citation for the dataset will be:
> Google Patents Public Datasets. Available at: https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=patents-public-data

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Google Patents Public Datasets**: Contains utility patents from 1976 to August 2017, with specific record counts for different time periods.

I will now prepare the final output with the dataset details and citations.
