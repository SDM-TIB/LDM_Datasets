To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer-Based Deep Learning Detector for Dual-Mode Index Modulation 3D-OFDM" by Toan Gian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the significance of deep learning in signal detection but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** where the authors describe the training process for their proposed TransD3D-IM detector.

In the **model training section**, the authors mention that the TransD3D-IM model is trained using a simulation dataset. However, they do not provide a specific name or citation for this dataset. This indicates that the dataset may be a synthetic one generated for the purpose of their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if any datasets are referenced. The authors compare their results with existing methods but do not provide additional details about the datasets used for training or evaluation.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited in the context of previous works. The references primarily consist of papers discussing various aspects of OFDM and deep learning but do not specifically mention datasets.

Since the paper does not provide explicit names or citations for any datasets, I will conclude that the primary dataset used is a simulation dataset created by the authors for their experiments. I will note that while the authors reference existing literature, they do not provide a formal dataset citation.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Simulation Dataset**: The authors utilized a simulation dataset for training the TransD3D-IM model, but no specific name or citation is provided.

Since there are no formal dataset citations to include, I will ensure to mention this limitation in my final output.
