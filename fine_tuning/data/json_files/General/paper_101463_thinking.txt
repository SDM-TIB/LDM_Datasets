To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Dynamic Spatial-temporal Attention Network for Early Anticipation of Traffic Accidents" by Muhammad Monjurul Karim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Implementation and Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe two datasets:

1. **Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD)**: This dataset contains a diverse set of videos captured across different cities in Taiwan, with a total of 1,130 negative videos and 620 positive videos. The training dataset includes 455 positive and 829 negative videos, while the testing dataset comprises 165 positive and 301 negative videos.

2. **Car Crash Dataset (CCD)**: This dataset consists of 4,500 dashcam videos with a training/testing split of 80% and 20%. Each video lasts 5 seconds, and the ratio of positive to negative videos is 1:2.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD)**, the citation is:
> Chan, F.-H., Chen, Y.-T., Xiang, Y., & Sun, M. (2016). Anticipating accidents in dashcam videos. In *Asian Conference on Computer Vision* (pp. 136–153).

For the **Car Crash Dataset (CCD)**, the citation is:
> Bao, W., Yu, Q., & Kong, Y. (2020). Uncertainty-based traffic accident anticipation with spatio-temporal relational learning. In *Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia* (pp. 2682–2690).

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their sources from the paper.
