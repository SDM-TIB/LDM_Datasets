To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dirichlet Pruning for Neural Network Compression" by Kamil Adamczewski and Mijung Park, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction typically outlines the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In this section, they mention that they performed extensive experiments on three datasets: **MNIST**, **FashionMNIST**, and **CIFAR-10**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their research.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the text. The authors mention that MNIST and FashionMNIST were used to train the **LeNet-5** network, while **CIFAR-10** was used to train **ResNet-56**, **WideResNet-28-10**, and **VGG-16**. This information confirms the datasets' relevance to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for commonly used datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10 are well-known, but I will ensure to provide the correct references as they may be cited in the paper.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Strub. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017. Available: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
