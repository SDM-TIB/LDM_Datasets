To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An ADMM Solver for the MKL-L0/1-SVM" by Yijie Shi and Bin Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections related to experiments** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions a "simple numerical experiment on synthetic planar data," which suggests that there may be a dataset involved, albeit synthetic.

Next, I will check the **experiments section (Section VI)**, where the authors describe their numerical experiments. They mention using "two-dimensional (planar) data" generated randomly in four quadrants, which indicates that this is the dataset they utilized for their experiments. However, since this is synthetic data, it may not have a formal citation like publicly available datasets.

I will also look for any references to other datasets in the **References section**. However, it appears that the paper primarily focuses on synthetic data and does not cite any external datasets. The references mainly discuss theoretical aspects and previous works related to SVMs and kernel learning.

Since the only dataset mentioned is synthetic and does not have a formal citation, I will note that down as follows:

1. **Synthetic Planar Data**: The authors generated this dataset randomly in the four quadrants for the purpose of their experiments. It consists of two-dimensional data points labeled according to their quadrant.

As there are no formal citations for this synthetic dataset, I will summarize my findings accordingly.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring clarity and completeness in the description of the dataset, even though it lacks a formal citation.
