To extract datasets from the research paper titled "INGNN: Uplifting Message Passing Neural Network with Graph Original Information" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on both synthetic and real datasets, which indicates that there are datasets used in the research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors detail the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention using both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Specifically, they refer to a synthetic dataset called **syn-cora**, which is generated based on the Cora dataset, and they also list several real-world datasets including:

1. **Cora**: A widely-used citation dataset for machine learning research.
2. **CiteSeer**: Another citation dataset similar to Cora.
3. **PubMed**: A dataset consisting of scientific publications in the field of medicine.
4. **Coauthor CS**: A dataset of co-authorship networks in computer science.
5. **Coauthor Physics**: A dataset of co-authorship networks in physics.
6. **penn94**: A dataset representing social networks.
7. **arXiv-year**: A dataset from the arXiv repository.
8. **genius**: A dataset related to music lyrics and annotations.
9. **twitch-gamer**: A dataset related to Twitch users and their interactions.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details or statistics about these datasets, as they often provide more context or specific characteristics of the datasets used.

After identifying the datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

The citations I will need to gather include:

- For **Cora**:

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations for clarity and completeness. This structured approach ensures that I do not miss any important details and that the datasets are accurately represented.
