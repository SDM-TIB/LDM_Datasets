To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PALI-3 VISION LANGUAGE MODELS: SMALLER, FASTER, STRONGER" by Xiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors compare their model on various multimodal benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their use in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **WebLI**: This dataset is used for contrastive pretraining of the image encoder. It is mentioned in the context of training the ViT-G model and is derived from web-scale image-text pairs.

2. **RefCOCO**: This dataset is used for referring expression segmentation tasks. The authors mention that they fine-tune their model on the combined training sets of RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg.

3. **TextCaps**: This dataset is used for image captioning with reading comprehension. The authors evaluate their model on this benchmark.

4. **TextVQA**: This dataset is used for visual question answering tasks that require reading text in images.

5. **DocVQA**: This dataset is also used for visual question answering, specifically on document images.

6. **InfographicVQA**: Another dataset for visual question answering, focusing on infographics.

7. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset is used for video captioning tasks.

8. **VATEX**: Another dataset for video captioning.

9. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset is used for video captioning as well.

10. **NExT-QA**: This dataset is used for video question answering.

11. **MSR-VTT-QA**: This dataset is also used for video question answering.

12. **ActivityNet-QA**: Another dataset for video question answering.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I found:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
