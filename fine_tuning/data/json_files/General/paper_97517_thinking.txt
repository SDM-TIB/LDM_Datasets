To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fighting Deepfakes by Detecting GAN DCT Anomalies" by Oliver Giudice et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets and experiments**. The abstract mentions the need for new Deepfake detection algorithms and hints at the use of various datasets for testing their proposed method. This suggests that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Datasets Details)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two primary datasets:

1. **CelebA (CelebFaces Attributes Dataset)**: This dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with 40 labels related to facial attributes. The authors note that it covers a variety of poses and backgrounds, consisting of 178,218 JPEG images.

2. **FFHQ (Flickr-Faces-HQ)**: This dataset is described as a high-quality collection of human face images, featuring variations in age, ethnicity, and background. The images were sourced from Flickr and processed to ensure alignment and cropping, totaling 1024 PNG images.

In addition to these datasets, the authors also mention the use of various generative models (StarGAN, GDWCT, AttGAN, StyleGAN, and StyleGAN2) that were trained using these datasets to generate Deepfake images. However, the focus here is on the datasets themselves.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2015, pp. 3730–3738.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > T. Karras, S. Laine, and T. Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2019, pp. 4401–4410.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have captured all necessary details for future reference or processing. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process.
