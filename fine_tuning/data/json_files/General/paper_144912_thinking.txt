To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attri-Net: A Globally and Locally Inherently Interpretable Model for Multi-Label Classification Using Class-Specific Counterfactuals" by Susu Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed evaluations on **three chest X-ray datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In **section 4.1.1 (Data)**, they explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **CheXpert Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparisons. It is crucial to find the full citation for this dataset.

2. **ChestX-ray8 Dataset**: This dataset is noted for its large-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases. Again, I need to find the full citation.

3. **VinDr-CXR Dataset**: This dataset is described as an open dataset of chest X-rays with radiologist annotations. I will also need to find its full citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CheXpert Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irvin, J., Rajpurkar, P., Ko, M., Yu, Y., Ciurea-Ilcus, S., Chute, C., Marklund, H., Haghgoo, B., Ball, R., Shpanskaya, K., et al. (2019). *Chexpert: A large chest radiograph dataset with uncertainty labels and expert comparison*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pp. 590–597.

- For **ChestX-ray8 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R.M. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 2097–2106.

- For **VinDr-CXR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, H.Q., Lam, K., Le, L.T., Pham, H.H., Tran, D.Q., Nguyen, D.B., Le, D.D., Pham, C.M., Tong, H.T., Dinh, D.H., et al. (2022). *VinDr-CXR: An open dataset of chest X-rays with radiologist’s annotations*. Scientific Data, 9, 429.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
