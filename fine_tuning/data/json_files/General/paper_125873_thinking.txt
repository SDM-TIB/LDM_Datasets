To extract datasets from the research paper titled "mmWave RIS Phase Shift Feedback Based on Knowledge Base Autoencoder Framework" by Hao Feng, Yuting Xu, and Yuping Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a feedback scheme for mmWave RIS phase shifts but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to see if the authors reference any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In the introduction, the authors mention using a channel simulator called **SimRIS** developed by KOC University, which is relevant for generating channel vectors but does not constitute a dataset in the traditional sense.

In the **simulation results section**, the authors describe the parameters used for their simulations, including the number of channel samples generated (72,000) and the optimal RIS phase shifts calculated from channel vectors. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name or a publicly available dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited. The references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and frameworks related to wireless communication and do not list any datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide full citations for any datasets, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **SimRIS Channel Simulator**: While not a dataset, it is a tool used to generate channel vectors for the simulations. The authors reference it in the context of generating optimal phase shifts but do not provide a citation for the simulator itself.

2. **Generated Data**: The authors mention generating 72,000 channel samples and optimal RIS phase shifts, but these are not publicly available datasets.

In conclusion, this paper does not provide any datasets with full citations. The only relevant mention is of the SimRIS simulator, which is used to generate data but is not a dataset itself. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were extracted from this paper.
