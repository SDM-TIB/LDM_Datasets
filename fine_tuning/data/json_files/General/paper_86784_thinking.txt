To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Completeness-Aware Concept-Based Explanations in Deep Neural Networks" by Chih-Kuan Yeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on both a synthetic dataset and real-world image and language datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using a **synthetic dataset** with known ground truth concepts, which consists of 48,000 training samples and 12,000 evaluation samples. This dataset is specifically constructed for evaluating their concept discovery algorithm.

In addition, they refer to the **Animals with Attributes (AwA)** dataset, which contains 26,905 images for training and 2,965 images for evaluation. This dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in a real-world image classification task.

Furthermore, they mention using the **IMDB dataset** for text classification, which consists of 37,500 reviews for training and 12,500 for testing. This dataset is utilized to evaluate their concept discovery method in the context of natural language processing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: Since this dataset is created by the authors for their specific experiments, it does not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset with known ground truth concepts.

2. **Animals with Attributes (AwA)**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Christoph H. Lampert, Hannes Nickisch, and Stefan Harmeling. *Learning to Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer*. In CVPR, 2009.

3. **IMDB Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Alec Radford, Rafal Józefowicz, and Ilya Sutskever. *Learning to Generate Reviews and Discovering Sentiment*. arXiv:1704.01444, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Synthetic Dataset**: A dataset created by the authors for evaluating their concept discovery algorithm, consisting of 48,000 training samples and 12,000 evaluation samples.

- **Animals with Attributes (AwA)**: A dataset used for image classification, containing 26,905 images for training and 2,965 images for evaluation. Citation: Christoph H. Lampert, Hannes Nickisch, and Stefan Harmeling. *Learning to Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer*. In CVPR, 2009.

- **IMDB Dataset**: A dataset for text classification, consisting of 37,500 reviews for training and 12,500 for testing. Citation: Alec Radford, Rafal Józefowicz, and Ilya Sutskever. *Learning to Generate Reviews and Discovering Sentiment*. arXiv:1704.01444, 2017.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
