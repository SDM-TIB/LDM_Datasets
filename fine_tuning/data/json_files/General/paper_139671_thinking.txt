To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Predictive Reliability to Foster Trust in Artificial Intelligence. A case study in Multiple Sclerosis" by Lorenzo Peracchio et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their research and may mention datasets relevant to their study. I will pay attention to any specific datasets that are referenced or described in relation to their methodology.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly subsection 2.3, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: This dataset consists of 6000 samples generated for a binary classification problem, with 800 samples used for training and 300 for validation. The authors explain how this dataset is structured and its purpose in testing their reliability assessment method.

2. **Multiple Sclerosis Dataset**: This dataset is collected from MS patients at Mondino Hospital as part of the BRAINTEASER project. It includes 392 training patients and 68 test patients, focusing on predicting disease progression based on various clinical features. The authors provide details about the preprocessing steps and the specific features included in the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **Simulated Dataset**, since it is generated for the study, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research.

For the **Multiple Sclerosis Dataset**, I will look for the original source or any related publications that describe the dataset in detail. The authors mention a reference to a previous work (Buonocore et al., 2023) that may provide additional context or citation for this dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets where applicable. This will allow for clear documentation of the datasets used in the study and facilitate further research or replication of the work.
