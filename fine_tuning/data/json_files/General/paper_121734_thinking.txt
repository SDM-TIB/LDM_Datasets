To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression" by Zhuoran Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and a **100-class subset of ImageNet**, indicating that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will confirm the details of these datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 4.1). Here, the authors specify that they used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, which is commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but contains 100 classes with 600 images per class, also split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. **ImageNet (100-class subset)**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, which includes images from the first 100 classes of the official ImageNet training set, with 20% of images selected for training and all corresponding images in the validation set for testing.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR (pp. 248â€“255).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. This structured approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research and provide proper citations for each.
