To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kirigami: large convolutional kernels improve deep learning-based RNA secondary structure prediction" by Marc Harary and Chengxin Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a novel model and mention a "widely adopted, standardized test set comprised of 1,305 molecules," which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Results)**, specifically **subsection 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they mention that Kirigami was trained and tested on datasets collected from the bpRNA database. They specify that they collected **13,419 samples** after filtration for non-redundancy, and these samples were divided into training (TR0), validation (VL0), and testing (TS0) sets.

The authors also mention that they used a dataset of approximately **200 molecules** from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for benchmarking past models, but they ultimately decided to use the bpRNA database for their experiments due to the scarcity of high-quality data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **bpRNA Database**: The citation for the bpRNA database is:
   > Danaee, P., Rouches, M., Wiley, M., Deng, D., Huang, L., & Hendrix, D. (2018). bprna: large-scale automated annotation and analysis of RNA secondary structure. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 46(10), 5381-5394.

2. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: The citation for the Protein Data Bank is:
   > Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., Shindyalov, I. N., & Bourne, P. E. (2000). The protein data bank. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 28(1), 235-242.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
