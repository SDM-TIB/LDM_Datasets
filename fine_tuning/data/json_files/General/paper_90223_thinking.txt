To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Scattering Convolution Networks" by Joan Bruna and StÃ©phane Mallat, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications**. The abstract mentions that state-of-the-art classification results are obtained for handwritten digits and texture discrimination, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if any specific datasets are named. The introduction discusses challenges in image classification and mentions the use of datasets for experiments, but I need to look for explicit names.

I will then examine **section 4 (Classification using Scattering Vectors)**, which is likely to contain details about the datasets used for classification tasks. Here, the authors mention two datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely used for handwritten digit recognition and consists of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

2. **USPS Dataset**: This dataset contains 7,291 training samples and 2,007 test images, also for handwritten digit recognition.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results based on these datasets, confirming their use in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- For the **USPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. C. Cohn, M. A. K. and M. A. P. *The USPS Handwritten Digit Database*. 1996. Available: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/usps.zip

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
