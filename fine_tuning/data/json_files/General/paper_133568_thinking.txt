To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Religious Affiliation in the Twenty-First Century: A Machine Learning Perspective on the World Value Survey" by Elaheh Jafarigol et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes data from the **World Value Survey (WVS)**, which is a significant dataset for this research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly focusing on **section 1 (Introduction)** and **section 2 (Analysis)**. In the introduction, the authors describe the WVS as a publicly available dataset that has been collected globally since 1981, which provides a strong foundation for their analysis.

In **section 2.1 (Overview of the Data)**, the authors mention analyzing **440,055 observations** collected from respondents participating in the WVS from **1989 to 2022**. This section provides crucial details about the dataset, including the number of observations and the time frame of the data collection.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the World Value Survey. The citation is as follows:
> Inglehart, R., Haerpfer, C. W., Moreno, A., Welzel, C., Kizilova, K., Diez-Medrano, J., Lagos, M., Norris, P., Ponarin, E., & Puranen, B. (2018). *World Values Survey: All Rounds, Country-Pooled Datafile Version: v2015-04-18*. World Values Survey Association.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference various studies and datasets throughout the text, particularly in the context of their analysis of factors influencing religiosity. However, the primary dataset utilized for their analysis is the WVS.

After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the World Value Survey as it is the main dataset referenced in the study.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
