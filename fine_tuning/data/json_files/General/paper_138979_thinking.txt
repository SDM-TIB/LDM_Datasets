To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Investigating the Impact of Data Contamination of Large Language Models in Text-to-SQL Translation" by Federico Ranaldi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using the **Spider Dataset** and a new dataset called **Termite**. This is a strong indication that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Text-to-SQL Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **Spider Dataset**: The authors describe Spider as the de-facto standard for training and testing systems on the Text-to-SQL task. They mention that it consists of a collection of databases and associated pairs of natural language questions and SQL translations. The dataset is structured with various difficulty levels for the queries.

2. **Termite Dataset**: The authors introduce Termite as a new dataset designed to be a fresh resource for evaluating Text-to-SQL tasks. They explain that it contains hand-crafted databases and a balanced set of natural language to SQL query pairs, aiming to reduce the possibility of performance boosts due to data contamination.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Spider Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tao Yu, Rui Zhang, Kai Yang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Dongxu Wang, Zifan Li, James Ma, Irene Li, Qingning Yao, Shanelle Roman, Zilin Zhang, and Dragomir Radev. *Spider: A large-scale human-labeled dataset for complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 3911â€“3921, Brussels, Belgium, 2018.

- For the **Termite Dataset**, the authors mention that it will be made available under a GPL-3.0 license, but they do not provide a formal citation in the references. However, I can note that it is a new dataset introduced in this paper.

Now, I will compile the extracted information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
