To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing Deep Learning Models for Rice Mapping in Bhutan Using High Resolution Satellite Imagery" by Biplov Bhandari and Timothy Mayer, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "publicly available Norwayâ€™s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI) high resolution satellite imagery from Planet," which indicates that this imagery is a dataset used in the study. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of remote sensing data for crop type mapping, hinting at the datasets utilized.

Next, I will examine the **data and methods** section, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sources, and any relevant details about their content or structure.

In the **data and methods** section, I find the following datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Planet's Satellite Imagery**: This dataset is described as part of the NICFI data program, providing high-resolution satellite imagery optimized for scientific analysis. It includes spectral data in an analysis-ready format.

2. **Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery**: This dataset consists of dual-polarization Ground Range Detected (GRD) scenes from the Sentinel-1 satellite, which is used for crop mapping applications.

3. **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Data**: This dataset provides elevation data that is used in conjunction with the satellite imagery for improved mapping accuracy.

Additionally, the paper mentions the **Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS)** as a weak label approach for capturing different strata, which is also relevant for the study.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **Planet's Satellite Imagery**:
  > Planet Labs. NICFI Satellite Data Program, 2022.

- For **Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery**:
  > European Space Agency (ESA). Sentinel-1 Toolbox - Sentinel Online.

- For **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Data**:
  > Farr, T. G., et al. (2007). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Reviews of Geophysics, 45(2).

- For **Regional Land Cover Monitoring System (RLCMS)**:
  > Uddin, K., et al. (2021). Regional Land Cover Monitoring System for Hindu Kush Himalaya. In Earth Observation Science and Applications for Risk Reduction and Enhanced Resilience in Hindu Kush Himalaya Region.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
