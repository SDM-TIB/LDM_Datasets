To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Visual Interaction Framework for Dimensionality Reduction Based Data Exploration" by Marco Cavallo and Ça˘gatay Demiralp, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and applications sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed framework to PCA and autoencoder-based dimensionality reductions, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **applications section**, where the authors provide specific examples of datasets used in their experiments. They mention three datasets:

1. **OECD Better Life Dataset**: This dataset contains eight numerical socioeconomic development indices of 34 OECD member countries. The authors describe how this dataset is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of their framework in exploratory data analysis.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset consisting of handwritten digits, which is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The authors illustrate how the framework can be applied to this dataset to explore the latent space of the autoencoder.

3. **Google QuickDraw Dataset**: This dataset contains 50 million drawings in 345 different categories. The authors use a subset of this dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of their framework in visualizing and exploring the data.

4. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: This dataset includes images of clothing articles and serves as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset, providing a more challenging classification task.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. 

The citations I will look for are:

- For the **OECD Better Life Dataset**, I will search for the original source or report that describes the dataset.
- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.
  
- For the **Google QuickDraw Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Google. *Quick, Draw!*. https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/. Accessed: [Date].
  
- For the **Fashion MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zalando Research. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

Once I have gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
