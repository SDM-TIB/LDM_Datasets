To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Satellite Imagery Multiscale Rapid Detection with Windowed Networks" by Adam Van Etten, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses challenges in satellite imagery analytics and mentions a pipeline for object detection, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Training Data)**, where the author explicitly describes the datasets used for training. Here, I will find specific datasets mentioned for different object categories:

1. **Cars Overhead with Context (COWC)**: This dataset is described as a large, high-quality set of annotated cars from overhead imagery collected via aerial platforms. It includes 13,303 labeled training cars.

2. **DigitalGlobe Images**: The paper mentions labeled DigitalGlobe images over airports, totaling 230 objects in the training set for airplanes.

3. **DigitalGlobe Images for Boats**: The author notes that three DigitalGlobe images taken over coastal regions were labeled, resulting in a total of 556 boats.

4. **Planet Images for Airports**: The dataset for airports consists of 37 Planet images, each containing a single airport per 5000m chip.

Additionally, the author mentions the **SpaceNet dataset** as a potential source for building footprints, which could be relevant for future work.

After identifying these datasets, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for each dataset:

- For **COWC**, the citation is:
  > T. N. Mundhenk, G. Konjevod, W. A. Sakla, and K. Boakye. *A large contextual dataset for classification, detection and counting of cars with deep learning*. CoRR, abs/1609.04453, 2016.

- For **DigitalGlobe images**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is implied that these are proprietary datasets from DigitalGlobe.

- For **Planet images**, similar to DigitalGlobe, the citation is not explicitly provided, but it refers to imagery from Planet Labs.

- For **SpaceNet**, the citation is:
  > SpaceNet. *SpaceNet Dataset*. Available at: https://spacenetchallenge.github.io/

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
