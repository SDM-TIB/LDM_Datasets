To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LCD â€“ Line Clustering and Description for Place Recognition" by Felix Taubner et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using data obtained from the **InteriorNet dataset** for training their neural network. This indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments on three datasets: **InteriorNet**, **DIML**, and **NYU**. They provide details about how each dataset is used for evaluating their place recognition method, which confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather specific details about each dataset:

1. **InteriorNet Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of more than 10,000 scenes with 20 photo-realistic RGB-D frames each from random viewpoints. This dataset is used for training their model.

2. **DIML Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing a large number of real indoor and outdoor scenes, but they only use indoor scenes for their experiments. They selected 30 scenes with 8 frames each for evaluation.

3. **NYU Dataset**: The authors refer to the NYU Depth Dataset V2, which includes a variety of indoor scenes captured using the Microsoft Kinect V1 sensor. They mention using a labeled subset of this dataset for their experiments.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **InteriorNet dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, W., Saeedi, S., McCormac, J., Clark, R., Tzoumanikas, D., Ye, Q., Huang, Y., Tang, R., & Leutenegger, S. (2018). *InteriorNet: Mega-scale multi-sensor photo-realistic indoor scenes dataset*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC).

- For the **DIML dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cho, J., Min, D., Kim, Y., & Sohn, K. (2019). *A large RGB-D dataset for semi-supervised monocular depth estimation*. CoRR, abs/1904.10230.

- For the **NYU dataset**, the citation is:
  > Silberman, N., Hoiem, D., & Fergus, R. (2012). *Indoor segmentation and support inference from RGBD images*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its respective citation.
