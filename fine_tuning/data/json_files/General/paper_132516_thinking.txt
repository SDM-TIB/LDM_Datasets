To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Log-Concavity: Theory and Algorithm for Sum-Log-Concave Optimization" by Mastane Achab, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Methodology," or "Applications."** In these sections, authors usually describe the datasets used for validation or testing their proposed methods. 

As I read through these sections, I will take note of any datasets explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or specific characteristics that define them.

If the paper includes a **"References" section,"** I will check for citations related to the datasets. This is crucial because I need to provide full citations for each dataset. I will look for papers or reports that describe the datasets in detail, as these citations will serve as authoritative references.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for the original paper that introduced it, which is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes the name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before finalizing the dataset entries for further processing or presentation.
