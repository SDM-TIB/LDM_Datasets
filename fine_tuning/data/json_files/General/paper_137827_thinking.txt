To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Momentum-SAM: Sharpness Aware Minimization Without Computational Overhead" by Frederick Altrock et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and its significance, while the introduction often outlines the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their evaluation of the Momentum-SAM (MSAM) algorithm on various benchmarks, which is a strong indication that datasets will be mentioned.

Upon examining the **experiments section**, I will look for specific names of datasets used in the evaluations. The authors typically provide details about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **CIFAR-100 dataset**, I will find the citation for it, which is typically formatted as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

If the paper also mentions the **ImageNet dataset**, I will locate its citation:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 248â€“255, 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
