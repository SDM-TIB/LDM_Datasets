To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Combining Primal and Dual Representations in Deep Restricted Kernel Machines Classifiers" by Francesco Tonin, Panagiotis Patrinos, and Johan A. K. Suykens, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context of the research and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets in Table 1, which lists the datasets tested, including MNIST, ARCENE, Sonar, Protein, RCV1, and IMDB. Each dataset is accompanied by details such as the number of training instances, input dimensions, and the number of classes.

I will then look for the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

For the datasets mentioned in the paper, I will compile the following citations:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > LeCun, Y., Cortes, C., Burges, C. (2010). *MNIST handwritten digit database*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist.

2. **ARCENE Dataset**:
   > Guyon, I., Gunn, S.R., Ben-Hur, A., Dror, G. (2004). *Result Analysis of the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge*. In: NeurIPS.

3. **Sonar Dataset**:
   > No specific citation provided in the paper; it is commonly known as the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

4. **Protein Dataset**:
   > No specific citation provided in the paper; it is commonly known as the Protein dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

5. **RCV1 Dataset**:
   > Lewis, D.D., Yang, Y., Rose, T.G., Li, F. (2004). *RCV1: A New Benchmark Collection for Text Categorization Research*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, 361-397.

6. **IMDB Dataset**:
   > No specific citation provided in the paper; it is commonly known as the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately represented each dataset's details and citations. This will allow me to create a structured output that includes all necessary information for each dataset, ready for further processing or review.
