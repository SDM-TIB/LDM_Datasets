To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DSNAS: Direct Neural Architecture Search without Parameter Retraining" by Shoukang Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the motivation behind their work and may reference specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for phrases that indicate the use of datasets, such as "we evaluated our method on..." or "the experiments were conducted using...".

Moving on to the **experimental results section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its size and the specific task it is used for (image classification).

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For the ImageNet dataset, I will look for the original paper that describes it to ensure I have the correct citation.

The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the dataset name, description, and citation, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
