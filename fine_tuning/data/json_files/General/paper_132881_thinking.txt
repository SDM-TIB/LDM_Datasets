To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prompting and Adapter Tuning for Self-Supervised Encoder-Decoder Speech Model" by Kai-Wei Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of prompting and adapter tuning techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide a summary of the downstream tasks and datasets involved in their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Speech Commands Dataset**: Used for keyword spotting tasks.
2. **Fluent Commands Dataset**: Used for intent classification tasks.
3. **LibriSpeech-100 hr Dataset**: Used for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with 100 hours of data.
4. **LibriLight-10 hr Dataset**: Used for ASR in a low-resource scenario with 10 hours of data.
5. **Audio SNIPS Dataset**: Used for slot filling tasks.
6. **Multilingual LibriSpeech Dataset**: Used for multilingual ASR tasks.

I will then verify the details of these datasets in the **method section** and **results section** to ensure they are accurately represented and confirm their relevance to the experiments conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **Speech Commands Dataset**:

- For **Fluent Commands Dataset**:
  > Loren Lugosch et al., “Speech model pre-training for end-to-end spoken language understanding,” in INTERSPEECH, 2019, pp. 814–818.

  > Vassil Panayotov et al., “Librispeech: An ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in ICASSP, 2015, pp. 5206–5210.

- For **LibriLight-10 hr Dataset**:
  > J. Kahn et al., “Libri-light: A benchmark for ASR with limited or no supervision,” in ICASSP, 2020, pp. 7669–7673.

- For **Audio SNIPS Dataset**:
  > Cheng-I Lai et al., “Semi-supervised spoken language understanding via self-supervised speech and language model pretraining,” in ICASSP, 2021, pp. 7468–7472.

- For **Multilingual LibriSpeech Dataset**:
  > Vineel Pratap et al., “MLS: A large-scale multilingual dataset for speech research,” in INTERSPEECH, 2020, pp. 2757–2761.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
