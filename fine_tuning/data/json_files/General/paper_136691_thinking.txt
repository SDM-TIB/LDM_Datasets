To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Critic-Guided Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning" by Yuanfu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract mentions empirical evaluations on **D4RL benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant sections that discuss the datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the datasets are likely to be mentioned in the **Experiments** section, where the authors describe their methodology and the environments they tested their approach on.

Upon reviewing the **Experiments** section, I find that the authors evaluate their method on various D4RL benchmark datasets, specifically mentioning environments such as **Halfcheetah**, **Hopper**, and **Walker2d**. They also refer to different dataset qualities: **Medium**, **Medium-Replay**, and **Medium-Expert**.

I will now compile the details of the datasets mentioned:

1. **D4RL Halfcheetah Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method in the Halfcheetah environment. The authors mention using the Medium, Medium-Replay, and Medium-Expert versions of this dataset.

2. **D4RL Hopper Dataset**: Similar to Halfcheetah, this dataset is used in the Hopper environment, with the same three versions (Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert).

3. **D4RL Walker2d Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Walker2d environment, also with Medium, Medium-Replay, and Medium-Expert versions.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the D4RL datasets. The D4RL benchmark datasets are typically cited from the original paper that introduced them:

- For the D4RL benchmark datasets, the citation is:
  > Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:2004.07219.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **D4RL Halfcheetah Dataset** (Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert)
   - Citation: Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:2004.07219.

2. **D4RL Hopper Dataset** (Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert)
   - Citation: Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:2004.07219.

3. **D4RL Walker2d Dataset** (Medium, Medium-Replay, Medium-Expert)
   - Citation: Fu, J., Kumar, A., Nachum, O., Tucker, G., & Levine, S. (2020). D4RL: Datasets for Deep Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning. arXiv:2004.07219.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
