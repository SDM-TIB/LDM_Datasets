To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ABCP: Automatic Block-wise and Channel-wise Network Pruning via Joint Search" by Jiaqi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors tested their method on three datasets, which indicates that I should look for specific names and details of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors briefly discuss the datasets used for their experiments, hinting at their significance in evaluating the proposed method. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection that discusses the datasets. Here, the authors explicitly list the three datasets used:

1. **UCSD Dataset**: This dataset is described as being captured from freeway surveillance videos, containing images of vehicles (truck, car, bus) with a resolution of 320x240. The training set consists of 683 images, and the testing set has 76 images.

2. **Mobile Robot Detection Dataset**: This dataset is collected using robot-mounted cameras, featuring five classes of robots with varying resolutions (1024x512 and 640x480). The training set contains 13,914 images, while the testing set has 5,969 images.

3. **Sim2Real Detection Dataset**: This dataset is divided into two parts: a simulation dataset and a real-world dataset, both containing images of robots with a resolution of 640x480. The training set for the simulation dataset has 5,760 images, and the testing set has 1,440 images, while the real-world dataset has 3,019 images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **UCSD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chan, A. B., & Vasconcelos, N. (2008). Modeling, clustering, and segmenting video with mixtures of dynamic textures. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 30(5), 909-926.

- For the **Mobile Robot Detection Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Sim2Real Detection Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
