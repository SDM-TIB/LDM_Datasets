To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bidirectional Progressive Transformer for Interaction Intention Anticipation" by Zichen Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets: **Epic-Kitchens-100**, **EGO4D**, and **EGTEA Gaze+**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research and should be examined further.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They explicitly list the three datasets and provide some context about their content and focus. Hereâ€™s what I find:

1. **Epic-Kitchens-100**: This dataset is primarily focused on kitchen scenes and is used for predicting hand trajectories and interaction hotspots in egocentric videos.

2. **EGO4D**: This dataset encompasses a broader range of activities, including handicrafts, painting, and outdoor tasks, also used for similar prediction tasks.

3. **EGTEA Gaze+**: Like Epic-Kitchens-100, this dataset also includes kitchen scenes and is utilized for the same predictive modeling tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **Epic-Kitchens-100**, the citation is:
  > Damen, D., Doughty, H., Farinella, G.M., Fidler, S., Furnari, A., Kazakos, E., Moltisanti, D., Munro, J., Perrett, T., Price, W., Wray, M. (2018). *Scaling egocentric vision: The epic-kitchens dataset*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For **EGO4D**, the citation is:
  > Grauman, K., Westbury, A., Byrne, E., Chavis, Z., Furnari, A., Girdhar, R., Hamburger, J., Jiang, H., Liu, M., Liu, X., et al. (2022). *Ego4d: Around the world in 3,000 hours of egocentric video*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

- For **EGTEA Gaze+**, the citation is:
  > Liu, S., Tripathi, S., Majumdar, S., Wang, X. (2022). *Joint hand motion and interaction hotspots prediction from egocentric videos*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined along with its full citation for future reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
