To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation for Mental Health Classification on Social Media" by Gunjan Ansari et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two publicly available social media datasets for their experiments, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results and Evaluation)**, particularly the **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Dreaddit Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying stressful posts from casual conversations. It consists of 3,553 manually labeled Reddit posts across five categories. The authors provide statistics on the dataset, including the number of training and testing samples.

2. **SDCNL Dataset**: This dataset is scraped from Reddit and is used for classifying posts related to clinical depression and suicidal tendencies. It contains 1,517 training samples and 379 testing samples, with specific statistics on the distribution of depression and suicide-related posts.

After identifying the datasets, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Dreaddit Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Elsbeth Turcan and Kathleen McKeown. *Dreaddit: A Reddit Dataset for Stress Analysis in Social Media*. In LOUHI@EMNLP, 2019.

- For the **SDCNL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ayaan Haque, Viraaj Reddi, and Tyler Giallanza. *Deep Learning for Suicide and Depression Identification with Unsupervised Label Correction*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.09427, 2021.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
