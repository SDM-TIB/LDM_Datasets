To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Paraphrase Generation Using Pre-Trained Language Models" by Chaitra Hegde and Shrikumar Patil, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **Quora Question Pair (QQP) dataset** for training and evaluation, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They mention the **Quora Question Pair (QQP) dataset**, describing it as having 400,000 labeled examples, including 140,000 actual paraphrases and 300,000 unlabeled sentence pairs. This section also specifies how they selected a subset of 30,000 sentence pairs for testing, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's application in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention using the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** dataset for demonstrating the effectiveness of paraphrases in data augmentation. This dataset has 6,920 training examples and 1,821 test examples, which I will also note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Quora Question Pair (QQP) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. *Quora Question Pairs*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs.

- For the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631â€“1642, Seattle, Washington, USA, October 2013. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
