To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Masked Autoencoders with Multi-Window Local-Global Attention Are Better Audio Learners" by Sarthak Yadav et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions empirical results on "ten downstream audio tasks," which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets or references to them in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Tasks)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used for pre-training and downstream tasks. Here, they mention the **AudioSet dataset** for pre-training, which is described as having over 5000 hours of audio data distributed in 2 million weakly annotated YouTube clips spanning 527 classes. This is a significant dataset, and I will need to note its details.

In addition, the authors refer to a subset of the **HEAR benchmark**, which consists of ten diverse tasks spanning multiple domains. I will need to identify the specific datasets associated with these tasks, as they are likely to be important for downstream evaluations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citation for the **AudioSet dataset** is as follows:
- Gemmeke, J. F., Ellis, D. P., Freedman, A., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, R. C., Plakal, M., & Ritter, M. (2017). Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events. In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 776â€“780). IEEE.

For the HEAR benchmark tasks, I will need to look for specific references in the paper that detail the datasets used for each task. The authors mention various tasks such as **Beijing Opera**, **Crema-D**, **ESC-50**, **LibriCount**, and others, which may correspond to specific datasets. I will extract their citations from the references as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help me ensure that I do not miss any important details and that I provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
