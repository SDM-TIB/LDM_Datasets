To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-Preserving Image Classification Using Isotropic Network" by AprilPyone MaungMaung and Hitoshi Kiya, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. In this paper, they mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **Imagenette**. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the CIFAR-10 dataset, stating that it consists of 60,000 color images divided into 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. They also mention that Imagenette is a subset of ImageNet, containing 13,394 color images with a 70/30 training/validation split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. University of Toronto, Tech. Rep., 2009.

2. For **Imagenette**, the citation is:
   > Jeremy Howard. *A Smaller Subset of 10 Easily Classified Classes from ImageNet, and a Little More French*. 2019. Available: https://github.com/fastai/imagenette.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
