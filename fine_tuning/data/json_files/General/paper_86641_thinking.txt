To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Test for Shared Patterns in Cross-modal Brain Activation Analysis" by Elena Kalinina et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **synthetic datasets** and an **fMRI dataset**, which indicates that these are the datasets I need to focus on.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **Methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I find two main datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors describe how they constructed a synthetic dataset based on a model that includes modality-specific effects, condition-specific effects, and Gaussian noise. They generated a total of 20 different images across three versions of this dataset, varying in the number of voxels (10, 100, and 1000). However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this synthetic dataset since it is generated by the authors.

2. **fMRI Dataset**: The authors conducted an empirical analysis using fMRI data collected from 24 participants in a visual attention study. They describe the experimental design, participant demographics, and the specific tasks performed. The details about the dataset are comprehensive, but I need to find the citation for the original source of the fMRI data. The authors refer to a study that illustrates the design of their experiment, which is cited in the references.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the fMRI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the fMRI dataset, the citation is:
  > Peelen, M. V., Fei-Fei, L., & Kastner, S. (2009). Neural mechanisms of rapid natural scene categorization in human visual cortex. *Nature*, 460, 94â€“97. DOI: 10.1038/nature08184.

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is generated by the authors for the purposes of this study.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the full citation for the fMRI dataset and noting the synthetic dataset's origin. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
