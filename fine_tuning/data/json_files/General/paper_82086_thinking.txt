To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale calibration for high-dimensional robust regression" by Po-Ling Loh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors typically describe the experiments conducted and the datasets employed. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, features, or any preprocessing steps mentioned.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any additional information about the datasets used in the experiments, including performance metrics or comparisons that might indicate the datasets' relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For each dataset identified, I will document the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief summary of what the dataset contains, including the number of samples, features, and any specific characteristics.
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, as found in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.
