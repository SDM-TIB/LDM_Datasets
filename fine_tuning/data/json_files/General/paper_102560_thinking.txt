To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subjective Image Quality Assessment with Boosted Triplet Comparisons" by Hui Men et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract**, **introduction**, and **experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract mentions a new dataset called **KonFiG-IQA**, which is a good starting point.

2. **Identifying Datasets**: In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for annotated image datasets for training FR-IQA algorithms. They mention that their study contributes a new dataset, **KonFiG-IQA**, which contains 10 source images processed with 7 distortion types at various levels. This indicates that there are specific datasets to extract.

3. **Datasets Section**: I will look for a dedicated section that discusses datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors provide a table (Table I) that lists various IQA/VQA/JND datasets, including their characteristics. I will extract the relevant datasets from this table.

4. **Full Citations**: For each dataset mentioned, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations. The paper lists several datasets, including:
   - **KonFiG-IQA**: This is the primary dataset introduced in the paper.
   - **TID2008**: A well-known dataset for image quality assessment.
   - **TID2013**: An updated version of TID2008.
   - **KADID-10k**: A crowdsourced dataset for image quality assessment.
   - **MCL-JCI**: A dataset for just noticeable difference assessments.

5. **Compiling Information**: I will compile the information for each dataset, including:
   - **Name**: The name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains and its purpose.
   - **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references.

6. **Final Review**: After compiling the datasets and their citations, I will review the information to ensure accuracy and completeness.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the datasets from the paper effectively and document them with the necessary citations.
