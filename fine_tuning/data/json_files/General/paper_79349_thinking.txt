To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incremental Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction for Online Subspace Pattern Classification" by Hamid Abrishami Moghaddam and Elaheh Raisi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is implemented on several datasets, including "a number of UCI datasets and Indian Pine dataset." This suggests that there are specific datasets that I need to find.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using "some datasets of UCI database" and "Indian Pine dataset." I will need to gather more details about these datasets.

In the paper, they provide a summary of the UCI datasets in **Table 2**, which lists eight datasets with their respective properties. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Sonar Dataset (S1)**: 2 classes, 60 original dimensions, 208 samples.
2. **Liver Dataset (S2)**: 2 classes, 6 original dimensions, 345 samples.
3. **Iris Dataset (S3)**: 3 classes, 4 original dimensions, 150 samples.
4. **Wine Dataset (S4)**: 3 classes, 13 original dimensions, 178 samples.
5. **Vehicle Dataset (S5)**: 4 classes, 18 original dimensions, 846 samples.
6. **Glass Dataset (S6)**: 6 classes, 9 original dimensions, 214 samples.
7. **Segmentation Dataset (S7)**: 7 classes, 19 original dimensions, 2310 samples.
8. **Vowel Dataset (S8)**: 11 classes, 10 original dimensions, 528 samples.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Indian Pine dataset** in the context of remote sensing hyperspectral images, which is used for classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The UCI datasets are typically referenced as follows:

- For the UCI datasets, the citation is:
  > Blake, C., & Merz, C. (1998). UCI repository of machine learning databases. Retrieved from http://www.ics.uci.edu/mlearn/MLRepository.html

- For the **Indian Pine dataset**, the citation is:
  > [Online]. Available: ftp://ftp.ecn.purdue.edu/biehl/MultiSpec/

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
