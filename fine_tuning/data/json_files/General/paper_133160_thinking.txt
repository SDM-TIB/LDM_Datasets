To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated clinical coding using off-the-shelf large language models" by Joseph S. Boyle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of the **CodiEsp dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they are using the **CodiEsp dataset** for their evaluations. The description indicates that this dataset consists of 1000 span-level expert-annotated case notes in Spanish, along with machine-translated English versions, and that they evaluate on the competition test set.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CodiEsp dataset**. The authors reference a paper that provides an overview of the CodiEsp dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the **CodiEsp dataset** is:
> A. Miranda-Escalada, A. Gonzalez-Agirre, J. Armengol-Estape, and M. Krallinger. *Overview of automatic clinical coding: annotations, guidelines, and solutions for non-English clinical cases at CodiEsp track of CLEF eHealth 2020*. CLEF, Sept. 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **CodiEsp dataset** as it is essential for proper attribution.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
