To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mission Statements in Universities: Readability and Performance" by Julián David Cortés-Sánchez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on mission statements (MS) and their readability, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology section** where the authors describe their data collection process. In section 3.1.1, they mention using the **Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking (QS-WUR)** to identify universities' mission statements for analysis. This indicates that the QS-WUR is a dataset used in their research.

I will also check for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and discussion sections**. The authors refer to the **SCImago Institutions Rankings (S-IR)** as another dataset used to measure university performance. This is crucial as it provides a comparative analysis alongside the QS-WUR.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references section** of the paper:

1. **Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking (QS-WUR)**:
   > Quacquarelli Symonds World University Ranking [QS-WUR] (2019). QS World University Rankings – Methodology. Retrieved from https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings/methodology.

2. **SCImago Institutions Rankings (S-IR)**:
   > Bornmann, L., De Moya Anegón, F., & Leydesdorff, L. (2012). The new excellence indicator in the world report of the SCImago Institutions Rankings 2011. *Journal of Informetrics*, 6, 333–335. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joi.2011.11.006.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the key details for each dataset, including their purpose and relevance to the study. 

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
