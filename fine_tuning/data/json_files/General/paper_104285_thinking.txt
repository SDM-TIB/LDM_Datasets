To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning of Inter-Label Geometric Relationships Using Self-Supervised Learning: Application To Gleason Grade Segmentation" by Dwarikanath Mahapatra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on multiple histopathology datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the author describes the datasets used. In this section, the author mentions the use of the **Gleason grading challenge dataset**. The description states that this dataset consists of 333 Tissue Microarrays (TMAs) from 231 patients, which were annotated by pathologists. This is a clear identification of a dataset relevant to the research.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Gleason grading challenge dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Gleason grading challenge dataset. "Gleason grading challenge dataset." Available at: https://gleason2019.grand-challenge.org/Home (accessed: 2020-01-30).

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The author references the **GlaS segmentation challenge dataset** and the **CAMELYON16 dataset** in the context of their experiments. I will extract the relevant details for these datasets as well.

For the **GlaS segmentation challenge dataset**, the citation is:
> Sirinukunwattana, K., et al. "Gland segmentation in colon histology images: The GlaS challenge contest." *Medical Image Analysis*, vol. 35, pp. 489–502, 2017.

For the **CAMELYON16 dataset**, the citation is:
> Bejnordi, B. E., et al. "Diagnostic Assessment of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Women With Breast Cancer." *JAMA*, vol. 318, no. 22, pp. 2199–2210, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
