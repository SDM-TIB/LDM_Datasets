To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint BS Selection, User Association, and Beamforming Design for Network Integrated Sensing and Communication" by Yiming Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to find specific details about the datasets used in the simulations. This section typically contains information about the parameters, configurations, and datasets that were employed to validate the proposed methods.

In this paper, the authors mention simulation parameters in **Table I**, which outlines various system parameters but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will look for any references to datasets in the **results section** or any figures that may indicate the datasets used for comparison with baseline schemes.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in the main text, I will check the **References section** for any cited works that may describe datasets used in previous studies. This is crucial because the authors may have utilized existing datasets from other research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset mentioned. If the datasets are original contributions of the authors, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors used a dataset from a previous study, I will provide the citation in the following format:
- For a dataset from a previous paper, I will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will include details such as the dataset name, purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that the citations are complete and accurate for each dataset identified in the paper.
