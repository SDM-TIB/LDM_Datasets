To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BYOL works even without batch statistics" by Pierre H. Richemond et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often hints at the data used for experiments. The introduction typically elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss experimental results, as they often detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets in the sections I have read. However, they refer to the **ImageNet** dataset in the context of evaluating their method. This is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision, and it is crucial to include it in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **ImageNet** dataset from the **References section**. The citation is as follows:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the BYOL method and its performance on ImageNet, I will conclude that this is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

Finally, I will compile the extracted dataset information, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet dataset as required. This will allow for a clear and comprehensive representation of the datasets referenced in the paper.
