To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VirtualFlow: Decoupling Deep Learning Models from the Underlying Hardware" by Andrew Or et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the paper for specific dataset details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any sections that mention datasets used for evaluation or training, particularly in the context of the experiments conducted.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention several datasets in the context of their experiments:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks. It is widely recognized in the deep learning community and serves as a benchmark for various models.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning and computer vision algorithms.

3. **GLUE**: A benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding systems, which includes multiple datasets for various tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 22nd IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Convolutional Deep Belief Networks on CIFAR-10*. 2012.

- For **GLUE**, the citation is:
  > Alex Wang, Amanpreet Singh, Julian Michael, Felix Hill, Omer Levy, and Samuel R. Bowman. *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*. In 7th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
