To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Ability of ChatGPT and GPT-4" by Hanmeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text, ensuring to include full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions several logical reasoning datasets, including **LogiQA**, **ReClor**, and **AR-LSAT**, which indicates that these datasets are significant to the research.

Next, I will delve into **section 2.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will identify each dataset, its purpose, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

1. **LogiQA**: This dataset is specifically designed for multi-choice question-answering tasks involving logical reasoning. It is derived from the Chinese Civil Service Examination and has been translated into English. The authors mention that they used the test sets of both the Chinese and English versions for evaluation.

2. **ReClor**: This dataset is focused on reading comprehension tasks that require logical reasoning. It consists of question-answering examples sourced from LSAT exams, and the authors used the development set for their testing.

3. **AR-LSAT**: This is a newly released dataset of analytical reasoning questions from the Law School Admission Test, containing 2064 questions across various reasoning game types. The authors note that this dataset was released in 2022.

4. **ConTRoL**: This dataset investigates contextual reasoning under the natural language inference (NLI) framework, with a significant portion of its pairs categorized under logical reasoning.

5. **MED** and **HELP**: These two datasets focus on monotonicity reasoning, which is a key concept in Natural Logic. They are generated through monotonicity rules and specifically investigate monotonicity-related inference.

6. **ConjNLI**: This dataset serves as a stress test for NLI over conjunctive sentences, where premise-hypothesis pairs are created by manipulating conjunctive sentences.

7. **TaxiNLI**: This dataset is a re-annotated version of the MNLI dataset, focusing on fine-grained category labels, including logical categories.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
