To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Holistic Linear Regression" by Dimitris Bertsimas and Michael Lingzhi Li, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions computational results on real and synthetic datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. 

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss their algorithm's performance on various datasets, which suggests that they may list these datasets explicitly in the subsequent sections.

In the **experiments section**, I will focus on identifying any datasets used for computational results. The authors mention using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a significant clue. I will look for a dedicated section or table that lists these datasets along with their characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their framework on five datasets: 

1. **Airfoil**: This dataset contains 1502 samples and 5 features.
2. **Cancer**: This dataset has 568 samples and 29 features.
3. **Parkinsons**: This dataset consists of 5875 samples and 16 features.
4. **Air Quality**: This dataset includes 9358 samples and 12 features.
5. **Crime**: This dataset has 2215 samples and 125 features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source for these datasets, which is a common practice in research papers.

The citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository is:
> Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the UCI Machine Learning Repository as the source for all datasets mentioned.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective characteristics and the citation is properly formatted.
