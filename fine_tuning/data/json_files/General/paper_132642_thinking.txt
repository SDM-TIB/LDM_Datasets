To extract datasets from the research paper titled "T1/T2 relaxation temporal modelling from accelerated acquisitions using a Latent Transformer" by Fanwen Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset from the MICCAI 2023 CMRxRecon training dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset involved in the research.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. They mention using both single and multi-coil T1 and T2 mapping data from the MICCAI 2023 CMRxRecon training dataset. This section provides details about how the data was acquired, including the specific sequences used and the number of subjects involved.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MICCAI 2023 CMRxRecon training dataset. The reference is listed as follows:
> Wang, C., Lyu, J., Wang, S., Qin, C., Guo, K., Zhang, X., Yu, X., Li, Y., Wang, F., Jin, J., Shi, Z., Xu, Z., Tian, Y., Hua, S., Chen, Z., Liu, M., Sun, M., Kuang, X., Wang, K., Wang, H., Li, H., Chu, Y., Yang, G., Bai, W., Zhuang, X., Wang, H., Qin, J., Qu, X. *CMRxRecon: An open cardiac MRI dataset for the competition of accelerated image reconstruction*. In Proceedings of the MICCAI Conference, 2023.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset Name**: MICCAI 2023 CMRxRecon training dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset includes both single and multi-coil T1 and T2 mapping data acquired from 120 healthy subjects. The data was collected using specific MRI sequences designed for cardiac imaging.
   - **Full Citation**: Wang, C., Lyu, J., Wang, S., Qin, C., Guo, K., Zhang, X., Yu, X., Li, Y., Wang, F., Jin, J., Shi, Z., Xu, Z., Tian, Y., Hua, S., Chen, Z., Liu, M., Sun, M., Kuang, X., Wang, K., Wang, H., Li, H., Chu, Y., Yang, G., Bai, W., Zhuang, X., Wang, H., Qin, J., Qu, X. *CMRxRecon: An open cardiac MRI dataset for the competition of accelerated image reconstruction*. In Proceedings of the MICCAI Conference, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for the dataset used in the research.
