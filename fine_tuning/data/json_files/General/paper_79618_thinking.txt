To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Predictive Image Registration" by Xiao Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method on the **OASIS brain image dataset** in both 2D and 3D, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using the **OASIS longitudinal dataset** for their 2D and 3D image experiments. They specify that they used the first scan of all subjects, resulting in 150 images, and that the 2D slices were extracted from the same axial slice of the 3D images after affine registration. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides additional context about its use.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OASIS dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **OASIS Dataset**: 
  > Marcus, D.S., Wang, T.H., Parker, J., Csernansky, J.G., Morris, J.C., Buckner, R.L. *Open access series of imaging studies (OASIS): Cross-sectional MRI data in young, middle aged, nondemented, and demented older adults*. J. Cognitive Neurosci. 19(9), 1498â€“1507, 2007.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the OASIS dataset, I will ensure to highlight this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included and that the description accurately reflects the details provided in the paper. This will ensure that the dataset extraction is thorough and well-documented for future reference or analysis.
