To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Filter Pruning for Efficient Neural Networks" by Lucas Liebenwein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the experiments and may mention specific datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe their experimental setup in detail, including the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In the **experimental setup section (4.1)**, the authors mention using several datasets for their evaluations. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of tasks, or specific characteristics that define each dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will find the citation that corresponds to it, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is clearly organized and ready for presentation or further processing, maintaining a focus on accuracy and completeness in the dataset documentation.
