To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Systematic Comparison Study on Hyperparameter Optimisation of Graph Neural Networks for Molecular Property Prediction" by Yingfang Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on several benchmarks in MoleculeNet, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Investigation)**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, they explicitly mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **ESOL Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,128 records and is used for predicting water solubility.
2. **FreeSolv Dataset**: This dataset consists of 642 records and is used for predicting hydration free energy.
3. **Lipophilicity Dataset**: This dataset has 4,200 records and is used for predicting the octanol/water distribution coefficient.

The authors also mention that these datasets are from MoleculeNet, which is a significant detail that I need to note.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper states that all data used in their experiments are publicly available in MoleculeNet, which is referenced as follows:

- For **MoleculeNet**, the citation is:
  > Zhenqin Wu, Bharath Ramsundar, Evan N Feinberg, Joseph Gomes, Caleb Geniesse, Aneesh S Pappu, Karl Leswing, and Vijay Pande. *MoleculeNet: a benchmark for molecular machine learning*. Chemical Science, 9(2):513â€“530, 2018. 

Since the datasets are part of the MoleculeNet benchmark, this citation will serve as the authoritative reference for all three datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation for MoleculeNet as the source of the datasets. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
