To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Residual Networks Behave Like Boosting Algorithms" by Chapman Siu, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed methods on multiple benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the author describes the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the author mentions using datasets from the UCI repository, specifically listing them as follows:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks and contains demographic information.
2. **Covertype Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting forest cover types based on cartographic variables.
3. **Landsat Satellite Dataset**: This dataset is used for land cover classification based on satellite imagery.
4. **Glass Identification Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying different types of glass based on chemical composition.
5. **Mandelon Dataset**: This dataset is used for classification tasks and is derived from a variety of sources.
6. **Soybean Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying different types of soybean plants based on various features.
7. **Yeast Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying yeast species based on gene expression data.
8. **Letter Recognition Dataset**: This dataset is used for recognizing letters based on pixel data from images.
9. **Shuttle Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying shuttle launches based on telemetry data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the experiments.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
