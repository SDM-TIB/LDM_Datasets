To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization Indexes for Knowledge Distillation" by Liyong Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **LibriSpeech clean-100 hour**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4.1 (Datasets and Model)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that the **LibriSpeech ASR corpus** was used for all experiments. They mention that the full dataset contains 960 hours of transcribed audio and that the "train clean 10" subset was specifically used for comparison with other baseline models and hyper-parameter tuning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **LibriSpeech dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **LibriSpeech ASR corpus**:
  > Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey, and Sanjeev Khudanpur. *LibriSpeech: An ASR Corpus Based on Public Domain Audio Books*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5206â€“5210, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the **LibriSpeech ASR corpus** is the only dataset used in this research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details about the dataset used in the study.
