To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Information-Theoretic Approach to Personalized Explainable Machine Learning" by Alexander Jung and Pedro H. J. Nardelli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of explainable machine learning but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors describe their application of the proposed algorithm. Here, they mention using a dataset consisting of square patches of a greyscale aerial photograph of the Helsinki city area. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, and I need to gather more details about it.

In the experiments section, the authors refer to the dataset as being freely available via an online map service. I will note this information as it is crucial for the dataset citation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations related to the dataset used in the experiments. However, the references primarily focus on the theoretical aspects and previous works in machine learning and explainability, rather than specific datasets.

Since the paper mentions that the data is available via an online map service, I will include that in my dataset description. The specific citation for the dataset is not provided in the references, but I can still document the source of the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset**: Aerial photographs of Helsinki city area
  - **Description**: The dataset consists of square patches of greyscale aerial photographs used for predicting the greyscale value of the center pixel.
  - **Source**: Available via the online map service at https://kartta.hel.fi/

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that I include the source link for reference.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation.
