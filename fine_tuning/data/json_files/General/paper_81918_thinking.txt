To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Compositional Coding Capsule Network with K-Means Routing for Text Classification" by Hao Ren and Hong Lu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on **eight challenging text classification datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they used publicly available datasets from Zhang et al. [14] to evaluate their model. This is a clear indication that the datasets will be listed here.

Within **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, the authors enumerate the datasets as follows:

1. **AG's News (AG's.N)**: A dataset for news categorization with 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples.
2. **DBPedia**: A dataset derived from Wikipedia, containing 560,000 training samples and 70,000 test samples.
3. **Yahoo! Answers (Yahoo!.A)**: A dataset with 1,400,000 training samples and 60,000 test samples.
4. **Sogou News (Sogou.N)**: A dataset with 450,000 training samples and 60,000 test samples.
5. **Yelp Review Polarity (Yelp.P)**: A dataset with 560,000 training samples and 38,000 test samples.
6. **Yelp Review Full (Yelp.F)**: A dataset with 650,000 training samples and 50,000 test samples.
7. **Amazon Review Polarity (Amazon.P)**: A dataset with 3,600,000 training samples and 400,000 test samples.
8. **Amazon Review Full (Amazon.F)**: A dataset with 3,000,000 training samples and 650,000 test samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference Zhang et al. [14] for the datasets, so I will locate that citation:

- For the datasets, the citation is:
  > Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. "Character-level convolutional networks for text classification." In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015, pp. 649â€“657.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.
