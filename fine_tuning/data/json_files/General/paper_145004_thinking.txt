To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GridPE: Unifying Positional Encoding in Transformers with a Grid Cell-Inspired Framework" by Boyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using the **ImageNet-1000 dataset** for their image classification task. They describe how they selected ten classes from this dataset and partitioned the images for training and validation. This is a clear indication that the ImageNet-1000 dataset is a key component of their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet-1000 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is the ImageNet-1000 dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
