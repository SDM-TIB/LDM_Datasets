To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Full Resolution Feature Context for Liver Tumor and Vessel Segmentation via Integrate Framework: Application to Liver Tumor and Vessel 3D Reconstruction under Embedded Microprocessor" by Xiangyu Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the segmentation of liver tumors and blood vessels, which suggests that datasets related to medical imaging are likely involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the need for effective segmentation methods and mention the use of CT images for liver tumor and vessel segmentation. This indicates that there may be specific datasets used for training and evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention the use of the **LITS (Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation)** dataset and the **3Dircadb** dataset. The LITS dataset contains 130 cases of tumors, metastases, and cysts, while the 3Dircadb dataset includes 20 patients with varying image resolutions and liver vessel structures.

Additionally, the authors refer to a private dataset they constructed, called the **Liver Tumor Blood Vessel (LTBV)** dataset, which consists of CT images from 18 patients. However, they note that this dataset cannot be made publicly available due to patient privacy concerns.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **LITS Dataset**:
   > "LITS (Liver and Liver Tumor Segmentation) dataset." Available at: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/17094.

2. **3Dircadb Dataset**:
   > "3Dircadb (3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database)." Available at: https://www.ircad.fr/research/3d-ircadb-01/.

3. **LTBV Dataset**:
   > This dataset is not publicly available, but it consists of CT images annotated for liver tumors and blood vessels from 18 patients.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations for the publicly available datasets. This will provide a clear overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
