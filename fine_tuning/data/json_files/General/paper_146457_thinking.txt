To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Anomaly Detection with Noisy Labels by Reinforcement Learning" by Zhu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that extensive experiments were conducted on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Clothing Dataset**: This dataset includes items such as clothing and jewelry from the Amazon website, with nodes representing products and edges indicating co-purchase relationships. The paper states that it contains 9,034 features, 24,919 nodes, 91,680 edges, and 856 anomalies, with an anomaly ratio of 3.44%.

2. **Computer Dataset**: This dataset is a segment of co-purchase graphs related to computer products. It consists of 767 features, 13,381 nodes, 245,778 edges, and 580 anomalies, with an anomaly ratio of 4.33%.

3. **Photo Dataset**: Similar to the Computer dataset, this dataset focuses on photography-related products. It has 745 features, 7,487 nodes, 119,043 edges, and 331 anomalies, with an anomaly ratio of 4.42%.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources for the datasets:

- For the **Clothing Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kaize Ding, Jianling Wang, Jundong Li, Kai Shu, Chenghao Liu, and Huan Liu. *Graph Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning on Attributed Networks*. In Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management, CIKM ’20, pages 295–304, New York, NY, USA, October 2020. Association for Computing Machinery.

- For the **Computer Dataset** and **Photo Dataset**, both datasets are cited from:
  > Oleksandr Shchur, Maximilian Mumme, Aleksandar Bojchevski, and Stephan Günnemann. *Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation*. arXiv, June 2019.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
