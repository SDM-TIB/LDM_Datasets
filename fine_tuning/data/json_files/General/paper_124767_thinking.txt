To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Level Contrastive Learning for Dense Prediction Task" by Qiushan Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, MCL, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention conducting extensive experiments on benchmarks for various dense prediction tasks, including COCO, Cityscapes, and LVIS. This suggests that these datasets are critical to their evaluation.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the methods or results sections. The authors specifically mention using the **COCO dataset** for object detection and instance segmentation tasks, as well as the **Cityscapes dataset** for semantic segmentation tasks. They also refer to the **LVIS dataset** for long-tail object detection and segmentation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, Springer, 2014.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 328–335, 2016.

3. **LVIS Dataset**:
   > Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5356–5364, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation, as this is crucial for proper attribution and reference in any subsequent work or analysis.
