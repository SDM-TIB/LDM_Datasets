To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identification of Internal Faults in Indirect Symmetrical Phase Shift Transformers Using Ensemble Learning" by Pallav Kumar Bera et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that data for 40 different types of internal faults was generated, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Modeling and Fault Data Collection)**, where the authors describe the simulation process. They mention that a dataset of **38,400 cases** was created, with **960 cases for each of the 40 different types of faults**. This section provides crucial information about the dataset's structure and size.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the features extracted and the conditions under which the data was collected. The authors mention that the data includes differential currents from three phases (a, b, and c) and that the output file generated contains **1201 rows and 4 columns** for each case.

To ensure I have the complete context, I will check the **conclusion and references sections** for any citations related to the dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset and Python scripts, which is essential for proper citation.

The dataset is publicly available at the following URL:
> https://github.com/rajeshjnu2006/ISPSTInternalFaults

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Internal Faults Dataset for Indirect Symmetrical Phase Shift Transformers
- **Description**: A dataset containing 38,400 cases of differential currents for 40 different types of internal faults in an ISPST, with 960 cases for each fault type.
- **Citation**: Bera, P. K., Kumar, R., & Isik, C. (2018). Identification of Internal Faults in Indirect Symmetrical Phase Shift Transformers Using Ensemble Learning. In *Proceedings of the 18th IEEE International Symposium on Signal Processing and Information Technology (ISSPIT)*. Available at: https://github.com/rajeshjnu2006/ISPSTInternalFaults

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing.
