To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Knowledge NeRF: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Articulated Objects" by Wenxiao Cai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a new framework and mention "new real-world and synthetic datasets for evaluation of moving articulated objects." This suggests that there are specific datasets that will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that might provide detailed descriptions. In this paper, the **experiments section** (specifically section 5.2) discusses the datasets used. The authors mention utilizing the **Blender dataset**, the **Shiny Blender dataset**, and their proposed **Postbox dataset**, along with real-world datasets named **Telescope** and **Beats**.

I will extract the details for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Blender Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being used in the context of NeRF and is likely a standard dataset in the field. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for it, so I will note that it is commonly known in the literature.

2. **Shiny Blender Dataset**: Similar to the Blender dataset, this is another standard dataset used in NeRF research. Again, the paper does not provide a specific citation, but I will acknowledge its common usage.

3. **Postbox Dataset**: This dataset is proposed by the authors themselves. I will need to note that it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, and since it is not referenced elsewhere, I will cite it as part of this paper.

4. **Telescope Dataset**: This is mentioned as a real-world dataset used in the experiments. The paper does not provide a specific citation, so I will note it as a dataset used in this research.

5. **Beats Dataset**: Like the Telescope dataset, this is another real-world dataset mentioned without a specific citation. I will also note it as part of this research.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets that have them, and for those that do not, I will indicate their status as datasets used in this research without external citations.

The citations I will compile are as follows:

- For the **Postbox Dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Cai, W., Lei, X., He, X., Chen, J.L., & Wang, Y. (2023). Knowledge NeRF: Few-shot Novel View Synthesis for Dynamic Articulated Objects. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

For the **Blender** and **Shiny Blender** datasets, I will note that they are commonly used datasets in the NeRF literature but do not have specific citations in this paper.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the necessary citations and notes about the datasets' origins and usage in the context of this research paper. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the relevant information for future reference or processing.
