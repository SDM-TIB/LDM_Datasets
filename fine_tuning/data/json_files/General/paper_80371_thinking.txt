To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood Estimation for Semi-Supervised Classification" by Marco Loog, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the author discusses the datasets used for the experiments. Here, I will look for any tables or lists that summarize the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

In **Table 1**, the author lists 16 datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, along with their abbreviations. I will note down the full names of these datasets as they are crucial for proper citation.

The datasets mentioned in Table 1 are:
1. **Banknote Authentication** (banknote)
2. **Climate Model Simulation** (climate)
3. **First-Order Theorem Proving** (first-order)
4. **Gas Sensor Array Drift** (gas)
5. **Landsat Satellite** (landsat)
6. **Letter Recognition** (letter)
7. **Low Resolution Spectrometer** (low)
8. **Magic Gamma Telescope** (magic)
9. **Miniboone Particle Identification** (miniboone)
10. **Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits** (optical)
11. **Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits** (pen-based)
12. **QSAR Biodegradation** (qsar)
13. **Shuttle** (shuttle)
14. **Skin Segmentation** (skin)
15. **Spambase** (spambase)
16. **Spectf Heart** (spectf)

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The author provides citations for the datasets used in the experiments, which I will extract and format correctly.

For example, the citation for the **Banknote Authentication dataset** is:
> D. D. Lucas, R. Klein, J. Tannahill, D. Ivanova, S. Brandon, D. Domyancic, and Y. Zhang. *Failure analysis of parameter-induced simulation crashes in climate models*. Geoscientific Model Development Discussions, 6(1):585â€“623, 2013.

I will repeat this process for each dataset listed in Table 1, ensuring that I capture the full citation as it appears in the references.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive list of datasets used in the research, complete with proper citations for each.
