To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Splitting-Based Iterative Algorithm for GPU-Accelerated Statistical Dual-Energy X-Ray CT Reconstruction" by Fangda Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of experimental results on both synthetic and real-world baggage phantoms, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe their experiments on three phantoms: a simulated phantom (sim18), a real-world water bottle phantom (Water), and an actual baggage phantom (Clutter). This indicates that these phantoms are the datasets used for their evaluations.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics, sizes, and how they were used in the experiments. The paper mentions that the simulated phantom contains seven circular regions of different materials, and the real-world phantoms are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, it appears that the paper does not provide formal citations for the phantoms themselves, as they are likely proprietary or created for the study. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are described but do not have formal citations.

The datasets I will summarize are:

1. **Simulated Phantom (sim18)**: Contains seven circular regions of different materials, used for evaluating the proposed method's performance.

2. **Water Phantom**: A real-world phantom used to assess the method's effectiveness in reconstructing images from dual-energy X-ray data.

3. **Baggage Phantom (Clutter)**: Another real-world phantom that includes metallic objects, demonstrating the challenges of statistical reconstruction in practical applications.

Since these datasets do not have formal citations, I will note that they are described in the paper but do not have associated references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset descriptions into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
