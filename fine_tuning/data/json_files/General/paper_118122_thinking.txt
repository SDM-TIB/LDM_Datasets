To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Completely Heterogeneous Federated Learning" by Chang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of federated learning and hint at the use of various datasets to demonstrate their proposed method. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. **MNIST-M**: An extension of the MNIST dataset that includes RGB images, used to evaluate the model's performance in heterogeneous scenarios.
3. **Synthetic Digits**: A dataset created to simulate digit recognition tasks, consisting of synthetic images of digits.
4. **ADULT**: A dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, used for income prediction tasks.
5. **HCC**: A dataset related to hepatocellular carcinoma, used for medical diagnosis.
6. **BCD**: A dataset used for breast cancer diagnosis.
7. **ILPD**: A dataset related to liver disease prediction.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For **MNIST-M**:

- For **BCD**:
  > W H Wolberg and O L Mangasarian. *Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast cytology*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 87, no. 23, pp. 9193–9196, Dec. 1990.

- For **ILPD**:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
