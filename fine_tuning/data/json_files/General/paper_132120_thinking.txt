To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Low-Rank GNN Defense Against Structural Attacks" by Abdullah Alchihabi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research problem.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention using three datasets: **Cora**, **CiteSeer**, and **PolBlogs**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe how they utilized these datasets for their evaluations, including the train/test splits and any preprocessing steps. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were employed in the research.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). *Collective classification in network data*. AI Magazine, 29(3), 93-93.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**:
   > Perozzi, B., Al-Rfou, R., & Skiena, S. (2014). *Deepwalk: Online learning of social representations*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD).

3. **PolBlogs Dataset**:
   > Adamic, L. A., & Glance, N. (2005). *The political blogosphere and the 2004 U.S. election: Divided they blog*. In International Workshop on Link Discovery.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
