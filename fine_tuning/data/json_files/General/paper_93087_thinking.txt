To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sparse Filters In Deep Convolutional Neural Networks With A l1/l2 Pseudo-Norm" by Anthony Berthelier et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experimental results were obtained on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**, which suggests that these are the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section IV, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets. They provide details about the performance of their method on these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is widely known, but I will ensure to provide a proper citation. The CIFAR-10 dataset is also well-documented, so I will retrieve its citation as well.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, commonly used for training various image processing systems.

2. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class, widely used for machine learning and computer vision tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
