To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Consistency and Coherence from Points of Contextual Similarity" by Oleg Vasilyev and John Bohannon, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and might reference specific datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any subsections that discuss the evaluation measures or experiments, as these often include the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention the **SummEval dataset** in section 3, where they describe their evaluation methodology. The SummEval dataset is crucial for their experiments, as it provides human-annotated text-summary pairs for assessing the quality of summarization.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the dataset. The paper states that the SummEval dataset consists of 100 texts, each accompanied by 17 summaries generated by different systems, and that it is annotated by experts for various qualities.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SummEval dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Alexander R. Fabbri, Wojciech Krýscinski, Bryan McCann, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher, and Dragomir Radev. *SummEval: Re-evaluating summarization evaluation*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:391–409, 2021.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction process:

1. **Identify the relevant sections**: I read through the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections to locate mentions of datasets.
2. **Locate specific datasets**: I found that the SummEval dataset is explicitly mentioned as part of the evaluation process.
3. **Gather dataset details**: I noted the characteristics of the SummEval dataset, including its size and purpose.
4. **Retrieve full citation**: I found the complete citation for the SummEval dataset in the references.

Now, I will compile the extracted dataset information into a structured format for further processing.
