To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervised Face Presentation Attack Detection with Dynamic Grayscale Snippets" by Usman Muhammad and Mourad Oussalah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors report results on **four public benchmarks**: Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors provide specific information about each dataset:

1. **Replay-Attack Dataset**: Contains 1,300 videos recorded with a built-in webcam of a Macbook Air laptop, including both live and spoofed videos.

2. **CASIA-FASD Dataset**: Comprises warped photo attacks, video-replay attacks, and cut-photo attacks, totaling 600 video clips.

3. **MSU Mobile Face Spoof Dataset**: Contains 280 videos recorded from 35 candidates using two types of cameras, with each video lasting at least nine seconds.

4. **OULU-NPU Dataset**: Includes 4 protocols and consists of 4,950 real access and attack videos, with various environmental conditions considered.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
