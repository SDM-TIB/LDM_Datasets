To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Practical Approach for Rate-Distortion-Perception Analysis in Learned Image Compression" by Ogun Kirmemis and A. Murat Tekalp, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses related works and may reference datasets used in prior studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** (Section IV), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they trained their network on the **Vimeo-90k dataset** and provide details about the training process.

I will also check the **figures and tables** within the experimental results section, as they may provide additional context or references to datasets. The authors discuss the results obtained from the **Kodak dataset** and the **Set14 dataset** in their examples, which are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Vimeo-90k dataset**: The citation is:
   > T. Xue, B. Chen, J. Wu, D. Wei, and W. T. Freeman. "Video enhancement with task-oriented flow." *International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)*, vol. 127, no. 8, pp. 1106–1125, 2019.

2. **Kodak dataset**: The citation is:
   > R. Zeyde, M. Elad, and M. Protter. "Single image scale-up using sparse-representations." In *Curves and Surfaces*. Springer, 2012, pp. 711–730.

3. **Set14 dataset**: The citation is:
   > R. Zeyde, M. Elad, and M. Protter. "Single image scale-up using sparse-representations." In *Curves and Surfaces*. Springer, 2012, pp. 711–730.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
