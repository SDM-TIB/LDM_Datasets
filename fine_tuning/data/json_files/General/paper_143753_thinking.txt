To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Language Models Trained with Translated Data via Continual Pre-Training and Dictionary Learning Analysis" by Sabri Boughorbel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors translated the **TinyStories** dataset from English to Arabic and synthesized additional stories, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Story Generation SLMs)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **TinyStories dataset**. They mention that it consists of **2.2 million short stories** generated for children, which is a significant dataset for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.

In **section 2.2 (Translated TinyStories)**, the authors describe how they translated the original TinyStories dataset using the **NLLB-3B** machine translation model. This indicates that the translated dataset is also important for their research.

Additionally, in **section 3.1.1 (Synthetic Generation)**, the authors mention synthesizing a small dataset of **20,000 high-quality Arabic stories** using the **Command R+** LLM. This dataset is used for continual pre-training and is another key dataset to extract.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **TinyStories dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li. *TinyStories: How small can language models be and still speak coherent English?* arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.07759, 2023.

2. For the **NLLB-3B model**, the citation is:
   > Marta R Costa-jussÃ  et al. *No language left behind: Scaling human-centered machine translation.* arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.04672, 2022.

3. For the **Command R+ model**, the citation is:
   > Cohere. *Command R+: A highly capable multilingual model.* Cohere API documentation, 2024.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
