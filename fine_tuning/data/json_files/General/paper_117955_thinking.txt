To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating Parameter Efficient Learning for Generation" by Peng Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the evaluation of methods on "new datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (Section 3)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Xsum Dataset**: This dataset is used for summarization tasks and consists of 204,017 training pairs, 11,327 validation pairs, and 11,333 test pairs. The authors also mention a cross-domain version of Xsum, which is split into news articles for training and sports articles for testing, resulting in 149,115 training pairs, 8,263 validation pairs, and 2,823 test pairs.

2. **Wizard of Wazards (WoW) Dataset**: This dataset is used for dialogue generation tasks. The authors describe how they utilize the responses from this dataset for training their models. Additionally, they mention using the **CMU_DoG Dataset** for cross-dataset evaluation in dialogue generation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Xsum Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shashi Narayan, Shay B Cohen, and Mirella Lapata. *Don’t give me the details, just the summary! topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1797–1807, 2018.

- For the **Wizard of Wazards (WoW) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emily Dinan, Stephen Roller, Kurt Shuster, Angela Fan, Michael Auli, and Jason Weston. *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-powered conversational agents*. In International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

- For the **CMU_DoG Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kangyan Zhou, Shrimai Prabhumoye, and Alan W Black. *A dataset for document grounded conversations*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 708–713, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
