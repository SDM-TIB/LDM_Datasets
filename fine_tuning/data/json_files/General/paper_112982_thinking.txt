To extract datasets from the research paper titled "When are Post-hoc Conceptual Explanations Identifiable?" by Tobias Leemann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of a "real-world CUB-200-2011 dataset," which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments conducted.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described in research papers. In Section 4.5, the authors explicitly mention using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset** for their experiments. This section provides context on how the dataset is utilized, including its characteristics and relevance to the study.

I will also check the **related work** and **discussion sections** for any additional datasets that might be referenced or compared against. However, the primary dataset mentioned for the experiments appears to be the CUB-200-2011 dataset.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the CUB-200-2011 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: This dataset consists of high-resolution images of birds, specifically designed for fine-grained classification tasks. It contains a total of 11,788 images across 200 bird species.

Now, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring to include the full citation for the CUB-200-2011 dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent use or analysis.

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the CUB-200-2011 dataset, and its citation is noted for reference.
