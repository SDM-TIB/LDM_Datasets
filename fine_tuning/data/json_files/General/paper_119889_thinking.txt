To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval as Attention: End-to-end Learning of Retrieval and Reading within a Single Transformer" by Zhengbao Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their model on the **Natural Questions dataset (NQ)**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their experiments. The introduction further emphasizes the focus on knowledge-intensive tasks, hinting at the use of various datasets for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **Natural Questions dataset (NQ)** for training their model. They also refer to several other datasets for testing the model's generalization and adaptation capabilities, specifically mentioning **7 datasets from the BEIR benchmark** for zero-shot, supervised, and unsupervised adaptation experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**:
   > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A. P., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Kelcey, M., Chang, M.-W., Dai, A. M., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., & Petrov, S. (2019). Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research. *Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics*, 7, 452–466.

2. **BEIR Benchmark**:
   > Thakur, N., Reimers, N., Rücklé, A., Srivastava, A., & Gurevych, I. (2021). BEIR: A Heterogeneous Benchmark for Zero-shot Evaluation of Information Retrieval Models. In *Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks 1*, NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks 2021, December 2021, virtual.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
