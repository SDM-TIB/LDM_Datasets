To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARAE: Adversarially Robust Training of Autoencoders Improves Novelty Detection" by Mohammadreza Salehi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method is evaluated on "four benchmark datasets and two medical datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **Datasets subsection**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly list the datasets:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset contains 70,000 28 × 28 grayscale handwritten digits from 0 to 9.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset similar to MNIST with 70,000 28 × 28 grayscale images of 10 fashion product categories.
3. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32 × 32 color images of 10 categories.
4. **COIL-100**: A dataset of 7,200 color images of 100 different object classes, with each class containing 72 images of one object captured in different poses.
5. **Head CT - Hemorrhage**: A dataset with 100 normal head CT slices and 100 slices with four different kinds of hemorrhage, with each slice coming from a different person and an image size of 128 × 128.
6. **Brain MRI - Tumor**: A dataset with 253 brain MRI images, where 155 contain brain tumors and the remaining 98 are normal, with an image size of 256 × 256.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. 2010.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **COIL-100**, the citation is:

- For **Head CT - Hemorrhage**, the citation is:
  > Felipe Kitamura. *Head CT - hemorrhage*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/felipekitamura/head-ct-hemorrhage, 2018.

  > N. Chakrabarty. *Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
