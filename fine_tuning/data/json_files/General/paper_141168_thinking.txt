To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Accuracy Enhancement Method for Speech Emotion Recognition from Spectrogram Using Temporal Frequency Correlation and Positional Information Learning Through Knowledge Transfer" by Jeong-Yoon Kim and Seung-Ho Lee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method using three emotion datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **SAVEE Dataset**: This dataset contains 480 acted English utterances recorded by four male actors, categorized into seven emotion categories: anger, fear, disgust, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.

2. **EmoDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 535 German utterances from 10 actors (5 female and 5 male), also categorized into seven emotion categories: anger, anxiety, boredom, disgust, happiness, neutral, and sadness.

3. **CREMA-D Dataset**: This dataset includes 7,442 videos of 91 actors (48 male and 43 female) portraying various emotions through 12 specific sentences corresponding to six emotional categories: anger, fear, disgust, happiness, neutrality, and sadness.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **SAVEE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Haq and P.J.B. Jackson. *Machine Audition: Principles, Algorithms and Systems, chapter Multimodal Emotion Recognition*, pages 398–423. IGI Global, Hershey PA, Aug. 2010.

- For the **EmoDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Felix Burkhardt, Astrid Paeschke, M. Rolfes, Walter F. Sendlmeier, and Benjamin Weiss. *A database of german emotional speech*. In INTERSPEECH 2005 - Eurospeech, 9th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, Lisbon, Portugal, September 4-8, 2005, pages 1517–1520. ISCA, 2005.

- For the **CREMA-D Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
