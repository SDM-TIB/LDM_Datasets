To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Faithful Neural Table-to-Text Generation with Content-Matching Constraints" by Zhenyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "large-scale knowledge base dataset," which suggests that a dataset is indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3), where the authors explicitly state that their model is evaluated on the **Wikiperson dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 250,186 training pairs, 30,487 validation pairs, and 29,982 test pairs. This is a clear indication of the dataset's size and purpose.

I will also check the **related work section** and the **conclusion** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. However, the primary dataset used for evaluation appears to be the Wikiperson dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- For the **Wikiperson dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Q., Pan, X., Huang, L., Zhang, B., Jiang, Z., Ji, H., & Knight, K. (2018). Describing a knowledge base. In International Conference on Natural Language Generation.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **Wikiperson Dataset**: A large-scale dataset containing 250,186 training pairs, 30,487 validation pairs, and 29,982 test pairs for table-to-text generation tasks.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
