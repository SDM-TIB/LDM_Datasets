To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Time Series Model Attribution Visualizations as Explanations" by Udo Schlegel and Daniel A. Keim, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on attribution visualizations for time series, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to specific datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look through the **main body of the paper**, particularly sections that discuss methodologies, experiments, or evaluations. I will pay close attention to any figures, tables, or references that might indicate the datasets used for the experiments or evaluations. 

In the **figures and examples** section, I notice that the authors reference various studies and techniques related to time series attribution. For instance, they mention works by Van der Westhuizen and Lasenby, Assaf and Schumann, and Schlegel et al. These references may imply the use of specific datasets, especially if the studies they cite involve empirical evaluations.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for ensuring that I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset. 

From my review, I identify the following datasets:

1. **Healthcare Data**: Referenced in the work by Van der Westhuizen and Lasenby, which visualizes feature importance for LSTM models. However, the specific dataset name is not provided in the paper, so I will need to cite the original paper for context.
   - Citation: Van der Westhuizen, J., & Lasenby, J. (2017). Techniques for visualizing LSTMs applied to electrocardiograms. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.08153.

2. **Energy Consumption Data**: Used by Assaf and Schumann for their Grad-CAM visualizations. Again, the specific dataset name is not mentioned, so I will cite the original paper.
   - Citation: Assaf, R., & Schumann, A. (2019). Explainable deep neural networks for multivariate time series predictions. In IJCAI (pp. 6488â€“6490).

3. **Uni-variate Time Series Data**: Schlegel et al. evaluate various attribution techniques on this type of data. The specific dataset is not named, but I will reference their work for the context.
   - Citation: Schlegel, U., Arnout, H., El-Assady, M., Oelke, D., & Keim, D. A. (2019). Towards a Rigorous Evaluation of XAI Methods on Time Series. In ICCV Workshop on Interpreting and Explaining Visual Artificial Intelligence Models.

4. **Multi-variate Time Series Data**: Mentioned in the context of Xu et al.'s work, which uses SHAP for visualizations. The dataset specifics are not provided, so I will cite the original paper.
   - Citation: Xu, K., Yuan, J., Wang, Y., Silva, C., & Bertini, E. (2021). MTSeer: Interactive Visual Exploration of Models on Multivariate Time-Series Forecast. Association for Computing Machinery.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name (if available) and the full citation for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
