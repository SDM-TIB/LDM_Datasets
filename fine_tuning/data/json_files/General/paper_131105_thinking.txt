To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Enabled Joint Backscattering and Communication" by Jinqiu Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or "Methodology."** In this paper, I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used for simulations or experiments, as these are crucial for understanding the research's empirical basis.

If the paper includes a **"Results" or "Experiments" section**, I will examine it for any references to datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. The authors may describe how they utilized these datasets in their experiments, which will help me understand their relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset mentioned.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. In Proceedings of the Conference Name, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
