To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FWDA: a Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis with its Application to Electronic Health Records Data Classification" by Haoyi Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale EHR dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **College Health Surveillance Network (CHSN)** dataset, which contains over 1 million patients and 6 million visits from 31 student health centers across the United States. This is a significant dataset for their analysis.

In this section, they also specify that they are particularly interested in mental health disorders, using diagnosis-frequency vectors based on clustered codes. This detail is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CHSN dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is not cited in a traditional manner, as it is a proprietary dataset used by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from the CHSN but may not have a formal citation.

To summarize, the dataset extracted from the paper is:

1. **College Health Surveillance Network (CHSN)**: A large-scale dataset containing over 1 million patients and 6 million visits, focusing on mental health disorders.

Since the dataset does not have a formal citation, I will document it as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: College Health Surveillance Network (CHSN)
- **Description**: Contains over 1 million patients and 6 million visits from 31 student health centers across the United States, focusing on mental health disorders.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that I clearly indicate the dataset's significance and context within the research.
