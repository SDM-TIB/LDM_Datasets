To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Jazz Transformer on the Front Line: Exploring the Shortcomings of AI-composed Music through Quantitative Measures" by Shih-Lun Wu and Yi-Hsuan Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the Weimar Jazz Database (WJazzD) as a key dataset used in their work, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will look closely at **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the dataset's significance in training their model. They explicitly state that the WJazzD dataset is chosen for its unique structure-related events, which indicates its importance in their research.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the WJazzD dataset. They mention that it comprises 456 monophonic Jazz solos, each with specific annotations such as melody and beat tracks. This section gives me the necessary details about the dataset's structure and content.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WJazzD dataset. The authors reference the dataset multiple times, and I need to ensure I capture the correct citation format.

The citation for the WJazzD dataset is:
> Pﬂeiderer, M., Frieler, K., Abeßer, J., Zaddach, W.-G., & Burkhart, B. (2017). Inside the Jazzomat — New Perspectives for Jazz Research. Schott Campus.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examine the methods section for detailed descriptions.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
