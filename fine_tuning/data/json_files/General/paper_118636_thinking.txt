To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SUPRA: Superpixel Guided Loss for Improved Multi-modal Segmentation in Endoscopy" by Rafael Martinez-Garcia-Peña et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their method on the **EndoUDA dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of domain shift in medical imaging, specifically mentioning the use of different modalities for Barrett's Esophagus segmentation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental design** section. In section 4.1, the authors provide details about the **EndoUDA dataset**, stating that it contains images for Barrett's Esophagus from two modalities: White-Light Imaging (WLI) and Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI). They specify that the dataset comprises 799 images for Barrett's Esophagus (284 in NBI and 515 in WLI) and 1042 images for polyps (42 in NBI and 1000 in WLI). However, they clarify that their experiments focus solely on the Barrett's Esophagus split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EndoUDA dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **EndoUDA dataset**:
  > Numan Celik, Sharib Ali, Soumya Gupta, Barbara Braden, and Jens Rittscher. *EndoUDA: A Modality Independent Segmentation Approach for Endoscopy Imaging*. In Marleen de Bruijne, Philippe C. Cattin, Stéphane Cotin, Nicolas Padoy, Stefanie Speidel, Yefeng Zheng, and Caroline Essert, editors, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention – MICCAI 2021, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 303–312, Cham, 2021. Springer International Publishing.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entry for the EndoUDA dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details from the paper regarding the datasets used.
