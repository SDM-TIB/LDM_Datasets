To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Causal Ordering Prior for Unsupervised Representation Learning" by Avinash Kori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on both synthetic and image datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets, including:

1. **Synthetic Datasets (SYN-2, SYN-15, SYN-50)**: These datasets are generated based on a latent causal DAG with varying numbers of nodes and edges. The authors describe the data generation process in detail, indicating that these datasets are synthetic and created for the purpose of their experiments.

2. **MorphoMNIST Datasets**: The authors utilize several variants of the MorphoMNIST dataset, which includes MorphoMNIST-IT, MorphoMNIST-TS, and MorphoMNIST-TSWI. Each variant corresponds to different causal variables affecting the MNIST digits.

3. **Causal3DIdent Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as another dataset used in their experiments, which includes a significant number of training and testing samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. 

For the **MorphoMNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Daniel C Castro, Jeremy Tan, Bernhard Kainz, Ender Konukoglu, and Ben Glocker. *Morpho-mnist: Quantitative assessment and diagnostics for representation learning*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 20(178):1–29, 2019.

For the **Causal3DIdent dataset**, the citation is:
> Julius Von Kügelgen, Yash Sharma, Luigi Gresele, Wieland Brendel, Bernhard Schölkopf, Michel Besserve, and Francesco Locatello. *Self-supervised learning with data augmentations provably isolates content from style*. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:16451–16467, 2021.

The synthetic datasets (SYN-2, SYN-15, SYN-50) are generated by the authors and do not have a formal citation, but I will note that they are based on a latent causal DAG as described in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
