To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AERO: Audio Super Resolution in the Spectral Domain" by Moshe Mandel, Or Tal, and Yossi Adi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the AERO model's performance on speech and music signals, which suggests that datasets related to these domains might be used.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **VCTK Dataset**: This dataset contains around 44 hours of speech from 110 speakers, sampled at 48 kHz. The authors specify that they used recordings from mic1 and omitted speakers p280 and p315 for their experiments.

2. **MusDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 songs (10 hours) of musical mixtures, along with isolated stems, sampled at 44.1 kHz. The authors indicate that they used only the mixture tracks for testing their model.

After identifying the datasets, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **VCTK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Junichi Yamagishi et al., “CSTR VCTK Corpus: English Multi-Speaker Corpus for CSTR Voice Cloning Toolkit,” 2019.

- For the **MusDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zafar Rafii et al., “MusDB18-HQ - An Uncompressed Version of MusDB18,” 2019.

Now that I have the names and citations for the datasets, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper while adhering to the importance of providing complete citations.
