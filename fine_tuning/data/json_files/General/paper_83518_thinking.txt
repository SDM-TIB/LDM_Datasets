To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spherical U-Net on Cortical Surfaces: Methods and Applications" by Fenqiang Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and while it may not list datasets, it sets the context for the research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the significance of their work and may reference datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that utilized specific datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to the subsections that describe the datasets used for validation. Here, the authors mention two specific tasks: cortical surface parcellation and cortical attribute map development prediction. I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used for these tasks.

1. **Infant Brain MRI Dataset**: The authors mention using an infant brain MRI dataset with 90 term-born neonates. They describe the processing pipeline and the attributes coded for each vertex on the cortical surface. This dataset is crucial for their cortical surface parcellation task.

2. **Longitudinal Infant Brain MRI Data**: For the cortical attribute map development prediction task, the authors refer to a dataset comprising 370 infants with longitudinal MRI data. This dataset is essential for predicting cortical thickness maps at different ages.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites several works that may include the datasets or methodologies relevant to the datasets mentioned.

- For the **Infant Brain MRI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, G., Wang, L., Shi, F., Gilmore, J.H., Lin, W., Shen, D. (2015). *Construction of 4D high-definition cortical surface atlases of infants: Methods and applications*. Medical Image Analysis, 25(1), 22-36.

- For the **Longitudinal Infant Brain MRI Data**, the citation is:
  > Meng, Y., Li, G., Rekik, I., Zhang, H., Gao, Y., Lin, W., Shen, D. (2017). *Can we predict subject-specific dynamic cortical thickness maps during infancy from birth?* Human Brain Mapping, 38(6), 2865-2874.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
