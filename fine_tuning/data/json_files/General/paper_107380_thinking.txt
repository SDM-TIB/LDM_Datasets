To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Transmit Waveform and Passive Beamforming Design for RIS-Aided DFRC Systems" by Rang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract typically provides a concise overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. In this case, the abstract discusses the use of reconfugurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems, which may imply the use of specific datasets for simulations or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any references to datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, and it may mention specific datasets that are critical for the experiments or simulations conducted.

I will then examine the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study.

Following that, I will look into the **results and discussion sections**. Here, the authors may refer to the datasets again when discussing their findings, which can help confirm the datasets identified earlier.

After gathering information about the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets related to radar and communication systems, as the title suggests a focus on these areas. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and the corresponding citations.

Once I have compiled all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details, along with the full citation for each dataset as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
