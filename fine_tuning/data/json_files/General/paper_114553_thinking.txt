To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Semantic Alignment System for Multilingual Query-Product Retrieval" by Qi Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a "real-world large-scale multilingual shopping queries data set," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's purpose in the context of the Amazon ESCI Challenge.

Next, I will focus on **section 1.1 (Dataset Description)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. They mention the "Shopping Queries Dataset," which includes query-product pairs in English, Japanese, and Spanish. This section outlines the dataset's structure, including the number of products and query-product pairs, as well as the relevance categories (Exact, Substitute, Complement, and Irrelevant).

In this section, I will note the key details:
- The dataset contains approximately **1.2 million products** and **2 million query-product pairs**.
- It provides a list of up to 40 potentially relevant product results for each query, along with relevance judgments and locale labels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the "Shopping Queries Dataset." The relevant citation is:
> Chandan K Reddy, Lluís Màrquez, Fran Valero, Nikhil Rao, Hugo Zaragoza, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Arnab Biswas, Anlu Xing, and Karthik Subbian. *Shopping Queries Dataset: A Large-Scale ESCI Benchmark for Improving Product Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.06588, 2022.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Dataset Name**: Shopping Queries Dataset
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset containing approximately 1.2 million products and 2 million query-product pairs in English, Japanese, and Spanish, used for ranking and relevance classification in product search.
   - **Full Citation**: Chandan K Reddy, Lluís Màrquez, Fran Valero, Nikhil Rao, Hugo Zaragoza, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay, Arnab Biswas, Anlu Xing, and Karthik Subbian. *Shopping Queries Dataset: A Large-Scale ESCI Benchmark for Improving Product Search*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.06588, 2022.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and their citations from the research paper.
