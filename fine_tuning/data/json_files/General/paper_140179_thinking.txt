To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Supervision in Time for Satellite Images (S3-TSS)" by Akansh Maurya et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors perform experiments on various downstream datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets used in their research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of labeled data in remote sensing and the potential of self-supervised learning. They reference the Seasonal Contrast (SeCo) dataset, which is crucial for their pre-training task. This suggests that the SeCo dataset is one of the primary datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.3 (Datasets for Downstream Tasks of Interest)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their downstream tasks. They mention four datasets:

1. **EuroSAT Dataset**: This dataset consists of 27,000 labeled images across ten classes related to land use and land cover.

2. **Aerial Image Dataset (AID)**: A large-scale dataset containing 10,000 images categorized into 30 different aerial scene types.

3. **UCMerced Land Use Dataset**: This dataset includes 2,100 images across 21 classes, with each image measuring 256x256 pixels.

4. **WHU-RS19 Dataset**: A high-resolution dataset with 19 classes of scenes, containing approximately 50 samples per class.

Additionally, I will note that the authors used the **SeCo dataset** for pre-training, which consists of 100,000 images with seasonal variants.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SeCo dataset**, the citation is:

With all this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
