To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generalization Error Bounds of Gradient Descent for Learning Over-parameterized Deep ReLU Networks" by Yuan Cao and Quanquan Gu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (if available) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will focus on that to gather specific details about each dataset. I will note down the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics provided by the authors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "CIFAR-10" dataset, I would look for the citation in the references section, which might look something like this:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A Benchmark in Image Classification*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, making sure to include all relevant information for each dataset extracted from the paper.
