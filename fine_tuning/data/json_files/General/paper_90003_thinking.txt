To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Discovering Contemporaneous and Lagged Causal Relations in Autocorrelated Nonlinear Time Series Datasets" by Jakob Runge, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a novel method for causal discovery but does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the author discusses various frameworks and methods related to causal discovery but again does not specify any datasets.

I will then look into the **numerical experiments** section, which is typically where datasets are described. In this section, the author mentions several model setups and challenges but does not provide specific dataset names. However, it is crucial to note that the experiments are based on synthetic data generated under specific conditions, which may not correspond to publicly available datasets.

Next, I will check the **references** section for any citations that might refer to datasets used in the experiments. The references include various foundational papers and methods but do not point to specific datasets.

Since the paper primarily discusses a new method and its application to synthetic data rather than existing datasets, I will conclude that there are no publicly available datasets cited in this paper. 

If I were to summarize the findings, I would note that while the paper introduces a novel method and discusses its application, it does not provide specific datasets for further use or citation.

In summary, I will not be able to extract any datasets from this paper as it does not reference any specific datasets, focusing instead on the methodology and its implications for causal discovery in time series data.
