To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate Anchor Free Tracking" by Shengyun Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method using **five commonly used benchmarks**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They list the following datasets:

1. **OTB2015**: This dataset is described as a benchmark with 100 fully annotated sequences for performance evaluation. It is an extension of OTB2013, which contains 50 representative video sequences.

2. **VOT2015**: This dataset consists of 60 sequences and is constructed using a novel video clustering approach based on visual properties. It is fully annotated, with all sequences labeled per-frame.

3. **VOT2016**: Similar to VOT2015, this dataset contains the same video sequences but with re-annotated groundtruth bounding boxes.

4. **VOT2018**: This dataset also consists of 60 video sequences and is evaluated in terms of accuracy and robustness.

5. **TrackingNet**: This is a large-scale dataset and benchmark for object tracking in the wild, providing over 30K videos with more than 14 million dense bounding box annotations.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
