To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TokenMix: Rethinking Image Mixing for Data Augmentation in Vision Transformers" by Jihao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **ImageNet-1K** and **ADE20K** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset contains 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation. It is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation and contains a total of 25,000 images, with 20,000 for training, 2,000 for validation, and 3,000 for testing.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248–255.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Zhao, H., Puig, X., Fidler, S., Barriuso, A., Torralba, A. (2017). *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 633–641.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
