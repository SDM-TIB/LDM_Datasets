To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Transfer Learning via Winning Lottery Tickets" by Rahul S. Mehta, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their findings using **CIFAR-10**, **SmallNORB**, and **FashionMNIST** datasets, which suggests that these are key datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the author describes the methodology and results. Here, the paper explicitly states that they use **CIFAR-10** as the source dataset and **SmallNORB** and **FashionMNIST** as target datasets for their transfer learning tasks. This confirms the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **acknowledgements** sections to ensure there are no additional datasets referenced or discussed. However, it seems that the primary datasets have already been identified in the earlier sections.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

2. **SmallNORB**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Fu Jie Huang, Leon Bottou, et al. Learning methods for generic object recognition with invariance to pose and lighting. Citeseer.

3. **FashionMNIST**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. Fashion-mnist: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. CoRR, abs/1708.07747, 2017. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **SmallNORB**: A dataset designed for 3D object recognition, containing 24,300 images of 5,000 objects.
- **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items, with 10 categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
