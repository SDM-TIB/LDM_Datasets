To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edinburgh Clinical NLP at SemEval-2024 Task 2" by Aryo Pradipta Gema et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates various Large Language Models (LLMs) on the NLI4CT task, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention the NLI4CT task and its reliance on a collection of Clinical Trial Reports (CTRs) and expert-annotated hypotheses. This indicates that the NLI4CT dataset is central to their research.

In the **background section**, the authors elaborate on the dataset's structure, mentioning that it consists of CTRs and hypotheses. They also provide statistics for the dataset splits in **Table 1**, which details the number of samples, types, and labels. This table is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to any specific datasets used in their experiments. They mention the NLI4CT task and its associated datasets, confirming that the NLI4CT dataset is indeed the primary dataset utilized in their evaluations.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the NLI4CT dataset. The authors reference the original work that introduced the NLI4CT task, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the NLI4CT dataset is:
> Maël Jullien, Marco Valentino, and André Freitas. *SemEval-2024 task 2: Safe biomedical natural language inference for clinical trials*. In Proceedings of the 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2024). Association for Computational Linguistics, 2024.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the dataset details, ensuring to include the full citation for the NLI4CT dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding, ready for further processing or review.
