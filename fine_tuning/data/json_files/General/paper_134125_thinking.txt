To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Task and Weight Prioritization Curriculum Learning for Multimodal Imagery" by Huseyin Fuat Alsan and Taner Arsan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **FloodNet dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **FloodNet dataset** in the **methodology section**. The authors describe it as containing high-resolution aerial imagery for post-disaster damage assessment, specifically from Hurricane Harvey. They mention that the dataset includes annotations for both semantic segmentation and visual question answering (VQA) tasks.

In the **dataset description**, the authors provide details about the types of annotations available in the FloodNet dataset, including segmentation masks for various classes (e.g., building-flooded, road-non-flooded) and question-answer pairs for VQA. This confirms the dataset's relevance and utility for their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citation for the FloodNet dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> Rahnemoonfar, M., Chowdhury, T., Sarkar, A., Varshney, D., Yari, M., & Murphy, R. R. (2021). FloodNet: A high resolution aerial imagery dataset for post flood scene understanding. *IEEE Access*, 9, 89644â€“89654. doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3090981.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **FloodNet Dataset**: This dataset is used for post-disaster analytics, specifically for semantic segmentation and visual question answering tasks. It contains high-resolution aerial images and is annotated for various classes relevant to disaster assessment.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
