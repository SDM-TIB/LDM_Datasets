To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable and Flexible Target-Conditioned Neural Planners For Autonomous Vehicles" by Haolan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted a systematic evaluation on the **Lyft Open Dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Methods** section, particularly where they discuss the data used for training and evaluation. In this case, the authors explicitly mention using the **Lyft dataset** for training their model. They describe it as a large-scale real-world driving dataset collected over multiple cities, consisting of around 170,000 scenarios, each about 25 seconds long.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **Lyft dataset**. The citation provided in the references is:

> J. L. Houston, G. C. A. Zuidhof, L. Bergamini, Y. Ye, A. Jain, S. Omari, V. I. Iglovikov, and P. Ondruska. *One thousand and one hours: Self-driving motion prediction dataset*. In Conference on Robot Learning, 2020.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **Lyft dataset**, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the **Lyft dataset** as it is essential for proper attribution and reference.

In summary, the steps I followed include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial dataset mentions.
2. Examining the methods section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Consulting the references for full citations of the datasets mentioned.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the **Lyft dataset**.
