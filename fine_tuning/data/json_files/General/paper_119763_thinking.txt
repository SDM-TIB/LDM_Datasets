To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Low-Rank Tensor Function Representation for Multi-Dimensional Data Recovery" by Yisi Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and the context in which they were used.

In this paper, the authors discuss various applications of their method, including multi-dimensional image inpainting, multispectral image denoising, hyperparameter optimization, and point cloud upsampling. I will look for datasets associated with these applications.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

From my reading, I will identify the following datasets:

1. **CAVE Dataset**: Used for multispectral image denoising. The citation is:
   > Yasuma, F., Mitsunaga, T., Iso, D., & Nayar, S. K. (2010). Generalized assorted pixel camera: Postcapture control of resolution, dynamic range, and spectrum. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 19(9), 2241-2253.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: Used for point cloud upsampling. The citation is:
   > Chang, A. X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Song, S., Su, H., Xiao, J., Yi, L., & Yu, F. (2015). ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012*.

3. **Various Color Images**: Used for multi-dimensional image inpainting. The specific datasets are not named, but they include standard datasets used in image processing research.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or verification.
