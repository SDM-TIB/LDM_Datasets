To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MEMoE: Enhancing Model Editing with Mixture of Experts Adaptors" by Renzhi Wang and Piji Li, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using two prominent model editing datasets, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, they state that they used two datasets: **ZsRE** and **COUNTERFACT**. I will take note of the descriptions provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and purposes.

1. **ZsRE Dataset**: This is described as a context-free Question Answering (QA) dataset built upon zero-shot relation extraction. The authors mention that it uses question rephrasing generated by back-translation as the equivalence neighborhood.

2. **COUNTERFACT Dataset**: This dataset is noted for being more challenging, focusing on counterfactual information. It constructs out-of-scope instances by substituting the primary entity with a comparable descriptor while maintaining the same predicate.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

- For **ZsRE**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017), pages 333â€“342. Association for Computational Linguistics. doi: 10.18653/V1/K17-1034. URL: https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/K17-1034.

- For **COUNTERFACT**, the citation is:
  > Meng, K., Bau, D., Andonian, A., & Belinkov, Y. (2023). Mass-editing memory in a transformer. In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023). OpenReview.net. URL: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=MkbcAHIYgyS.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
