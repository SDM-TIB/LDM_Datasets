To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Constrained Optimization via Exact Augmented Lagrangian and Randomized Iterative Sketching" by Ilgee Hong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention benchmarking their method on the **CUTEst test set**, **constrained logistic regression with data from LIBSVM**, and a **PDE-constrained problem**. These references indicate that datasets are involved, but I need to find their specific names and details.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used. They mention using the **LIBSVM datasets** for constrained logistic regression, specifying several datasets with their feature dimensions and number of data points. The datasets listed include:

1. **W8A**: Feature dimension = 300, Number of data points = 49,749.
2. **A9A**: Feature dimension = 123, Number of data points = 32,561.
3. **SPLICE**: Feature dimension = 60, Number of data points = 1,000.
4. **SONAR**: Feature dimension = 60, Number of data points = 208.
5. **PHISHING**: Feature dimension = 68, Number of data points = 11,055.
6. **MUSHROOMS**: Feature dimension = 112, Number of data points = 8,124.
7. **IONOSPHERE**: Feature dimension = 34, Number of data points = 351.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following sources:

- For **LIBSVM**, the citation is:
  > Chang, C.-C., & Lin, C.-J. (2011). LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines. *ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology*, 2(3), 1–27. doi:10.1145/1961189.1961199.

- For **CUTEst**, the citation is:
  > Gould, N. I. M., Orban, D., & Toint, P. L. (2014). CUTEst: A constrained and unconstrained testing environment with safe threads for mathematical optimization. *Computational Optimization and Applications*, 60(3), 545–557. doi:10.1007/s10589-014-9687-3.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. Each dataset will include its name, description, and full citation.
