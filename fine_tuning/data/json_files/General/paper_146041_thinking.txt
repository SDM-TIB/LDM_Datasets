To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pseudo-label Based Domain Adaptation for Zero-Shot Text Steganalysis" by Yufei Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on three widely used datasets: **Twitter (T)**, **Movie (M)**, and **News (N)**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Twitter (T)**: This dataset consists of text content from tweets, which serves as a source of cover text and stego text for the experiments.

2. **Movie (M)**: This dataset includes comments and reviews related to movies, also used for generating cover and stego texts.

3. **News (N)**: This dataset comprises news articles, providing another domain for testing the proposed method.

In this section, the authors also specify that each dataset contains both cover text (original text) and stego text (hidden text) generated using a specific method. They mention that the training dataset for each domain comprises 10,000 cover texts and 10,000 stego texts, with validation and test datasets consisting of 1,000 cover texts and 1,000 stego texts.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang. “Twitter sentiment classification using distant supervision”. In: CS224N project report, Stanford 1.12 (2009), p. 2009.

- For the **Movie dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andrew Maas et al. “Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis”. In: Proceedings of the 49th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics: Human language technologies. 2011, pp. 142–150.

- For the **News dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Thompson. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news/data. 2017.

With this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
