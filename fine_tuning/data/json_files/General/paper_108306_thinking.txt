To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scale-free Unconstrained Online Learning for Curved Losses" by Jack J. Mayo, HÃ©di Hadiji, and Tim van Erven, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments, including any specific characteristics or details about the datasets.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets used, as these often contain concise information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant metrics.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For this paper, I will look for datasets that might be mentioned in the context of online learning, convex optimization, or any specific algorithms discussed. I will ensure to note down the following for each dataset:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. The full citation for the dataset as provided in the references section of the paper.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are well-documented and easily accessible for future reference or use in related research.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I extract all relevant datasets from the paper accurately and comprehensively.
