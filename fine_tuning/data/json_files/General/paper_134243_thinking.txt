To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What a Whole Slide Image Can Tell? Subtype-guided Masked Transformer for Pathological Image Captioning" by Wenkang Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **PatchGastricADC22 dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **PatchGastricADC22 dataset** in the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset as containing over 262,777 patches extracted from 991 H&E stained slides, with each patch corresponding to a caption from diagnostic reports. This section provides essential information about the dataset's size, content, and structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **PatchGastricADC22 dataset**. The authors reference it as follows:
> Tsuneki, M., & Kanavati, F. (2022). Inference of captions from histopathological patches. In *International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning* (PMLR, pp. 1235â€“1250).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
