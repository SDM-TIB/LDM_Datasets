To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformer Mechanisms Mimic Frontostriatal Gating Operations When Trained on Human Working Memory Tasks" by Aaron Traylor et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context of the research and may reference datasets that are central to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe a modified version of the "reference-back 2" task, which is a human paradigm designed to study working memory. I will pay close attention to any mention of datasets used to create training, validation, or test sequences for this task.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention generating 100,000 training sequences, 1,000 development sequences, and 1,000 held-out test sequences. However, they do not explicitly name a publicly available dataset. Instead, they describe the structure of the data they created for their experiments. This indicates that the dataset is likely original and specific to their study.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the dataset is a custom dataset created for the purpose of this research. I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Textual Reference-Back Task Dataset**: This dataset consists of sequences designed to evaluate selective working memory gating. It includes 100,000 training sequences, 1,000 development sequences, and 1,000 held-out test sequences. Each sequence contains tuples with register addresses, symbols, same/different labels, and update instructions.

Finally, I will compile the information regarding the dataset into a structured format, ensuring to include the citation for the paper itself, as it serves as the source for the dataset description.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Traylor, A., Merullo, J., Frank, M. J., & Pavlick, E. (2023). Transformer Mechanisms Mimic Frontostriatal Gating Operations When Trained on Human Working Memory Tasks. *Proceedings of the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)*.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on this information, ensuring clarity and completeness in the description.
