To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Content Enhanced BERT-based Text-to-SQL Generation" by Tong Guo and Huilin Gao, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors tested their model on the **WikiSQL dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors describe the WikiSQL dataset as a large semantic parsing dataset containing 80,654 natural language and corresponding SQL pairs. This provides a clear description of the dataset's purpose and size.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their methods against other approaches on the WikiSQL dataset, confirming its use in their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WikiSQL dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Zhong, V., Xiong, C., & Socher, R. (2017). Seq2sql: Generating structured queries from natural language using reinforcement learning. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.00103*.

Since the WikiSQL dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry includes the full citation, as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work. After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for output.
