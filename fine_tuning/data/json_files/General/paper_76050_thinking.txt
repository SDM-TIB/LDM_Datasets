To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Embarrassingly Parallel Inference for Gaussian Processes" by Michael Minyi Zhang and Sinead A. Williamson, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, it does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically described in detail. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or experimental setups. In this paper, Section 4 discusses experimental evaluations, and I will pay particular attention to any subsections that detail the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

Upon reviewing Section 4, I find that the authors mention using a dataset consisting of **209,631 mid-tropospheric CO2 measurements** from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). This dataset is crucial for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AIRS dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset, but it mentions that the data is available in the R package FRK. Therefore, I will note that the dataset can be accessed through this package.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their method on synthetic datasets, but they do not provide specific names or citations for these datasets. Since these synthetic datasets are generated for the purpose of the experiments, they do not have formal citations.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the AIRS dataset as follows:

1. **AIRS Dataset**: A dataset consisting of mid-tropospheric CO2 measurements over space and time, used for evaluating the proposed method.
   - Citation: Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data available in the R package FRK.

Since the synthetic datasets do not have formal citations, I will only include the AIRS dataset in my final output.

After gathering all relevant information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
