To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Clustered Gaussian Graphical Model via Symmetric Convex Clustering" by Tianyi Yao and Genevera I. Allen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions "experimental results on both synthetic data and real-world neuroscientific data," indicating that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **subsection 3.1 (Synthetic Data)**, the authors describe how they generated synthetic datasets for their experiments. They specify two scenarios for data generation, detailing the number of neurons, clusters, and the method of generating the data matrix. However, these datasets are synthetic and do not have formal citations.

In **subsection 3.2 (Case Study: Calcium Imaging Data)**, the authors mention a publicly available calcium imaging dataset. They reference two sources for this dataset, which are crucial for citation purposes. I will extract the relevant details:

1. **Synthetic Data**: While the authors describe the generation of synthetic datasets, they do not provide formal citations since these are not publicly available datasets.

2. **Calcium Imaging Data**: The authors refer to two sources:
   - For the calcium imaging data, the citation is:
     > Carsen Stringer, Marius Pachitariu, Nicholas Steinmetz, Charu Bai Reddy, Matteo Carandini, and Kenneth D. Harris. *Spontaneous behaviors drive multidimensional, brain-wide population activity*. bioRxiv, 2018, DOI: 10.1101/306019.
   - Additionally, they reference:
     > Carsen Stringer, Marius Pachitariu, Charu Reddy, Matteo Carandini, and Kenneth D. Harris. *Recordings of ten thousand neurons in visual cortex during spontaneous behaviors*. 5 2018, DOI: https://doi.org/10.25378/janelia.6163622.v6.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to document them properly, emphasizing the importance of full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
