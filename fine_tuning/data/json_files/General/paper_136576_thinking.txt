To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adv-Diffusion: Imperceptible Adversarial Face Identity Attack via Latent Diffusion Model" by Decheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference "extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the public FFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets," indicating that these datasets are used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**: This dataset is described as a widely used high-quality face dataset containing almost 70,000 high-quality face images with a resolution of 1024 × 1024.

2. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: This dataset is constructed based on the CelebA dataset and contains almost 30,000 face images with a resolution of 512 × 512.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **FFHQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T.; Laine, S.; and Aila, T. (2019). *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 4401–4410.

- For the **CelebA-HQ Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Karras, T.; Aila, T.; Laine, S.; and Lehtinen, J. (2018). *Progressive growing of gans for improved quality, stability, and variation*. International Conference on Learning Representations, 1–12.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
