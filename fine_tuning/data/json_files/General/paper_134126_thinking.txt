To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WEB3 MEETS AI MARKETPLACE: EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES, ANALYZING CHALLENGES, AND SUGGESTING SOLUTIONS" by Peihao Li, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing opportunities and challenges** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific references to datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **sections that discuss the integration of Web3 and AI**, particularly looking for any empirical studies or experiments that might involve datasets. I will pay attention to any tables, figures, or references that might indicate the presence of datasets.

As I read through the paper, I will take note of any datasets that are explicitly mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the context in which they are used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Filecoin" or "IPFS," I will look for the original papers or documentation that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will format the information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
