To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Integrating Commercial and Social Determinants of Health: A Unified Ontology for Non-Clinical Determinants of Health" by Navya Martin Kollapally et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research objectives, but I will need to delve deeper into the methods and results to find specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) and Commercial Determinants of Health (CDoH), but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will move on to the **methods section** where they describe their approach to developing the CDoH ontology.

In the **methods section**, they mention using **PubMed Central (PMC)** as a source for identifying relevant research articles. They conducted a scoping search in PMC, which returned a total of **23,342 full-text articles**. However, this is not a dataset in the traditional sense but rather a collection of articles used for concept extraction.

Next, I will check the **results section** to see if any specific datasets are mentioned. The authors describe the development of the N-CODH ontology and the integration of various ontologies, but again, they do not specify any datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that while the authors utilized a large number of articles from PMC for their research, they did not explicitly mention any standalone datasets that would require citation. Instead, the focus was on the development of an ontology based on the literature reviewed.

Since no specific datasets were identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as there are none to report. However, I will note that the authors referenced **PubMed Central (PMC)** as a significant resource for their research.

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings and document that while the paper discusses the use of literature from PMC, it does not provide specific datasets with citations. This will be important for any future reference or analysis related to the paper.
