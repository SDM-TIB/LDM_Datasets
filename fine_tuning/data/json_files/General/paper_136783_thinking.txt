To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Balancing the Style-Content Trade-Off in Sentiment Transfer Using Polarity-Aware Denoising" by Sourabrata Mukherjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions a new sentiment transfer dataset derived from the Amazon Review Dataset, which indicates that this dataset is significant for the research. The introduction further elaborates on the dataset's diversity compared to others like Yelp and IMDb.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, specifically **subsection 5.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **WMT14 English-German Dataset**: This dataset is used for the back-translation process and model pretraining. The authors note that it contains 1 million sentences.

2. **Amazon Review Dataset**: This dataset is the primary focus for their sentiment transfer experiments. The authors explain that they selected it for its topical diversity, which includes categories like books, electronics, movies, and fashion. They also mention that they filtered the reviews into sentences and used a pre-trained sentiment classifier to select high-polarity sentences.

3. **IMDb Dataset**: This dataset is used for comparison with previous work. The authors state that it is a well-known benchmark for sentiment analysis.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **WMT14 English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Neidert, J., Schuster, S., Green, S., Heafield, K., Manning, C.D. (2014). Stanford University’s Submissions to the WMT 2014 Translation Task. In Proceedings of the WMT, pp. 150–156.

- For the **Amazon Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ni, J., Li, J., McAuley, J.J. (2019). Justifying Recommendations using Distantly-Labeled Reviews and Fine-Grained Aspects. In Proceedings of the EMNLP-IJCNLP, pp. 188–197.

- For the **IMDb Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dai, N., Liang, J., Qiu, X., Huang, X. (2019). Style transformer: Unpaired text style transfer without disentangled latent representation. In Proceedings of the ACL, pp. 5997–6007.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
