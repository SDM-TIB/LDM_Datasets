To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solution for the EPO CodeFest on Green Plastics: Hierarchical multi-label classification of patents relating to green plastics using deep learning" by Tingting Qiao and Gonzalo Moro PÃ©rez, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a labeled training dataset for classifying patents related to green plastics, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the lack of existing labeled data for the classification of patents in this emerging field, which implies that they have developed a dataset for their experiments.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 5 (Training dataset)**, the authors describe the dataset they used. They mention using the **EP full text data**, which contains all publications of EP patent applications and patent specifications from 1978 until January 2022. This dataset comprises over 6 million publications, making it a significant resource for their classification task.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the EP full text data. The citation is as follows:
> European Patent Office. *EP full-text data for text analytics*.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **EP full text data**: This dataset includes all publications of EP patent applications and patent specifications from 1978 until January 2022, totaling over 6 million publications. It is used to create a labeled training dataset for the classification of patents related to green plastics.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for future reference.
