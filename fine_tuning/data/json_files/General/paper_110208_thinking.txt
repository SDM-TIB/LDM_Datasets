To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Generalizable Semantic Product Search by Text Similarity" by Zheng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "publicly available manual annotated query-product pair data," which indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to look into further.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the importance of generalization in semantic search and mention the use of clickstream data. This suggests that there may be datasets related to clickstream data or query-product pairs.

In the **methodology section**, particularly in **section 3.5 (Fine-tuning for Semantic Search)**, the authors describe the training dataset, which consists of 31 million (query, product) pairs collected from a search engine. They also mention a development dataset containing 100,000 pairs sampled from 2021. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the authors refer to the **WANDS dataset** in their evaluation, which is a human-annotated dataset for assessing product search relevance. This dataset contains (query, product) pairs with relevance labels, and it is crucial to include this in my extraction.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **WANDS dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yan Chen, Shujian Liu, Zheng Liu, Weiyi Sun, Linas Baltrunas, and Benjamin Schroeder. *Wands: Dataset for product search relevance assessment*. In Proceedings of the 44th European Conference on Information Retrieval, 2022.

2. For the **clickstream data**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, it is mentioned as a publicly available dataset. I will note this as a general dataset used in their experiments.

3. The training dataset is derived from the authors' internal data and does not have a formal citation, but I will document it as a dataset used in their study.

After compiling this information, I will create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
