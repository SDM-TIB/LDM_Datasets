To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GraphEval2000: Benchmarking and Improving Large Language Models on Graph Datasets" by Qiming Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets discussed. The abstract mentions the introduction of **GraphEval2000**, which is described as a comprehensive graph dataset comprising 40 graph data structure problems along with 2000 test cases. This indicates that there is a primary dataset to focus on.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions. In this paper, the dataset is elaborated in **section 3 (Dataset Construction)**. Here, the authors describe the dataset's structure, including the number of problems, types of graphs, and how the test cases were generated.

The key dataset identified is:

1. **GraphEval2000**: This dataset is specifically designed to evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It includes 40 data structure problems and 2000 test cases, categorized into four main graph categories: Sparse, Planar, Regular, and Complete graphs, with further sub-categories.

In the **References section**, I will look for any citations related to the dataset. However, since GraphEval2000 is a new dataset introduced in this paper, it may not have an external citation yet. The authors do provide a link to access the dataset, which is important for users who want to utilize it.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
> Wu, Q., Chen, Z., Corcoran, W., Sra, M., & Singh, A. K. (2024). GraphEval2000: Benchmarking and Improving Large Language Models on Graph Datasets. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.07103*.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for GraphEval2000, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a structured entry ready for review or further processing, focusing on the dataset's details and its citation.
