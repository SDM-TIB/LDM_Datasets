To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FoSp: Focus and Separation Network for Early Smoke Segmentation" by Lujian Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new dataset called **SmokeSeg**, which is a strong indicator that I should look for details about this dataset.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**. Here, the authors discuss the challenges of early smoke segmentation and highlight the need for a dataset tailored to this task. They mention that **SmokeSeg** contains 6,144 real images of smoke, which is a significant detail that I need to note.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **SmokeSeg dataset**. They emphasize that it includes pixel-wise annotations and is the largest dataset available for this purpose, containing more images than the existing datasets like **SMOKE5K** and **SYN70K**. This section confirms the importance of the **SmokeSeg dataset** for their experiments.

I will also look for any references to other datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention **SYN70K** and **SMOKE5K** as datasets they compare their results against. I will need to gather details about these datasets as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **SmokeSeg**: The paper does not provide a separate citation for this dataset since it is introduced by the authors themselves. However, I will note the details provided in the paper:
   - SmokeSeg: Contains 6,144 real images with pixel-wise annotations.

2. **SYN70K**: The citation is:
   > Siyuan Yan, Jing Zhang, and Nick Barnes. *Transmission-guided bayesian generative model for smoke segmentation*. 2022.

3. **SMOKE5K**: The citation is:
   > Anshuman Dewangan, Yash Pande, Hans-Werner Braun, Frank Vernon, Ismael Perez, Ilkay Altintas, Garrison W Cottrell, and Mai H Nguyen. *Figlib & smokeynet: Dataset and deep learning model for real-time wildland fire smoke detection*. Remote Sensing, 14(4):1007, 2022.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **SmokeSeg**: A new dataset introduced in the paper, containing 6,144 real images with pixel-wise annotations.
- **SYN70K**: A synthetic dataset comprising 70,000 images.
- **SMOKE5K**: A dataset containing 1,360 real images and 4,000 synthetic images.

Finally, I will compile these dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
