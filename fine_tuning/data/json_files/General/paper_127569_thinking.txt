To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffusionNAG: Predictor-Guided Neural Architecture Generation with Diffusion Models" by Sohyun An et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their method through extensive experiments on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their validation process. In this section, they explicitly mention using four datasets for their experiments: **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Aircraft, and Oxford-IIIT Pets**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 32x32 color images from 10 general object classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but containing 100 fine-grained classes, with 500 training images and 100 test images per class.
3. **Aircraft**: A fine-grained classification dataset with 10,000 images from 30 aircraft classes.
4. **Oxford-IIIT Pets**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of 37 breeds of pets, with approximately 200 instances per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Aircraft**, the citation is:
  > Subhransu Maji, Esa Rahtu, Juho Kannala, Matthew Blaschko, and Andrea Vedaldi. *Fine-Grained Visual Classification of Aircraft*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2013.

- For **Oxford-IIIT Pets**, the citation is:
  > Omkar M. Parkhi, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman, and C. V. Jawahar. *Cats and Dogs*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and use in future analyses or applications.
