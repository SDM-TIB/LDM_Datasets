To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Trajectory-Aware Transformer for Video Super-Resolution" by Chengxu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are demonstrated on "four widely-used video super-resolution benchmarks," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **REDS Dataset**: This dataset is published in the NTIRE19 challenge and contains a total of 300 video sequences, with 240 for training, 30 for validation, and 30 for testing. Each sequence consists of 100 frames with a resolution of 720 × 1280. The authors specify that they use a subset called **REDS4** for testing.

2. **Vimeo-90K Dataset**: This dataset contains 64,612 sequences for training and 7,824 for testing, with each sequence consisting of seven frames at a resolution of 448 × 256.

In the same section, the authors provide details about how they handle the datasets, including the specific degradation methods applied for evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **REDS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Seungjun Nah, Sungyong Baik, Seokil Hong, Gyeongsik Moon, Sanghyun Son, Radu Timofte, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *NTIRE 2019 challenge on video deblurring and super-resolution: Dataset and study*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 0–0, 2019.

- For the **Vimeo-90K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tianfan Xue, Baian Chen, Jiajun Wu, Donglai Wei, and William T Freeman. *Video enhancement with task-oriented flow*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 127(8):1106–1125, 2019.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included for proper attribution. This will facilitate downstream processing and ensure that the datasets are correctly referenced in any future work.
