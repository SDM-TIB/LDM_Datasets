To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fourier Transformer: Fast Long Range Modeling by Removing Sequence Redundancy with FFT Operator" by Ziwei He et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed model on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors detail their evaluations. In **Section 5.1 (Encoder-only Tasks)**, they mention using the **Long Range Arena (LRA)** benchmark, which consists of several tasks. The specific datasets listed under LRA are:

1. **ListOps**: A dataset of math expressions with sequence lengths up to 2K.
2. **Text**: A byte-level text classification task with a fixed sequence length of 4K.
3. **Retrieval**: A byte-level document retrieval task with a maximum length of 8K.
4. **Image**: An image classification task with a fixed sequence length of 1K.
5. **Pathfinder**: A synthetic image classification task with a fixed input length of 1K.

In **Section 5.2 (Encoder-Decoder Tasks)**, the authors mention two additional datasets:

1. **CNN/DailyMail**: A summarization dataset containing over 280K news articles paired with human-generated summaries.
2. **ELI5**: A question answering dataset containing over 270K question-answer pairs gathered from subreddits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Long Range Arena (LRA)**, the citation is:
  > Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, and Donald Metzler. *Long Range Arena: A Benchmark for Efficient Transformers*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.04006, 2020.

- For **CNN/DailyMail**, the citation is:

- For **ELI5**, the citation is:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
