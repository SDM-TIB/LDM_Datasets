To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Delving Globally into Texture and Structure for Image Inpainting" by Haipeng Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments and the datasets used, which are likely to be detailed in these sections. I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets mentioned, as well as any descriptions that provide context about their content or purpose.

Upon identifying the datasets, I will then refer to the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

From the paper, I note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Paris StreetView (PSV)**: This dataset is referenced in the context of image inpainting and is likely used for evaluating the proposed method.
2. **CelebA-HQ**: Another dataset mentioned, which is commonly used for face-related tasks and may provide a rich source of images for inpainting.
3. **Places2**: This dataset is known for scene recognition and is also utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section:

- For **Paris StreetView (PSV)**, the citation is:
  > Doersch, C., Singh, S., Gupta, A., Sivic, J., & Efros, A. A. (2012). What makes Paris look like Paris? ACM Transactions on Graphics, 31(4), 4.

- For **CelebA-HQ**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 3730–3738.

- For **Places2**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2017). Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(6), 1452–1464.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
