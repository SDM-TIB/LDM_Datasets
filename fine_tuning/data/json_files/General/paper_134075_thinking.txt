To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Innovation-to-Occupations Ontology" by Daniela Elia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the context and significance of their research. They mention leveraging job ads and Wikipedia pages, which suggests that these sources may be part of the datasets used in their study.

In the **methodology section**, the authors detail their approach to populating the ontology and mention a specific dataset of **1,500,000 job postings** scraped from various job portals (Indeed, LinkedIn, Seek) published in Australia, the US, and the UK from March to June 2023. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results section** or **appendices**. The authors may provide insights into how they analyzed the job postings or any supplementary datasets used for comparison or validation.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset identified is:

- **Job Postings Dataset**: 
  > This dataset consists of 1,500,000 job postings scraped from various job portals (Indeed, LinkedIn, Seek) published in Australia, the US, and the UK from March to June 2023.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset, I will note it as part of the research findings.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the job postings dataset as described above.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately.
