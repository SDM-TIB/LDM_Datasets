To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LMFNet: An Efficient Multimodal Fusion Approach for Semantic Segmentation in High-Resolution Remote Sensing" by Tong Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive testing on public datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Analysis)**, where the authors explicitly introduce the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **US3D Dataset**: This dataset is described as a remote sensing semantic stereo dataset containing 26,709 training and validation images and 14,529 test images, each of size 2048 × 2048 pixels. The dataset includes DSM data and a surface classification map with five classes.

2. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset consists of 38 true orthophoto images and corresponding normalized DSM images, with a spatial resolution of 5cm. The authors specify that the dataset includes various land cover categories and that they used specific patches for training and testing.

3. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing patches cut from a large true orthophoto associated with the town of Vaihingen, with a spatial resolution of 9cm. It includes three bands and corresponding DSM data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **US3D Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured and properly attributed.
