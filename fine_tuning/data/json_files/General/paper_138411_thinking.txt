To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InceptionCapsule: Inception-Resnet and CapsuleNet with self-attention for medical image Classification" by Elham Sadeghnezhad and Sajjad Salem, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors used the **Kvasir dataset** and the **BUSI with GT dataset** for evaluation, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **background research** sections for any additional context or details about these datasets. The introduction mentions the Kvasir dataset in relation to gastrointestinal image classification and the BUSI dataset in the context of breast cancer classification. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in the context of the experiments and results, specifically in the sections discussing the performance of the proposed model on these datasets.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Kvasir Dataset**: This dataset is used for gastrointestinal image classification. It contains various classes related to gastrointestinal diseases, and the paper mentions that the proposed model achieved significant accuracy on this dataset.

2. **BUSI with GT Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for breast cancer classification using ultrasound images. The authors report high accuracy and other performance metrics achieved on this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Kvasir dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. A. Pozdeev, N. A. Obukhova, and A. A. Motyko, "Automatic analysis of endoscopic images for polyps detection and segmentation," in 2019 IEEE Conference of Russian Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EIConRus), 2019, pp. 1216-1220: IEEE.

- For the **BUSI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ä°. PACAL, "Deep learning approaches for classification of breast cancer in ultrasound (US) images," Journal of the Institute of Science and Technology, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 1917-1927, 2022.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper and provide proper references for them.
