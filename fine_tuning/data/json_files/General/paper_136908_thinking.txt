To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DOEPatch: Dynamically Optimized Ensemble Model for Adversarial Patches Generation" by Wenyi Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** to see if the authors discuss any datasets that are foundational to their work or that they reference in the context of adversarial attacks on object detection models.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for details about the datasets used for training and testing the adversarial patches. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their size, content, and relevance to the experiments conducted.

I will also examine the **experiments section** to identify any datasets that were specifically used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. This section often contains crucial information about the datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Inria Person Dataset**: This dataset is likely used for training and testing the adversarial patches, as it is a common dataset for person detection tasks.

I will look for the full citation for the Inria Person Dataset, which is typically referenced in the paper. The citation format usually includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
