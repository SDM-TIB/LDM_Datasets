To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing the Dilemma of Performance and Index Size in Billion-Scale Vector Search and Breaking It with Second-Tier Memory" by Rongxin Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of vector searches on large-scale datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Setup, datasets and baseline indexes)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SPACEV**: This dataset contains 1 billion vectors, with a total space of 94 GB, and each vector is represented as 100-dimensional integers (int8). The query set consists of 29,000 queries.

2. **BIGANN**: This dataset also contains 1 billion vectors, with a total space of 120 GB, and each vector is represented as 128-dimensional unsigned integers (uint8). The query set consists of 10,000 queries.

3. **DEEP**: This dataset contains 1 billion vectors, with a total space of 358 GB, and each vector is represented as 96-dimensional floating-point numbers (float32). The query set consists of 10,000 queries.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly used in the field and may not have specific papers associated with them, I will note that they are standard datasets in vector search research.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, dimensions, total space, and query set sizes, along with the appropriate citations or notes regarding their common usage in the field.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all relevant information is captured accurately for further processing or review.
