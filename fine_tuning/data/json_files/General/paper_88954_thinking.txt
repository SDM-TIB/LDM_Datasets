To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ILCRO: Making Importance Landscapes Flat Again" by Vincent Moens et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research but may not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their training dynamics but do not explicitly mention any datasets. I will then move to the **methods section**, where the authors describe their approach and any datasets used for experiments.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors mention that they tested their regularized objective on two well-known classification tasks: **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: The citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

2. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211â€“252. doi:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR-100**: A dataset of 50,000 training and 10,000 validation images.
- **ImageNet**: A dataset with over a million images for training and 50,000 images for validation.

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset in the final output.
