To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparse Variational Contaminated Noise Gaussian Process Regression for Forecasting Geomagnetic Perturbations" by Daniel Iong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of geomagnetic perturbation measurements from various ground magnetometer stations, which indicates that there is a dataset involved. I will note this as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 1 (Introduction)** and **section 4 (Experiments)**. In the introduction, the authors refer to geomagnetic perturbation measurements obtained from SuperMAG, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their analysis.

I will then check **section 5 (Applications)**, where the authors describe their application of the model to real-world data. They mention using geomagnetic perturbations data (δBH) from twelve test stations, which further confirms the existence of a dataset. The paper also states that the data is stored in Parquet files and provides details about the features used for prediction.

To ensure I have the correct dataset citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here, I will look for the full citation for the SuperMAG dataset. The citation is as follows:

- For the **SuperMAG dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jesper W. Gjerloev. The SuperMAG data processing technique. *Journal of Geophysical Research*, 117, 2012.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention using solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements obtained from NASA’s OMNIWeb as drivers for their model. I will check the references for this dataset as well:

- For the **OMNI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Natalia E. Papitashvili and Joseph H. King. OMNI 1-min Data. NASA Space Physics Data Facility, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **SuperMAG dataset**: Geomagnetic perturbation measurements from various ground magnetometer stations.
   - Citation: Jesper W. Gjerloev. The SuperMAG data processing technique. *Journal of Geophysical Research*, 117, 2012.

2. **OMNI dataset**: Solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements.
   - Citation: Natalia E. Papitashvili and Joseph H. King. OMNI 1-min Data. NASA Space Physics Data Facility, 2020.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
