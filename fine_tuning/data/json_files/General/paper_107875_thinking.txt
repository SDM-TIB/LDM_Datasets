To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Downlink Precoding for FBMC-based Massive MIMO with Imperfect Channel Reciprocity" by Hamed Hosseiny et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on precoding methods and mentions numerical evaluations, which may imply the use of datasets for simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section V) closely, as this is where datasets are most likely to be mentioned. In this section, the authors describe their simulation setup, including the use of a specific channel model (the Tap delay line-C (TDL-C) from the 5G channel model) and parameters for generating channels. This indicates that the authors are using a dataset related to channel modeling.

I will also check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets or models used in the study. The references may provide full citations for the datasets or models mentioned in the paper.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **5G Channel Model (Tap Delay Line-C)**: This model is used to generate channels for the simulations. The paper references the model as providing a Power Delay Profile (PDP) based on a normalized root mean square (RMS) delay spread.

The full citation for the 5G channel model is:
   > 3GPP, “Channel model for frequencies from 0.5 to 100GHz,” 3GPP TR 38.901 version 14.0.0 Release 14, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the identified dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After completing this process, I will have a structured output that includes the dataset information and its citation, ready for further use or analysis.
