To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DFNet: Enhance Absolute Pose Regression with Direct Feature Matching" by Shuai Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a camera relocalization pipeline and improvements in pose regression accuracy, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the evaluation of their methods.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **7-Scenes Dataset**: This dataset is described as consisting of seven indoor scenes, each containing a varying number of training and validation samples. The paper states that it is used for evaluating the performance of their method.

2. **Cambridge Landmarks Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of outdoor scenes, with details about the number of training samples available for each scene.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **7-Scenes Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shotton, J., Glocker, B., Zach, C., Izadi, S., Criminisi, A., & Fitzgibbon, A. (2013). Scene coordinate regression forests for camera relocalization in RGB-D images. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- For the **Cambridge Landmarks Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kendall, A., & Cipolla, R. (2015). PoseNet: A convolutional network for real-time 6-DOF camera relocalization. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
