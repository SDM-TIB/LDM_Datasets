To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Full-Stack Search Technique for Domain Optimized Deep Learning Accelerators" by Dan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but the introduction often contains specific mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention evaluating their framework on several state-of-the-art models, including EfficientNet and BERT. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets associated with these models.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors evaluate their method on the following datasets:

1. **EfficientNet**: The authors reference the EfficientNet models, which are evaluated on the ImageNet dataset. This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **BERT**: The authors mention using the BERT model, which is typically evaluated on datasets like the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) for natural language processing tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Liu, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383â€“2392, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
