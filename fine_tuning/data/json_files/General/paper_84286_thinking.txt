To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Rate-Distortion Framework for Explaining Neural Network Decisions" by Jan Macdonald et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions "numerical experiments for two image classification datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used in the research. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will proceed to the **experiments section (Section 5)**, where the authors describe their numerical experiments. Here, they specifically mention using two datasets: 

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is widely known for handwritten digit recognition and consists of grayscale images of digits. The authors mention that they trained a convolutional neural network on this dataset.

2. **STL-10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for image classification and contains color images of various objects. The authors indicate that they retrained a VGG-16 network on this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, November 1998.

- For the **STL-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, volume 15 of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, pages 215–223, Fort Lauderdale, FL, USA, April 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets utilized in the research along with their proper citations.
