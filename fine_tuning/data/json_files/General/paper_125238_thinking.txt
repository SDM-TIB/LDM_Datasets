To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Fake Generated Scientific Abstracts" by Panagiotis C. Theocharopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the GPT-3 model to generate scientific paper abstracts and indicates that the study involves analyzing various text representation methods. This suggests that there may be datasets related to both the generated abstracts and the original scientific papers.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. In this case, the authors describe the creation of an AI-generated dataset based on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). They state that they randomly selected a subset of 14,331 English-language papers with both titles and abstracts from this dataset. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

I will also check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about the dataset used for generating AI abstracts. The authors mention that they used the GPT-3 model to create a database of AI-generated abstracts, which is derived from the CORD-19 dataset. This reinforces the importance of the CORD-19 dataset in their research.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the CORD-19 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is as follows:
> Lucy Lu Wang, Kyle Lo, Yoganand Chandrasekhar, Russell Reas, Jiangjiang Yang, Doug Burdick, Darrin Eide, Kathryn Funk, Yannis Katsis, Rodney Michael Kinney, Yunyao Li, Ziyang Liu, William Merrill, Paul Mooney, Dewey A. Murdick, Devvret Rishi, Jerry Sheehan, Zhihong Shen, Brandon Stilson, Alex D. Wade, Kuansan Wang, Nancy Xin Ru Wang, Christopher Wilhelm, Boya Xie, Douglas M. Raymond, Daniel S. Weld, Oren Etzioni, and Sebastian Kohlmeier. *CORD-19: The COVID-19 open research dataset*. In Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on NLP for COVID-19 at ACL 2020, Online, July 2020. Association for Computational Linguistics.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the CORD-19 dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citation is included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
