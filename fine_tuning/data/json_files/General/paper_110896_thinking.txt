To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Task Text Classification using Graph Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Low Resource Language" by Mounika Marreddy et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of an annotated Telugu dataset called **TEL-NLP** for four NLP tasks: sentiment analysis (SA), emotion identification (EI), hate-speech detection (HS), and sarcasm detection (SAR). This indicates that a dataset is indeed present and needs to be described.

Next, I will look into **section III (TEL-NLP DETAILS)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the TEL-NLP dataset. They explain the dataset creation process, the number of samples for each task, and the inter-annotator agreement. The TEL-NLP dataset consists of:

1. **Sentiment Analysis (SA)**: 16,234 samples with two classes (Positive and Negative).
2. **Emotion Identification (EI)**: 9,675 samples with four classes (Fear, Angry, Sad, Happy).
3. **Hate Speech (HS)**: 16,234 samples with two classes (Yes and No).
4. **Sarcasm Detection (SAR)**: 16,234 samples with two classes (Yes and No).

The dataset creation involved sampling sentences from a large Telugu corpus and annotating them through a web-based interface by native speakers of Telugu.

After identifying the dataset, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the TEL-NLP dataset. The authors reference their previous work for the Telugu dataset creation, which is:

- Marreddy, M., Oota, S. R., Vakada, L. S., Chinni, V. C., & Mamidi, R. (2021). Clickbait detection in Telugu: Overcoming NLP challenges in resource-poor languages using benchmarked techniques. In *2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)* (pp. 1â€“8). IEEE.

Now that I have the dataset details and the citation, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Examine the relevant section detailing the dataset (TEL-NLP).
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

This methodical approach ensures that I accurately capture all necessary information regarding the dataset mentioned in the paper.
