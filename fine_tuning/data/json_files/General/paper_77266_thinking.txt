To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ClosNets: a Priori Sparse Topologies for Faster DNN Training" by Mihailo Isakov and Michel A. Kinsy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of fully-connected layers in DNNs but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will look for references to datasets in the introduction and methodology.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for reducing the size of dense layers but do not specify any datasets used for their experiments. I will continue to the **architecture and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are referenced there.

Upon reviewing the **architecture section**, I find that the authors mention testing their Clos networks on various configurations but do not provide specific datasets. I will check the **conclusion** and **references** sections for any mentions of datasets.

After thoroughly examining the paper, I notice that there are no explicit datasets mentioned for training or evaluation in the text. The authors focus on the theoretical aspects of their proposed Clos networks and do not provide empirical results based on specific datasets.

Since no datasets are identified in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will note that the authors reference several works related to deep learning techniques and optimizations, which may imply the use of standard datasets in the field, but these are not explicitly stated.

In summary, I will conclude that this paper does not provide specific datasets for extraction, and therefore, there are no dataset citations to compile. If I were to summarize the findings, I would note the absence of dataset references in the paper.
