To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Use of Co-data through Empirical Bayes for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees" by Jeroen M. Goedhart et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for validation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their experiments and the data they utilized. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, especially in subsections that discuss simulations or applications.

In the **results section**, the authors may refer to datasets again, particularly when discussing the outcomes of their experiments. This could provide additional context or confirm the datasets previously mentioned.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

From my reading, I have identified the following datasets:

1. **DLBCL Cohort**: This dataset consists of 101 uniformly treated Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients, used to predict two-year progression-free survival based on various covariates, including clinical and omics data.

2. **Co-data from Previous DLBCL Studies**: This dataset includes external information on covariates, specifically p-values associated with the binary response from a larger cohort of 430 previously published DLBCL patients.

3. **Simulated Datasets**: The authors conducted simulations to evaluate their method, generating 500 datasets based on specified functions and covariate structures.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited according to the conventions used in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
