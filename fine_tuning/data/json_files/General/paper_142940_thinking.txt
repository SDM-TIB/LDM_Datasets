To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GREEN: Generative Radiology Report Evaluation and Error Notation" by Sophie Ostmeier et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the introduction of the GREEN metric and mentions validation against various datasets, which suggests that datasets are present.

Next, I will focus on the **datasets section** (which is likely to be in the methods or results sections). Here, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for developing their models. They state that they compiled a dataset encompassing **100,000 annotations from GPT-4 related to chest X-rays** and **50,000 annotations across diverse imaging modalities**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets to extract.

I will then look for specific details about these datasets, including their sources and any relevant characteristics. The paper mentions that the training dataset was created from six publicly available de-identified chest X-ray datasets, which are:

1. **MIMIC-CXR**: Johnson et al., 2019.
2. **MIMIC-PRO**: Ramesh et al., 2022.
3. **CandidPTX**: Feng et al., 2021.
4. **PadChest**: Bustos et al., 2020.
5. **BIMCV-covid19**: Vayá et al., 2020.
6. **OpenI**: Demner-Fushman et al., 2012.

In addition to these, the authors mention using **MIMIC-IV Radiology Reports** (Johnson et al., 2023) and other specialized datasets for training their models.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
