To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prune and distill: similar reformatting of image information along rat visual cortex and deep neural networks" by Paolo Muratore et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will need to look for specific dataset names and details in the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the relationship between deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the rat visual cortex, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will need to continue to the methods section for more detailed information.

In **section 2.1 (Analysis of neural data)**, the authors refer to a dataset recorded by another study ([14]), which consists of extracellular neuronal responses from four visual cortical areas in rats. This dataset is crucial for their analysis of intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of object representations. I will note this dataset and look for its full citation in the references.

Next, in **section 2.2 (Dataset, network architecture and estimation of the mutual information between unit activation and image properties)**, the authors mention using the **ILSVRC2012 ImageNet validation dataset** for their experiments with the VGG-16 network. This is another important dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the dataset referenced as [14], which is crucial for the analysis of the rat visual cortex, the citation is:
   > Sina Tafazoli et al. "Emergence of transformation-tolerant representations of visual objects in rat lateral extrastriate cortex." *Elife* 6 (2017): e22794.

2. For the **ILSVRC2012 ImageNet validation dataset**, the citation is:
   > Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman. "Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition." *arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.1556* (2014).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
