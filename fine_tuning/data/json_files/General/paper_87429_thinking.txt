To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Translationese as a Language in 'Multilingual' NMT" by Parker Riley et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a sentence-level classifier trained to distinguish translationese from original text, which suggests that there are datasets involved in this classification task. The introduction further discusses the lack of original-to-original sentence pairs, indicating that the authors likely utilized specific datasets to address this issue.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that describe the data used in their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using **News Crawl data from WMT** as target-original data. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors detail their use of **WMT 2014 and WMT 2018 bitext** for English-to-German and English-to-French translations. They also mention filtering and processing this data, which indicates its importance in their methodology.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations I need to extract include:

1. **WMT News Crawl Data**:
   > WMT (2018). *WMT News Crawl*. Retrieved from http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/translation-task.html

2. **WMT 2014 English-French Bitext**:
   > WMT (2014). *WMT 2014 English-French Translation Task*. Retrieved from http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html

3. **WMT 2018 English-German Bitext**:
   > WMT (2018). *WMT 2018 English-German Translation Task*. Retrieved from http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/translation-task.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
