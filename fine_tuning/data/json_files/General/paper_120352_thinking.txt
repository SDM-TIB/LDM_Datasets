To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolution-enhanced Evolving Attention Networks" by Yujing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves superior performance in various applications, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsections that detail the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For instance, if the authors refer to specific datasets for time-series representation, natural language understanding, or image classification, I will note these down.

In the **experiments section**, I will also check for tables or figures that summarize the datasets used, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their names and key statistics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe each dataset in detail.

For example, if the paper mentions the "Monash Time Series Regression Archive," I will find the corresponding citation, which might look something like this:
> C. W. Tan, C. Bergmeir, F. Petitjean, and G. I. Webb. *Monash University, UEA, UCR Time Series Extrinsic Regression Archive*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.10996, 2020.

Similarly, if the paper discusses datasets like "GLUE" or "ImageNet," I will ensure to retrieve their full citations as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all datasets mentioned in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the research process.
