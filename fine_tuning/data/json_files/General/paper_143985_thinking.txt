To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting the Layered Intrinsic Dimensionality of Deep Models for Practical Adversarial Training" by Enes Altinisik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any text that describes their characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention three datasets used for robustifying sentiment classifiers: 

1. **AG-News Corpus (AGNEWS)**: This dataset contains over 120,000 samples categorized into four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech.
2. **Internet Movie Database (IMDB)**: This dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled with binary sentiments (positive or negative).
3. **Yelp Review Polarity (YELP)**: This dataset contains nearly 600,000 samples of Yelp reviews with binary labels, although only a subset of 63,000 samples was used in the experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention two datasets used for evaluating safety filters: 

1. **AdvBench**: A dataset designed for evaluating the robustness of safety filters against adversarial attacks.
2. **Helpfulness-Harmfulness Human Preference dataset (HH-RLHF)**: This dataset includes prompts classified as harmful or helpful.

I will now check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For **AGNEWS**, the citation is:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:

- For **Yelp**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Xiang, Junbo Zhao, and Yann LeCun. "Character-level convolutional networks for text classification." In NeurIPS, 2015.

- For **AdvBench**, the citation is:
  > Zou, Andy, Zifan Wang, J Zico Kolter, and Matt Fredrikson. "Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models." arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.15043, 2023.

- For **HH-RLHF**, the citation is:
  > Bai, Yuntao, et al. "Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback." arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.05862, 2022.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
