To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Quadratic Penalties in Elastic Weight Consolidation" by Ferenc HuszÃ¡r, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) algorithm but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments or applications of the EWC algorithm. I will look for any mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay special attention to any **equations or examples** that might reference datasets indirectly, as well as any **footnotes or citations** that could lead to dataset information.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. If the authors refer to datasets in the context of previous works, I will note those citations as well.

If I find any datasets mentioned, I will ensure to extract the following details for each:

1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which may include authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for the citation that describes it, such as:

> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper, ready for further processing or review.
