To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of NOMA and CoMP Implementation Order on the Performance of Ultra-Dense Networks" by Akhileswar Chowdary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses various technologies but does not provide dataset names either.

Next, I will examine **section IV (Results and Discussions)**, which often contains details about the datasets used for simulations or experiments. In this section, the authors discuss simulation setups and parameters, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets. Instead, they refer to simulation parameters and configurations, which may imply the use of synthetic data rather than publicly available datasets.

Since no specific datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets. The references primarily consist of papers discussing methodologies and technologies related to NOMA and CoMP but do not provide direct citations for datasets.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract for this particular research paper. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are identified in the text.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for any dataset mentions.
2. Analyzing the results section for details on datasets used in simulations.
3. Reviewing the references for any potential dataset citations.

Since no datasets were found, I will document this finding accordingly.
