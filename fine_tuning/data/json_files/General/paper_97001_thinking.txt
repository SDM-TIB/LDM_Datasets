To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Studying Strategically: Learning to Mask for Closed-book QA" by Qinyuan Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their full citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on closed-book question-answering (QA) and mention the use of an intermediate pre-training stage, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the importance of various datasets for training and evaluating their models. They reference "TriviaQA" and "Natural Questions" as key datasets, which I will note down for further details.

In **section 4 (Experiments)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention three open-domain QA benchmarks:
1. **Natural Questions (NQ)**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for question answering research.
2. **WebQuestions (WQ)**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluating their approach.
3. **TriviaQA (TQA)**: This dataset is highlighted as particularly beneficial for their method.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Natural Questions (NQ)**, the citation is:
  > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, J., Lee, K., Toutanova, K., Jones, L., Kelcey, M., Dai, A. M., Uszkoreit, J., Le, Q., & Petrov, S. (2019). *Natural questions: A benchmark for question answering research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 453-466.

- For **WebQuestions (WQ)**, the citation is:
  > Berant, J., Chou, A., Frostig, R., & Liang, P. (2013). *Semantic parsing on Freebase from question-answer pairs*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1533-1544.

- For **TriviaQA (TQA)**, the citation is:
  > Joshi, M., Chen, D., Liu, Y., Weld, D. S., Zettlemoyer, L. (2017). *TriviaQA: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1601-1611.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
