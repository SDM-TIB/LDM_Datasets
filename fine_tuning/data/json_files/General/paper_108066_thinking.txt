To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Error Correction in ASR using Sequence-to-Sequence Models" by Samrat Dutta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of an augmented dataset for training, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of unavailability of supervised training data for ASR error correction. This indicates that they may have created or used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. Here, they mention using the **Common Voice corpus** for training their ASR error correction model. They specify that they used around 119K accented audio clips and transcriptions, which is a significant dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and analysis sections**. In the **grammatical error correction task**, the authors refer to the **HiWikEd dataset** as a test set for evaluating their model's performance on grammatical errors. This dataset is derived from Hindi Wikipedia and is specifically curated for this task.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **Common Voice corpus**, the citation is:
   > Rosana Ardila, Megan Branson, Kelly Davis, Michael Henretty, Michael Kohler, Josh Meyer, Reuben Morais, Lindsay Saunders, Francis M Tyers, and Gregor Weber. *Common voice: A massively multilingual speech corpus*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1912.06670, 2019.

2. For the **HiWikEd dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ankur Sonawane, Sujeet Kumar Vishwakarma, Bhavana Srivastava, and Anil Kumar Singh. *Generating inflectional errors for grammatical error correction in Hindi*. In Proceedings of the 1st Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 10th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing: Student Research Workshop, pages 165â€“171, 2020.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
