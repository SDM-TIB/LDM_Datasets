To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Riesz-Quincunx-Unet Variational Auto-Encoder for Satellite Image Denoising" by Duy H. Thai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **Sentinel-2 satellite images** and **National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) images**, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. Here, they specify:

1. **Sentinel-2 Satellite Images**: The paper states that these images are processed as part of the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset obtained from USGS DAAC. The authors mention that the dataset includes 510 images created with a size of 256×256 pixels, focusing on the HLS tile covering Northern Virginia from 2016 to 2020.

2. **NAIP Images**: The authors describe using NAIP images that coincide with high-resolution ground truth land cover data. They mention that the dataset contains six classes of land cover, which were grouped into three classes for segmentation experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Sentinel-2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Claverie, M., Ju, J., Masek, J. G., Dungan, J. L., Vermote, E. F., Roger, J.-C., Skakun, S. V., & Justice, C. (2018). The harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance dataset. *Remote Sensing of Environment*, 219, 145–161.

- For the **NAIP dataset**, the citation is:
  > National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). (2015). NAIP information sheet. Retrieved from https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSAFile/naipinfosheet2015.pdf.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
