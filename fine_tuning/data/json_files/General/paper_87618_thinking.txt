To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improve CAM with Auto-adapted Segmentation and Co-supervised Augmentation" by Ziyi Kou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the final model achieves superior performance on **CUB-200** and **ILSVRC** datasets, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention testing their model on the **ILSVRC2016 validation set** and the **CUB-200-2011 test set**. This confirms that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Now, I will gather detailed information about these datasets from the paper. The authors describe the **ILSVRC** dataset as containing over 1.2 million images across 1,000 categories, with a validation set of 50,000 images. The **CUB-200-2011** dataset is described as containing 11,788 bird images across 200 classes, with 5,994 images for training and 5,794 for testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations I find are:

- For **CUB-200-2011**:

- For **ILSVRC**:

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper:

1. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: Contains 11,788 bird images across 200 classes, with 5,994 images for training and 5,794 for testing.
   - Citation: Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 Dataset*. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
