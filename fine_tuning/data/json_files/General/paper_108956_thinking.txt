To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluating State of the Art, Forecasting Ensembles- and Meta-learning Strategies for Model Fusion" by Pieter Cawood and Terence van Zyl, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **M4 forecasting dataset**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the **Materials and Methods** section provides a comprehensive overview of the **M4 Forecasting Competition**, which includes the dataset details. The authors describe the M4 dataset as containing **100,000 time-series** of various frequencies (yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly) and provide a summary of the number of series per frequency and domain.

I will note the key details about the M4 dataset:
- It includes time-series data from various domains such as Economic, Finance, Demographics, and Industries.
- The dataset is available for free on GitHub.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the M4 dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., & Assimakopoulos, V. (2020). The M4 competition: 100,000 time series and 61 forecasting methods. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 36(1), 54-74.

Additionally, I will confirm that the authors mention the dataset's availability and provide a link to the GitHub repository where it can be accessed.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the M4 dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format for further processing or review.
