To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIVIDED SPECTRO-TEMPORAL ATTENTION FOR SOUND EVENT LOCALIZATION AND DETECTION IN REAL SCENES FOR DCASE2023 CHALLENGE" by Yusun Shul et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **STARSS23 development dataset** for testing their proposed method, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look into **section 2.2 (External Data)**, where the authors discuss the **AudioSet** dataset, which is used to synthesize external data for training. This section provides important details about the dataset's purpose and how it is utilized in their experiments.

In **section 2.1 (Implementation Details)**, the authors mention the **STARSS23** dataset again, confirming its role in their experiments. They describe the audio format and preprocessing steps, which further emphasizes the dataset's significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **STARSS23 dataset**, the citation is:
   > A. Politis, K. Shimada, P. Sudarsanam, A. Hakala, S. Takahashi, D. A. Krause, N. Takahashi, S. Adavanne, Y. Koyama, K. Uchida, Y. Mitsufuji, and T. Virtanen. "STARSS23: Sony-TAu Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023." Mar. 2023. [Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7880637

2. For the **AudioSet dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. F. Gemmeke, D. P. W. Ellis, D. Freedman, A. Jansen, W. Lawrence, R. C. Moore, M. Plakal, and M. Ritter. "Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events." In 2017 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2017, pp. 776â€“780.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **STARSS23 Dataset**: Used for sound event localization and detection, providing real recordings captured in various room environments.
- **AudioSet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used to synthesize external data for training, ensuring a balanced representation of sound events.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
