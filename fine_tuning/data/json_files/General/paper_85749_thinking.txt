To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Camera Pose Correction in SLAM Based on Bias Values of Map Points" by Zhaobing Kang, Wei Zou, and Zheng Zhu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experimental results were obtained on benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors mention evaluating their method on the **EuroC dataset**. This is a clear indication that this dataset is used for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the EuroC dataset. The relevant citation is:
> M. Burri et al., “The EuRoC micro aerial vehicle datasets”, International Journal of Robotics Research, vol. 35, no. 10, pp. 1157-1163, 2016.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the EuroC dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear entry for the EuroC dataset that is ready for review or further processing.
