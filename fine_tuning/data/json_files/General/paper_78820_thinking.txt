To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Tracking Cardiac Magnetic Resonance via Deep Learning and Spline Optimization" by Davis M. Vigneault et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were performed using data from **42 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 21 healthy control subjects**. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to these subjects.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **methods section**, particularly in the subsections that describe the segmentation and tracking processes. In the **experiments section**, the authors detail how they segmented and tracked cardiac structures, which may provide insights into the datasets used.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors manually segmented the LV myocardium, LV blood-pool, and RV blood-pool in **189 short axis 2D+time volumes** from **63 subjects**. This indicates that the dataset consists of these specific volumes and subjects.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide specific dataset names or external references for the datasets used, but it does mention the number of subjects and the types of images processed.

Since the datasets are derived from clinical subjects, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset of Patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)**: This dataset includes cardiac magnetic resonance images from **42 patients** diagnosed with HCM.

2. **Dataset of Healthy Control Subjects**: This dataset includes cardiac magnetic resonance images from **21 healthy control subjects**.

For the full citations, since the paper does not provide specific external datasets or their citations, I will note that the datasets are derived from clinical subjects and do not have formal citations like publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their relevance to the study, even if they do not have formal citations.
