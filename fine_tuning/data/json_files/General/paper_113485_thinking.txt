To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Outage-based Beamforming Design for Dual-Functional Radar-Communication 6G Systems" by Ahmad Bazzi and Marwa Chaﬁi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical simulations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any tables or figures that might summarize the datasets or their outcomes. This could provide additional context about the datasets and their relevance to the research findings.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "XYZ Dataset" used for simulations, I will look for the citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Publisher/Journal, Year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.
