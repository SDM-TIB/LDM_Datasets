To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Construction of Domain-specified Japanese Large Language Model for Finance through Continual Pre-training" by Masanori Hirano and Kentaro Imajo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed Japanese financial-focused datasets for continual pre-training, which suggests that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Tuning Method and Experiments)**, particularly subsection B, which is dedicated to the **Japanese Financial Focused Datasets**. Here, the authors describe the datasets they constructed for pre-training. They mention that they crawled articles from the Internet and cleaned them, which indicates a significant effort in dataset preparation.

The paper lists the types of documents included in the datasets, such as:

1. **Speeches, Press Conferences, and Talks of Officers of the Bank of Japan**
2. **Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meetings of the Bank of Japan**
3. **Reports, glossaries, and company profiles from multiple financial institutions**
4. **Financial-related documents extracted from Wikipedia**
5. **Reports on EDInet via their API services**

The authors also mention that the final datasets contain about **8.1 million documents and 370 million tokens**, which is crucial information for understanding the scale of the datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. The paper references several works that may provide context or additional information about the datasets used, but it does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves.

Since the datasets are constructed from publicly available documents and articles, I will note that while specific citations for the datasets may not be provided, the authors have ensured that the datasets are clear to use for commercial purposes under Japanese law as of April 2024.

Finally, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and any necessary citations for the sources of the documents used in the dataset construction.

In summary, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **Japanese Financial-Focused Datasets**: Comprising various types of financial documents, including speeches, meeting minutes, reports, and Wikipedia extracts.

I will ensure to document the details of the datasets and any relevant citations from the references section that pertain to the methodologies or previous works related to the datasets.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
