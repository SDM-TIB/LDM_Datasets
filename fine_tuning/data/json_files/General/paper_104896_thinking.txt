To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PARE: A Simple and Strong Baseline for Monolingual and Multilingual Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction" by Vipul Rathore et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on four datasets, which suggests that I should look for specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list the datasets as follows:

1. **NYT-10d**: This dataset is described as the most popular dataset for monolingual distantly supervised relation extraction, constructed by aligning Freebase entities to the New York Times Corpus. It has a total of 694k instances with a test set of 172k instances.

2. **NYT-10m**: This dataset is a more recent release that aims to address issues with NYT-10d. It has a total of 474k instances and includes a manually annotated test set of 9.74k instances.

3. **Wiki-20m**: Another recent dataset for training and evaluating models, with a total of 901k instances and a manually annotated test set corresponding to the Wiki80 dataset.

4. **DiS-ReX**: A multilingual dataset for distantly supervised relation extraction, which includes instances from multiple languages. The dataset has a total of 1.84M instances and a test set of 334k instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
