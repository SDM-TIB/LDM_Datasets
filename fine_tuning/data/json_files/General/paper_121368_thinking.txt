To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DIFAI: DIVERSE FACIAL INPAINTING USING STYLEGAN INVERSION" by Dongsik Yoon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a framework for diverse facial inpainting and references the **CelebA-HQ dataset** as part of their experiments. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their methods using the **CelebA-HQ dataset** and also mention the **Quickdraw irregular mask dataset**. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. 

1. For the **CelebA-HQ dataset**, the citation is:
   > Andrew Brock, Jeff Donahue, and Karen Simonyan. *Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis*. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

2. For the **Quickdraw irregular mask dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ha, J., & Kim, J. (2018). *Quick, Draw!*. In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI '18). ACM, New York, NY, USA, Article 1, 1-12.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CelebA-HQ**: A high-quality dataset for facial image synthesis, containing images of celebrities with various attributes.
- **Quickdraw irregular mask dataset**: A dataset used for generating irregular masks, enhancing the robustness of inpainting methods.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
