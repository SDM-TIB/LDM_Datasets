To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ranking a set of objects: a graph based least-square approach" by Evgenia Christoforou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their algorithms. In this paper, the authors mention testing their algorithms on **real-world datasets**, specifically referencing the **English Premier League** data as a case study. This indicates that there is at least one dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that may have been used in simulations or comparisons. The authors discuss their algorithms' performance using synthetic datasets, but they primarily focus on the real-world dataset from the English Premier League.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references other works that may provide additional datasets or context for the datasets used. However, since the primary dataset is the English Premier League data, I will focus on that.

The citation for the English Premier League dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can summarize it as follows:
- **English Premier League Dataset**: This dataset includes match data for football teams over several seasons, where nodes represent teams and edges represent matches between them. The dataset is used to evaluate the proposed ranking algorithms.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the English Premier League dataset, I will note that it is commonly available through sports analytics platforms or official league statistics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I include the necessary details and citations for each dataset identified in the paper. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented for future reference or analysis.
