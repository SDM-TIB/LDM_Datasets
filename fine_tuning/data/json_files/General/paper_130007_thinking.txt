To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AMAE: Adaptation of Pre-Trained Masked Autoencoder for Dual-Distribution Anomaly Detection in Chest X-Rays" by Behzad Bozorgtabar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on three public chest X-ray benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. They mention three datasets:

1. **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset**: This dataset is used for detecting pneumonia in chest X-rays and is available on Kaggle.

2. **VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection Challenge dataset (VinDr-CXR)**: This dataset contains chest X-rays with annotations from radiologists and is also available on Kaggle.

3. **NIH Chest X-ray dataset (NIH-CXR)**: The authors specify that they used a curated subset of this dataset, which includes only posteroanterior view images of patients aged over 18.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge. *Kaggle*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge.

- For the **VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nguyen, H.Q., Lam, K., Le, L.T., Pham, H.H., Tran, D.Q., Nguyen, D.B., Le, D.D., Pham, C.M., Tong, H.T., Dinh, D.H., et al. *Vindr-cxr: An open dataset of chest x-rays with radiologistâ€™s annotations*. Scientific Data 9(1), 429 (2022).

- For the **NIH Chest X-ray dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wang, X., Yoon, J., Gupta, A., et al. *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest X-ray dataset and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
