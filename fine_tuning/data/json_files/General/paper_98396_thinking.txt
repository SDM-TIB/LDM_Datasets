To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Consistency Regularization for Semi-Supervised Transfer Learning" by Abulikemu Abuduweili et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on popular benchmarks, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section (4.1)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list several datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 images across 10 classes, commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset contains 200 fine-grained classes of birds with a total of 11,788 images, which is often used for fine-grained classification tasks.

3. **MIT Indoor-67**: A dataset with 67 scene categories, where each category has 80 images for training and 20 for testing.

4. **MURA**: A dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs containing 40,561 images from 14,863 patient studies, used for distinguishing normal from abnormal studies.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

- For **MIT Indoor-67**, the citation is:
  > Ariadna Quattoni and Antonio Torralba. *Recognizing indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 413–420. IEEE, 2009.

- For **MURA**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jeremy Irvin, Aarti Bagul, Daisy Ding, Tony Duan, Hershel Mehta, Brandon Yang, Kaylie Zhu, Dillon Laird, Robyn L Ball, et al. *MURA dataset: Towards radiologist-level abnormality detection in musculoskeletal radiographs*. Hand, 1(602):2–215.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
