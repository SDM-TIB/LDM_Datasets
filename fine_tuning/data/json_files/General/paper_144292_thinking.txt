To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PATIENT-Ψ: Using Large Language Models to Simulate Patients for Training Mental Health Professionals" by Ruiyi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the construction of diverse patient cognitive models, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to these models.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by mental health professionals and the need for effective training tools. They mention the creation of a dataset called **PATIENT-Ψ-CM**, which is a key dataset for their proposed framework.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the construction of the PATIENT-Ψ framework. They detail how the **PATIENT-Ψ-CM** dataset was created, including the involvement of clinical psychologists and the number of cognitive models included in the dataset. This section provides essential details about the dataset's content and purpose.

The **results section** may also provide insights into how the dataset was evaluated or utilized in experiments, confirming its significance in the study.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset:

1. **PATIENT-Ψ-CM**: This dataset comprises 106 high-quality and diverse patient cognitive models created by clinical psychologists. It covers various unhealthy cognitive structures in contexts such as family issues, relationship problems, and workplace challenges.

Next, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the foundational work on cognitive models in CBT, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's theoretical background.

The citation for the foundational work is:
- Beck, J. S. (2020). *Cognitive behavior therapy: Basics and beyond*. Guilford Publications.

Additionally, I will note that the dataset was inspired by therapy session transcripts obtained from the Alexander Street database, which is also relevant for citation purposes.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's name, description, and citations, ready for structured output or further processing.
