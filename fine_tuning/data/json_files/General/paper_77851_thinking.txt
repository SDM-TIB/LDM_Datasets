To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting and classifying lesions in mammograms with Deep Learning" by Dezső Ribli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **INbreast dataset** and the **Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)**, indicating that these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **material and methods** sections for more details about these datasets. In the material and methods section, the authors provide specific information about the datasets used for training and testing their model. They mention:

1. **Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)**: This dataset contains 2,620 digitized film-screen screening mammography exams with pixel-level ground truth annotations of lesions.

2. **INbreast Dataset**: This dataset includes 115 FFDM cases with pixel-level ground truth annotations and histological proof for cancers.

3. **Dataset from Semmelweis University**: This dataset contains 847 FFDM images from 214 exams, but it is not publicly available.

I will also check the **data availability** section to confirm the accessibility of these datasets and to find their respective citations.

For the **DDSM**, the citation is:
> Heath, M., Bowyer, K., Kopans, D., Moore, R., & Kegelmeyer, W. P. (2000). *The digital database for screening mammography*. In Proceedings of the 5th international workshop on digital mammography, 212–218. Medical Physics Publishing.

For the **INbreast dataset**, the citation is:
> Moreira, I. C., et al. (2012). *Inbreast: toward a full-field digital mammographic database*. Acad. Radiology, 19(2), 236–248.

The dataset from Semmelweis University is not publicly available, so I will note that it cannot be cited in the same way as the other two datasets.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
