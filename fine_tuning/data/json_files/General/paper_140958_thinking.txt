To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning with SASQuaTCh: a Novel Variational Quantum Transformer Architecture with Kernel-Based Self-Attention" by Ethan N. Evans et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to look deeper into the methodology to find specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (SASQuaTCh: A Quantum Fourier Vision Transformer Circuit)**, as this section likely contains details about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and descriptions.

In this paper, the authors mention using a **QPIXL embedding** for image data, which suggests that they may have utilized specific datasets for image classification tasks. However, I need to confirm this by checking if they explicitly name any datasets in the context of their experiments.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

If the paper does not explicitly mention datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that may provide additional information about the datasets used in their experiments.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
