To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Designing losses for data-free training of normalizing flows on Boltzmann distributions" by Loris Felardos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the generation of Boltzmann distributions and mentions using benchmarks related to molecular configurations, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe their approach and the context of their research. They mention using benchmarks for 3D molecular configurations, which indicates that specific datasets might be referenced later in the paper.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments using three datasets:

1. **Double Well 12D**: This dataset is a high-dimensional double-well potential used as a toy model for testing their methods. The authors describe it as having specific characteristics related to its dimensionality and structure.

2. **Butane Dataset**: This dataset consists of molecular configurations of butane, generated through Metropolis-Hastings simulations. The authors mention that the potential energy of the molecules is evaluated according to the CHARMM36m force field.

3. **Dialanine Dataset**: Similar to the butane dataset, this dataset contains molecular configurations of dialanine, also generated through Metropolis-Hastings simulations. The authors provide details about the energy evaluations and the characteristics of the dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Double Well 12D**, the dataset is referenced in the context of previous works but does not have a specific citation since it is a synthetic dataset created for the study.

- For the **Butane Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jing Huang, Sarah Rauscher, Grzegorz Nawrocki, Ting Ran, Michael Feig, Bert L de Groot, Helmut Grubmüller, and Alexander D MacKerell. *CHARMM36m: an improved force field for folded and intrinsically disordered proteins*. Nature Methods, 14(1):71–73, November 2016. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.4067.

- For the **Dialanine Dataset**, similar to the butane dataset, it is referenced in the context of the study but does not have a specific citation since it is also a synthetic dataset.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper.
