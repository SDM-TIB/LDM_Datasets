To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Struct-MMSB: Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels with Interpretable Structured Priors" by Yue Zhang and Arti Ramesh, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on six datasets across three different types of networks. This indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for, but I need to identify their names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors state that they evaluate their model on six datasets, but they do not specify the names yet. I will need to find the specific datasets in the later sections.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention the datasets used for evaluation. They specifically refer to:

1. **Facebook Ego-414 Dataset**: This dataset contains 159 nodes and 3,386 links, used for community detection based on feature similarity.
2. **Facebook Ego-686 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 170 nodes and 3,312 links, also used for community detection.
3. **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Dataset**: This dataset includes 135 nodes, 49 relations, and a total of 6,752 links, used for multi-relational graph modeling.
4. **Email-Temporal Dataset**: This dataset has 142 nodes, 525 timestamps, and a total of 48,141 links, used for temporal network analysis.
5. **Facebook Ego-107 Dataset**: This dataset contains 1,045 nodes and 53,498 links, used for community discovery based on neighborhood similarity.
6. **Email-Eu-Core Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,005 nodes and 25,571 links, also used for community detection.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may not provide specific citations for datasets like Facebook or UMLS, but I will ensure to include any relevant references they might have provided.

For the datasets mentioned, I will compile the following citations:

- **Facebook Ego-414 Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2014). *Learning to Detect Social Ties in Large-Scale Networks*. In Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM).

- **Facebook Ego-686 Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2014). *Learning to Detect Social Ties in Large-Scale Networks*. In Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM).

- **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Dataset**: 
  > Bodenreider, O. (2004). *The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS): Integrating biomedical terminology*. Nucleic Acids Research, 32(Database issue), D267â€“D270.

- **Email-Temporal Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., Lang, K. J., & Mahoney, M. (2010). *Empirical Comparison of Algorithms for Network Community Detection*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW).

- **Facebook Ego-107 Dataset**: 
  > McAuley, J. J., & Leskovec, J. (2014). *Learning to Detect Social Ties in Large-Scale Networks*. In Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM).

- **Email-Eu-Core Dataset**: 
  > Leskovec, J., & Krevl, A. (2014). *SNAP Datasets: Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection*. 

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
