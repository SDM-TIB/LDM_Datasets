To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Table Search Using a Deep Contextualized Language Model" by Zhiyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **public datasets**, which indicates that there are datasets relevant to their research. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors specifically mention using the **WikiTables dataset**, which is created by Zhang and Balog. They provide a brief description of the dataset, indicating that it consists of tables extracted from Wikipedia and includes context fields like page title and section title.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the WikiTables dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and can typically be found in the references where the dataset is first mentioned or discussed.

The citation for the WikiTables dataset is:
> Shuo Zhang and Krisztian Balog. *Ad hoc table retrieval using semantic similarity*. In Proceedings of the World Wide Web Conference (TheWebConf), pages 1553â€“1562, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **WikiTables Dataset**: This dataset is used for the experiments in the paper. It consists of tables extracted from Wikipedia, and the context fields include page title and section title.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
