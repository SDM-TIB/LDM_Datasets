To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beef up mmWave Dense Cellular Networks with D2D-Assisted Cooperative Edge Caching" by Wen Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables, figures, or text that explicitly mention datasets, their sizes, and their characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets related to mmWave communications, D2D communications, or edge caching. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, or specific metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets, I will look for any supplementary materials or appendices that might contain this information.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in this research paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
