To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Generalization in Meta-Learning via Meta-Gradient Augmentation" by Ren Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting extensive experiments on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will carefully read through the **experiments section** (Section V) to identify any datasets explicitly mentioned. In this section, the authors state that they conducted experiments with two widely-used datasets: **mini-ImageNet** and **CUB**. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used in the experiments.

In the **experiments subsection V-A**, the authors provide additional context about the datasets:
1. **mini-ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 100 classes of natural images sampled from ImageNet, with 600 images per class. It is split into non-overlapping 64, 16, and 20 classes for training, validation, and testing.
2. **CUB**: The CUB dataset contains 200 species of birds and a total of 11,788 images. The authors mention that they randomly select 100 classes as the training set, while the remaining classes are divided for validation and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
> Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., Kavukcuoglu, K., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In NIPS (pp. 3630â€“3638).

For **CUB**, the citation is:
> Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset. Technical Report CNS-TR-2011-001, California Institute of Technology.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are complete and correctly formatted.
