To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Can We Learn Communication-Efficient Optimizers?" by Charles-Ã‰tienne Joseph et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their learned optimizers on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention several datasets:

1. **Fashion MNIST (FMNIST)**: This dataset consists of 10 classes of clothing images, each image being 28x28 pixels. The authors state that they use this dataset for their experiments with a 2-Layer MLP architecture.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 10 classes of images, each image being 32x32 pixels. The authors also use this dataset for their experiments with a CNN architecture.

3. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, containing 1000 classes. The authors mention using downsampled versions of ImageNet (32x32 and 64x64 pixels) for their experiments.

4. **LM1B**: This dataset is used for language modeling tasks and is referenced as the "One Billion Word Benchmark." The authors indicate that they utilize this dataset in their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **Fashion MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **LM1B**, the citation is:
  > Ciprian Chelba, Tomas Mikolov, Mike Schuster, Qi Ge, Thorsten Brants, and Phillipp Koehn. *One Billion Word Benchmark for Measuring Progress in Statistical Language Modeling*. CoRR, abs/1312.3005, 2013.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
