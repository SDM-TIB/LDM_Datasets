To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Informative Causality Extraction from Medical Literature via Dependency-tree based Patterns" by M. Ahsanul Kabir et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a cause-effect dataset built from sentences from PubMed articles, which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **Materials and Methods section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SemEval Dataset**: This dataset is described as being built by combining the SemEval 2007 Task 4 dataset and the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset. It contains 7545 sentences in the training set, with 922 positive sentences, and is used for evaluating the performance of their method.

2. **MedCause Dataset**: This dataset was created by manual inspection of a large collection of PubMed articles. It contains 349 sentences, each with confirmed cause-effect phrases, and is noted for having a higher number of words in the cause-effect phrases compared to the SemEval dataset.

I will then check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **SemEval Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Girju, P. Nakov, V. Nastase, S. Szpakowicz, P. Turney, D. Yuret. *Semantic Relations: An Overview of the SemEval 2007 Task 4*. In Proceedings of the 2007 Joint Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and Computational Natural Language Learning (EMNLP-CoNLL), pages 13â€“18, 2007.

- For the **MedCause Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Ahsanul Kabir, AlJohara Almulhim, Xiao Luo, Mohammad Al Hasan. *MedCause: A Dataset for Cause-Effect Phrase Extraction in Medical Literature*. In Proceedings of the 2022 International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), pages 1-8, 2022.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references from the paper.
