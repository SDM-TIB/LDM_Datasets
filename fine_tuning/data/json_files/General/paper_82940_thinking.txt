To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TUNet: Incorporating segmentation maps to improve classification" by Yijun Tian, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a classification model for processing and classifying proteins in Atlas images, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the importance of protein localization and mentions the use of high-throughput fluorescence microscopy imaging. This indicates that the paper likely relies on a specific dataset for its experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 2)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used for the experiments. The paper states that the model and experiments are based on a dataset released by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC), which contains 31,072 samples from the Cell Atlas (Thul et al., 2017). This dataset is crucial for the research as it maps the localization of human proteins at a single-cell level to 28 subcellular structures.

The paper provides details about the dataset, including the types of images (original and scaled), their resolutions, and the labeling of protein localizations. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and its application in the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cell Atlas dataset mentioned. The relevant citation is:

- **Cell Atlas**: 
  > Thul, P. J., Åkesson, L., Wiking, M., Mahdessian, D., Geladaki, A., Ait Blal, H., Alm, T., Asplund, A., Björk, L., Breckels, L. M., Bäckström, A., Danielsson, F., Fagerberg, L., Fall, J., Gatto, L., Gnann, C., Hober, S., Hjelmare, M., Johansson, F., Lee, S., Lindskog, C., Mulder, J., Mulvey, C. M., Nilsson, P., Oksvold, P., Rockberg, J., Schutten, R., Schwenk, J. M., Sivertsson, Å., Sjöstedt, E., Skogs, M., Stadler, C., Sullivan, D. P., Tegel, H., Winsnes, C., Zhang, C., Zwahlen, M., Mardinoglu, A., Pontén, F., von Feilitzen, K., Lilley, K. S., Uhlén, M., and Lundberg, E. A subcellular map of the human proteome. *Science*, 356(6339):eaal3321, 2017. doi: 10.1126/science.aal3321. URL http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/05/10/science.aal3321.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extracted from the paper:

1. **Cell Atlas Dataset**: Contains 31,072 samples of high-resolution images used for protein localization in human cells, with labels indicating 28 different subcellular structures.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
