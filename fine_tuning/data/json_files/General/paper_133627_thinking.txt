To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Real-time Prediction of the Great Recession and the Covid-19 Recession" by Seulki Chung, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper uses "standard and penalized logistic regression models to predict the Great Recession and the Covid-19 recession in the US in real time," which suggests that there are datasets involved in this analysis.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Real-time data)**, where the author discusses the data used for the analysis. The author mentions using "194 real-time vintages in months, covering a range of macroeconomic and financial market variables from February 1967 to October 2021." This indicates a comprehensive dataset that spans several decades.

In this section, the author also specifies that the data includes "25 macroeconomic and financial variables from different categories such as output, income, prices, the labor market, the housing market, money and credit, and the financial market." This provides a clear indication of the types of data included but does not specify individual datasets yet.

I will also look for any tables that summarize the datasets or variables used. For example, **Table 1** provides an overview of the predictive variables, including their abbreviations, categories, transformations, and frequencies. This table is crucial for understanding the specific datasets utilized in the analysis.

Additionally, the author mentions retrieving most of the data from **ALFRED**, which is a well-known source for economic data. I will note this as it is important for citing the source of the datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or sources mentioned. The author refers to various studies and datasets throughout the paper, including those by Chauvet and Piger (2008) and Stark and Croushore (2002), which may provide additional context or datasets relevant to the analysis.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset mentioned. The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **Real-time vintages of macroeconomic and financial variables** (from ALFRED).
2. **NBER recession indicator** (constructed from ALFRED data).
3. **Predictive variables listed in Table 1**.

I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, including its source and any relevant details, and provide full citations for any referenced datasets or studies.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
