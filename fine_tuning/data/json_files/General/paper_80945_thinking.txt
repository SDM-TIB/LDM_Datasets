To extract datasets from the research paper titled "pROST: A Smoothed (cid:96)p-norm Robust Online Subspace Tracking Method for Realtime Background Subtraction in Video" by Florian Seidel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on a "state-of-the-art benchmark for background subtraction on real-world video data," which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors discuss the evaluation of their algorithm. In this section, they specifically mention using the **changedetection.net dataset** for their experiments. This is a clear indication that this dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any part of the paper where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this case, they describe the changedetection.net dataset, which provides image sequences and full ground truth for various categories, including static and dynamic backgrounds, thermal imaging, and camera jitter.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the changedetection.net dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Goyette, N., Jodoin, P., Porikli, F., Konrad, J., Ishwar, P. (2012). *Changedetection.net: A new change detection benchmark dataset*. In: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, pp. 1â€“8.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Changedetection.net Dataset**: This dataset consists of video sequences with ground truth for each frame, including information about background and foreground objects, their boundaries, and shadows. It is used to evaluate the performance of background subtraction algorithms.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included.
