To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GCRE-GPT: A Generative Model for Comparative Relation Extraction" by Yequan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **CameraReview**: This dataset is described as manually annotated and contains 1,279 comparative sentences and 1,780 relations. The authors note that it is the largest dataset of comparative sentences available.

2. **CompSent-08**: This dataset is constructed by Ganapathibhotla and Liu (2008) and includes both comparative and non-comparative sentences. The authors selected the comparative sentences for their experiments.

In this section, the authors also provide statistics about the datasets, including the train/dev/test splits, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CameraReview**, the citation is:
  > Kessler, W., & Kuhn, J. (2014). A corpus of comparisons in product reviews. In Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC 2014, Reykjavik, Iceland, May 26-31, 2014, pages 2242–2248. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For **CompSent-08**, the citation is:
  > Ganapathibhotla, M., & Liu, B. (2008). Mining opinions in comparative sentences. In COLING 2008, 22nd International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference, 18-22 August 2008, Manchester, UK, pages 241–248.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
