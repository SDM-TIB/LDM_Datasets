To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Medical Image Captioning via Generative Pretrained Transformers" by Alexander Selivanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on **two medical datasets, the Open-I and MIMIC-CXR**, as well as the general-purpose **MS-COCO** dataset. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **MIMIC-CXR**: This dataset is described as a large publicly available collection of chest radiographs in DICOM format, containing 377,110 images and corresponding free-text radiology reports. 

2. **Open-I**: The Indiana University Chest X-Ray Collection, which consists of 7,470 image-report pairs, with reports containing sections such as impression and findings.

3. **MSCOCO**: A large-scale non-medical dataset used for scene understanding, commonly employed for training and benchmarking object detection, segmentation, and captioning algorithms.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MIMIC-CXR**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, A. E. W., Pollard, T. J., Shen, L., Lehman, L. W., Feng, M., Ghassemi, M., ... & Mark, R. G. (2019). MIMIC-CXR, a de-identified publicly available database of chest radiographs with free-text reports. *Scientific Data*, 6, 1-8.

- For **Open-I**, the citation is:
  > Demner-Fushman, D., et al. (2016). Preparing a collection of radiology examinations for distribution and retrieval. *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, 23(2), 304-310. https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocv080.

- For **MSCOCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., et al. (2015). Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1405.0312*.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MIMIC-CXR**: A large dataset of chest radiographs with associated free-text reports, consisting of 377,110 images.
2. **Open-I**: A collection of 7,470 image-report pairs from chest X-rays, with detailed reports.
3. **MSCOCO**: A general-purpose dataset for scene understanding, widely used in various computer vision tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
