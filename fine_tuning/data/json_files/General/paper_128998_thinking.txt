To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "CST-YOLO: A Novel Method for Blood Cell Detection Based on Improved YOLOv7 and CNN-Swin Transformer" by Ming Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the CST-YOLO model was evaluated on three blood cell datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the three datasets used for evaluation: 

1. **Blood Cell Count and Detection (BCCD)**: This dataset contains 364 images with a resolution of 640x480 pixels. 

2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC)**: This dataset consists of 360 blood smear images, each resized to 640x480 resolution.

3. **Blood Cell Detection (BCD)**: This dataset includes 364 images with a resolution of 416x416 pixels.

The paper also notes that these datasets differ in quantity, resolution, and division, which is important for understanding their characteristics.

To ensure I have the correct citations for each dataset, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **BCCD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. Cheng, “BCCD (Blood Cell Count and Detection) dataset,” GitHub, 2019, https://github.com/Shenggan/BCCD-Dataset.

- For the **CBC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. M. Alam and M. T. Islam, “Machine learning approach of automatic identification and counting of blood cells,” Healthc. Technol. Lett., vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 103–108, Aug. 2019.

- For the **BCD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. Dongre, “Blood cell detection dataset,” Kaggle, 2021, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adhoppin/blood-cell-detection-dataset.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the datasets and their full citations from the research paper, which is crucial for proper referencing and validation in future work.
