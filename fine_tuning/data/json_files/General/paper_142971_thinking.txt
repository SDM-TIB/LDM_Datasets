To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Triadic-OCD: Asynchronous Online Change Detection with Provable Robustness, Optimality, and Convergence" by Yancheng Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but the introduction and experimental sections are more likely to contain specific details about datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of online change detection (OCD) and mention applications in smart grids and intrusion detection. However, they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experiments related to the detection of false data injection attacks (FDIA) in smart grids. They mention using measurement data generated from the **IEEE-14 bus power system**, which is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field.

The paper also provides details about the experimental setup, including the system matrix and the assumptions made regarding the data. However, it does not provide a separate section explicitly listing datasets, so I will need to extract the relevant information from the context.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEEE-14 bus power system dataset. The IEEE-14 bus system is commonly referenced in literature, and I can find its citation as follows:

- **IEEE-14 Bus Power System**:
  > "IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, 2014. IEEE 14-Bus Test Case." Available at: [IEEE PES](https://www.ieee-pes.org).

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset in a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
