To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Translation Testing via Syntactic Tree Pruning" by Quanjun Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on "two state-of-the-art machine translation systems" and refers to "1,200 source sentences as inputs." This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will examine the **experimental setup** section, particularly **section 4.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they mention that they collected real-world source sentences from various news articles, specifically from CNN, China Daily, BBC, and Reuters. They state that they extracted 1,200 sentences from ten categories, which include Business, Culture, Lifestyle, Sports, Politics, Travel, Technology, Health, Opinion, and Legal.

I will also look for any specific references to datasets in the **results** and **discussion** sections. The authors discuss the performance of their method on these datasets, but they do not provide additional datasets beyond the one mentioned.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: 1,200 Sentences from News Articles
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of 1,200 syntactically and semantically correct sentences collected from various news sources, categorized into ten different topics.
   - **Source**: CNN, China Daily, BBC, Reuters.
   - **Categories**: Business, Culture, Lifestyle, Sports, Politics, Travel, Technology, Health, Opinion, Legal.

Next, I will check the **References section** for any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is derived from publicly available news articles, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset as described in the paper. Since the dataset is based on articles from specific news outlets, I will note that the dataset is not formally cited but is based on publicly accessible content from these sources.

In conclusion, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, source, and categories, while also noting the lack of a formal citation for the dataset.
