To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jointly Encoding Word Confusion Network and Dialogue Context with BERT for Spoken Language Understanding" by Chen Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on **DSTC2**, which indicates that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **experiments section**. In section 3, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on the **DSTC2 dataset**, which contains 11,677 training utterances, 3,934 validation utterances, and 9,890 test utterances. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and its purpose in the context of the research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DSTC2 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **DSTC2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Henderson, B. Thomson, and J. D. Williams. *The second dialog state tracking challenge*. In Proceedings of the 15th annual meeting of the special interest group on discourse and dialogue (SIGDIAL), pages 263â€“272, 2014.

Since DSTC2 is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete with the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
