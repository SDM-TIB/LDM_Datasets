To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Network–Based Automatic Classification of Colorectal and Prostate Tumor Biopsies Using Multispectral Imagery: System Development Study" by Remy Peyret et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and results, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically the **Data Set Description** subsection, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors describe two datasets:

1. **Prostate Data Set**: This dataset consists of 512 multispectral prostate tumor tissue images, each sized 128×128 pixels. The images were taken at 16 spectral channels (500-650 nm) and evaluated by pathologists, categorized into four classes: stroma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic carcinoma.

2. **Colorectal Data Set**: This dataset includes multispectral colorectal histology images, also with a 40× magnification power. It comprises four classes, each containing 40 images, acquired across a wider spectrum than the prostate dataset, covering both visible and infrared ranges.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are likely original to the authors' research, they may not have separate citations. Instead, I will note the authors' descriptions and the context in which the datasets were used.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to attribute the datasets correctly.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Peyret R, alSaeed D, Khelifi F, Al-Ghreimil N, Al-Baity H, Bouridane A. *Convolutional Neural Network–Based Automatic Classification of Colorectal and Prostate Tumor Biopsies Using Multispectral Imagery: System Development Study*. JMIR Bioinform Biotech 2022;3(1):e27394. doi: 10.2196/27394.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
