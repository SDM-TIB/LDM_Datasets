To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Forecasting of Large Scale Hierarchical Time Series via Multilevel Clustering" by Xing Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the proposed method and its applications but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction may provide insights into the datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic data and a real-world dataset from a large corporation, specifically focusing on hierarchical time series data. They describe the synthetic dataset generated using ARMA simulations, but I need to find the exact names and details of the real-world datasets.

In Section 4.1, the authors state that they used a dataset containing **12,000 users' electronic records of expenses in different categories**. This dataset is crucial for understanding the application of their method. They also mention another dataset, the **M5 Competition dataset**, which involves unit sales of various products across multiple stores.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **M5 Competition dataset**, the citation is:
   > Makridakis, S., Spiliotis, E., & Assimakopoulos, V. (2020). The M5 accuracy competition: Results, findings and conclusions. *International Journal of Forecasting*, 36(1), 1-10.

2. For the **Wikipedia Page View dataset**, the citation is:
   > Wikipedia Page View. (2015-2016). Daily views of various Wikipedia articles. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting.

3. For the **financial dataset**, while the authors mention it is collected by a large financial software company, they do not provide a specific citation due to privacy concerns. However, I can note that it is a proprietary dataset used for forecasting financial insights.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
