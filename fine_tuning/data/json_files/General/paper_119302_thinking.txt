To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Directional Subspace Editing in Style-Space" by Chen Naveh and Yacov Hel-Or, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for evaluation or comparison. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that the authors may have used to validate their method. If they mention any datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down. However, the introduction primarily discusses the methodology and does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets or data sources. 

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using a dataset of **2,000 vector pairs** generated from a Gaussian distribution, but they do not provide a specific dataset name. They also reference pre-trained classifiers for attributes, which are based on the **FFHQ dataset** for facial attributes and the **Yahoo YFCC100M dataset** for race classification. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. **FFHQ Dataset**:
   > Karras, T., Laine, S., & Aila, T. (2019). A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4401–4410.

2. **Yahoo YFCC100M Dataset**:
   > Thomee, B., Shamma, D. A., Friedland, G., Elizalde, B., Ni, K., Poland, D., Borth, D., & Li, L.-J. (2016). YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research. Communications of the ACM, 59(2), 64–73.

With these citations, I have successfully identified and documented the datasets used in the research paper. I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
