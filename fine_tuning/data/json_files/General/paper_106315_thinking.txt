To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Latent Transformations via NeuralODEs for GAN-based Image Editing" by Valentin Khrulkov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors investigate a large number of datasets with known attributes, which suggests that multiple datasets will be discussed throughout the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly list the datasets, which is crucial for my extraction process.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **MPI3D**: This dataset consists of 1,036,800 images with 7 factors of variation, representing a robotic arm in various positions holding objects of varied shapes and colors. The authors specify that they use the toy part of the dataset, which contains simply rendered images.

2. **Isaac3D**: This dataset contains 737,280 high-resolution images with 9 factors of variation. The authors note that it is an advanced version of MPI3D with photorealistic images and more attributes.

3. **FFHQ**: This dataset consists of 70,000 high-quality human face images and is a standard benchmark for image editing due to its rich variation in age, ethnicity, lighting, and background.

4. **Places365**: This dataset contains 1,803,460 training images with over 400 unique scene categories. The authors restrict their dataset to outdoor natural scenes, resulting in 239,457 images.

5. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset consists of 11,788 images of birds with given attribute information covering 312 binary factors of variation, focusing on visual features such as color, patterns, and shapes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **MPI3D**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
