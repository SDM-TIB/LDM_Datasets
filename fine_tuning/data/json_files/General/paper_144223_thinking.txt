To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Out-of-distribution Reject Option Method for Dataset Shift Problem in Early Disease Onset Prediction" by Taisei Tosaki et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets used in the study. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their method using two datasets: **Hirosaki health checkup data** and **Wakayama health checkup data**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Methods** or **Datasets** section, which typically provides detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this paper, the **Methods** section discusses the health checkup data from Hirosaki City and Wakayama Prefecture, emphasizing their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

I will note the following details about each dataset:

1. **Hirosaki Health Checkup Data**: This dataset is derived from the Iwaki Health Promotion Study, encompassing over 2000 items, including physiological, biochemical, and lifestyle data collected from health checkups conducted between 2005 and 2020.

2. **Wakayama Health Checkup Data**: Similar to the Hirosaki dataset, this dataset includes comprehensive health checkup data collected from Wakayama Prefecture between 2018 and 2019, also containing various health-related metrics.

Next, I will check the **References** section to find full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are derived from specific health studies rather than published datasets with formal citations, I will summarize their origins based on the information provided in the paper.

The citations for the datasets will be as follows:

- **Hirosaki Health Checkup Data**: 
  > Nakaji, S. et al. *Social innovation for life expectancy extension utilizing a platform-centered system used in the Iwaki health promotion project: A protocol paper*. SAGE Open Medicine, 9, 20503121211002606, 2021.

- **Wakayama Health Checkup Data**: 
  > Zhang, Y. et al. *Muscle mass reduction, low muscle strength, and their combination are associated with arterial stiffness in community-dwelling elderly population: the Wakayama Study*. J Hum Hypertens, 35, 446â€“454, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
