To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample-efficient Surrogate Model for Frequency Response of Linear PDEs using Self-Attentive Complex Polynomials" by Andrew Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a surrogate model for predicting scattering coefficients in antenna design, which suggests that there may be datasets related to antenna designs or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific mentions of datasets used for training or testing the model. In this section, the authors mention using **48K total samples**, which were uniformly sampled and simulated with CST Microwave Studio. This indicates that the dataset consists of simulation data related to antenna designs.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any datasets are referenced that are commonly used in the field of electromagnetic modeling or antenna design. However, the primary dataset appears to be the one generated from CST Microwave Studio.

Now, I will look for any **appendices or references** that might provide additional details about the dataset or its source. The references include citations for CST Studio Suite, which is the software used for simulation, but there are no specific datasets cited beyond the mention of the 48K samples.

Since the paper does not provide a formal dataset citation like some other papers might, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **CST Microwave Studio Dataset**: This dataset consists of 48,000 samples generated from simulations using CST Microwave Studio, which is a commercial software for electromagnetic simulation. The dataset is used to train and test the proposed surrogate model for predicting the frequency response of antennas.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant citations for the software used to generate the dataset.

The full citation for the software is:
> CST Studio Suite, 2021. URL: https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/.

With this information, I can now create an entry for the dataset that reflects its source and purpose in the context of the research paper.
