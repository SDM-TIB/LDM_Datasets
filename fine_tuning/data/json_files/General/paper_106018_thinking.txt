To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CVSS-BERT: Explainable Natural Language Processing to Determine the Severity of a Computer Security Vulnerability from its Description" by Mustafizur R. Shahid and HervÃ© Debar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) system and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). They mention that the NVD database is used for their experiments, which indicates that it is a key dataset.

Next, I will check the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their data collection process. They state that their dataset consists of 3 years of CVE vulnerability data from 2018 to 2020, totaling 45,926 samples. This is a significant dataset that I need to document.

The authors also mention that the NVD database is synchronized with the MITRE CVE list, which further emphasizes the importance of this dataset in their research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**:
   > National Vulnerability Database (NVD), (accessed July 27, 2021). [Online]. Available: https://nvd.nist.gov/

2. For the **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)**:
   > Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), (accessed July 27, 2021). [Online]. Available: https://cve.mitre.org/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
