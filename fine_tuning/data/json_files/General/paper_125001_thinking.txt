To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Two Steps Forward and One Behind: Rethinking Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning" by Riccardo Ughi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but the details are likely to be found in the experiments section.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments Setting)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, they summarize the datasets in a table and describe their characteristics, which is crucial for understanding how they were utilized in the study.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **ETTh1**: This dataset consists of 17,520 hourly samples related to electricity consumption, collected over two years from a station in China.

2. **ETTm1**: Similar to ETTh1, this dataset contains 70,080 samples taken at 15-minute intervals from the same station, also related to electricity consumption.

3. **Electricity**: This dataset includes 26,304 hourly samples from 321 customers, covering electricity consumption data from 2012 to 2014.

4. **Temperature of Milan (Milan T°)**: This dataset contains daily mean temperature data from Milan, spanning from 2001 to 2021, with a total of 7,360 samples.

5. **High Water of Venice (Venice)**: This dataset records sea level values in Venice, consisting of 330,000 hourly samples collected from 1983 to the present.

6. **Weather**: This dataset includes 21 meteorological features collected in Germany in 2020, with a total of 52,696 samples taken at 10-minute intervals.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
