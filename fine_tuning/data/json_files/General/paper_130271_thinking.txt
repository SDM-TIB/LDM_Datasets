To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparing normalizing flows and diffusion models for prosody and acoustic modelling in text-to-speech" by Guangyan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental protocol sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction may reference datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental protocol section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention using an **internal dataset of 200 speech hours**, recorded by 116 native speakers of English. This dataset is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited that may have been used in their comparisons or methodologies. However, it appears that the authors primarily rely on their internal dataset for the experiments.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset:

1. **Internal Dataset**: This dataset consists of 200 hours of speech recorded by 116 native English speakers across various expressive speaking styles. The dataset is used for training the models and evaluating their performance.

Since the paper does not provide a formal citation for the internal dataset, I will note that it is an internal dataset and does not have a publicly available citation. 

Next, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format the dataset information according to the required structure.

In conclusion, I will create an entry for the internal dataset, noting its characteristics and the context in which it was used, while acknowledging the lack of a formal citation. This will ensure that the dataset information is clear and comprehensive for future reference or analysis.
