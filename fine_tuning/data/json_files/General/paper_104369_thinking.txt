To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Paradigm for Information Extraction from Transcripts Using BERT" by Aravind Chandramouli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of BERT for extracting key topics and intents from audio call transcripts, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The authors describe the challenges of extracting metadata from voice transcripts but do not specify any datasets at this point. I will continue to the **methodology section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of their experiments or evaluations.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their system, TINCE, and its components, but again, there is no mention of specific datasets. I will check the **results section** to see if they refer to any datasets used for evaluation metrics. 

Upon reviewing the **results section**, I find that the authors mention evaluating their methods against a "golden set" of manually tagged data, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation. This suggests that the authors may have used proprietary or internal datasets that are not publicly available.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the references primarily consist of related works and do not include specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

In summary, I will note that while the paper discusses methodologies and evaluations, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for datasets used in their research. Therefore, I will not create any dataset entries as there are none to report.
