To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reviving Shift Equivariance in Vision Transformers" by Peijian Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, while the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. In this case, the authors discuss the importance of shift equivariance in vision transformers, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In Section 4.1, the authors mention using **ImageNet-1k** for their experiments, which is a well-known dataset in the field of computer vision. They describe it as containing 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. This is a clear indication that I have found a dataset.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet-1k dataset. The citation for ImageNet is typically attributed to the original paper that introduced it, which is:

> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will conclude my extraction process here.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ImageNet-1k dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the research.
