To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Autoencoders Pursue PCA Directions (by Accident)" by Michal Rolínek et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets in their experiments, specifically in the **Results section**. I will pay close attention to any descriptions or references to datasets that are used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors explicitly mention the following datasets:

1. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a well-known dataset for evaluating disentanglement in generative models. It consists of 2D shapes that vary in scale, rotation, and position.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: A classic dataset used for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits.

3. **FashionMNIST Dataset**: This dataset serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, containing 70,000 images of clothing items.

4. **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- For **dSprites Dataset**:
  > Loic Matthey, Irina Higgins, Demis Hassabis, and Alexander Lerchner. *dsprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/, 2017.

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, November 1998.

- For **FashionMNIST Dataset**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. ArXiv e-prints, abs/1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
