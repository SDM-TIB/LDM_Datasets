To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Fully Automated Segmentation of Rat Cardiac MRI by Leveraging Deep Learning Frameworks" by Daniel Fern√°ndez-Llaneza et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 1.1 (Data Acquisition)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention six segmentation datasets consisting of short-axis 3D CMR images from sham-operated rats or rats with induced myocardial infarcts. This section is likely to contain the most detailed information about the datasets.

In this section, I will note the following datasets:

1. **Study 1**: 126 image stacks, 3 timepoints.
2. **Study 2**: 73 image stacks, 2 timepoints.
3. **Study 3**: 43 image stacks, 3 timepoints.
4. **Study 4**: 92 image stacks, 2 timepoints.
5. **Study 5**: 116 image stacks, 3 timepoints.
6. **Study 6**: 94 image stacks, 3 timepoints.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or validation regarding the datasets used, particularly in terms of their performance metrics or comparisons.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the datasets appear to be original to the study and may not have external citations. If any datasets are derived from previously published works, I will ensure to include those citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names, descriptions, and any relevant details, ensuring to format the citations correctly for each dataset. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
