To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wider or Deeper: Revisiting the ResNet Model for Visual Recognition" by Zifeng Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper. The introduction will provide context on the datasets used and their significance in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental results** section. In this paper, the authors discuss their results on various datasets, including **ImageNet**, **PASCAL VOC**, **Cityscapes**, and **ADE20K**. I will note down the specific datasets mentioned and any details provided about them, such as the number of images, categories, and any augmentation techniques used.

In the **experimental results** section, the authors provide detailed comparisons of their models on these datasets. I will extract the relevant information about each dataset, including the number of images for training and validation, the categories involved, and any specific methodologies applied during the experiments.

After gathering the dataset names and descriptions, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

The citations I will look for include:

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. Int. J. Comput. Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

2. **PASCAL VOC**: The citation for the PASCAL VOC dataset is:
   > M. Everingham, S. Eslami, L. van Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL visual object classes challenge: A retrospective*. Int. J. Comput. Vision, 2014.

3. **Cityscapes**: The citation for the Cityscapes dataset is:
   > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proc. IEEE Conf. Comp. Vis. Patt. Recogn., 2016.

4. **ADE20K**: The citation for the ADE20K dataset is:
   > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Semantic understanding of scenes through ADE20K dataset*. arXiv:1608.05442, 2016.

Once I have compiled all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will organize this data clearly to facilitate further processing or review. This structured approach ensures that I do not miss any critical details and that I provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
