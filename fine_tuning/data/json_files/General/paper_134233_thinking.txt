To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PRCA: Fitting Black-Box Large Language Models for Retrieval Question Answering via Pluggable Reward-Driven Contextual Adapter" by Haoyan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments validate the effectiveness of PRCA on three datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **SQuAD**: This dataset is described as having 87.6k training questions and 10.6k testing questions, with a one-to-one matching of questions, documents, and answers.

2. **HotpotQA**: This dataset consists of 90.4k training questions and 7.4k testing questions, requiring multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents.

3. **TopiOCQA**: This dataset includes 45.5k training questions and 2.5k testing questions, focusing on conversational question answering with topic switching.

In this section, the authors provide a brief overview of the characteristics of each dataset, which is crucial for understanding their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2383–2392). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **HotpotQA**, the citation is:
  > Yang, Z., Wang, H., Yih, W. T., He, X., & Gao, J. (2018). HotpotQA: A dataset for diverse, explainable multi-hop question answering. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (pp. 2369–2380). Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **TopiOCQA**, the citation is:
  > Adlakha, V., Dhuliawala, S., Suleman, K., de Vries, H., & Reddy, S. (2022). TopiOCQA: Open-domain conversational question answering with topic switching. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 10, 468–483.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
