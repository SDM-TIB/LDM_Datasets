To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Janus Interface: How Fine-Tuning in Large Language Models Amplifies the Privacy Risks" by Xiaoyi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of "three privacy datasets (i.e., Enron, ECHR, and Ai4Privacy)" which indicates that these datasets are crucial to the research. This gives me a clear starting point for my extraction process.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the paper, the authors describe their experiments and explicitly list the datasets used:

1. **Enron Dataset**: This dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails from employees of the Enron Corporation, which was made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

2. **ECHR Dataset**: This dataset consists of around 11.5K legal judgment cases from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

3. **Ai4Privacy Dataset**: This dataset includes over 300k examples covering 6 languages and 27 PII types in 749 discussion subjects, containing highly sensitive privacy data.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **Enron Dataset**:
  > 2015. Enron Email Dataset. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/.

- For the **ECHR Dataset**:
  > Ilias Chalkidis, Ion Androutsopoulos, and Nikolaos Aletras. 2019. Neural legal judgment prediction in English. arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.02059 (2019).

- For the **Ai4Privacy Dataset**:
  > 2024. Ai4Privacy. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai4privacy/pii-masking-300k.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extraction is thorough and properly documented for future reference or analysis.
