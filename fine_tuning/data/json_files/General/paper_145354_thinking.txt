To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception" by M. Mahbubur Rahman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that the MMVR dataset consists of 345K multi-view radar frames collected from 25 human subjects, which indicates that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for additional context about the dataset. The introduction discusses the scarcity of indoor radar datasets and emphasizes the significance of the MMVR dataset in advancing indoor radar perception. It mentions that the dataset supports three major perception tasks: object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation.

I will then look into the **Datasets** section, specifically **Table 1**, which compares various indoor radar perception datasets. This table lists several datasets, including:

1. **RadHAR** (Singh et al. (2019)): A dataset consisting of point clouds using mmWave radar for human activity recognition.
2. **mm-Pose** (Sengupta et al. (2020)): A dataset for human skeletal posture estimation using mmWave radar.
3. **MMVR** (Rahman et al. (2023)): The dataset being introduced in this paper, which is the focus of my extraction.

In the **conclusion** section, the authors reiterate the contributions of the MMVR dataset and its potential applications, which further solidifies its importance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For **RadHAR**, the citation is:
  > Akash Deep Singh, Sandeep Singh Sandha, Luis Garcia, and Mani Srivastava. *RadHAR: Human activity recognition from point clouds generated through a millimeter-wave radar*. In ACM Workshop on Millimeter-Wave Networks and Sensing Systems, pp. 51–56, 2019.

- For **mm-Pose**, the citation is:
  > Arindam Sengupta, Feng Jin, Renyuan Zhang, and Siyang Cao. *mm-Pose: Real-time human skeletal posture estimation using mmWave radars and CNNs*. IEEE Sensors Journal, 20(17):10032–10044, 2020.

- For **MMVR**, the citation is:
  > M. Mahbubur Rahman, Ryoma Yataka, Sorachi Kato, Pu (Perry) Wang, Peizhao Li, Adriano Cardace, and Petros Boufounos. *MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception*. Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for downstream processing or review.
