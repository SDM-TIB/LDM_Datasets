To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Identity Matters in Deep Learning" by Moritz Hardt and Tengyu Ma, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using **CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as the number of classes and the nature of the data.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

2. **CIFAR100 Dataset**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211–252, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
