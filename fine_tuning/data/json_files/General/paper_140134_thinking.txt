To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PixArt-Σ: Weak-to-Strong Training of Diffusion Transformer for 4K Text-to-Image Generation" by Junsong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of "high-quality training data" and "a curated set comprising 30,000 high-quality, aesthetically pleasing text-image pairs," indicating that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Data Analysis)**, where the authors discuss their dataset in detail. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **Internal-Σ Dataset**: This dataset consists of 33 million high-resolution images sourced from the internet, all exceeding 1K resolution. It includes 2.3 million images with resolutions around 4K and is characterized by high aesthetic quality and diverse artistic styles.

2. **High-Quality Evaluation Dataset**: This dataset comprises 30,000 high-quality text-image pairs curated to assess the model's performance in aesthetics and text-image alignment. The authors emphasize that this dataset is designed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation than the commonly used MSCOCO dataset.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations related to these datasets. However, since the datasets are primarily internal and specific to the authors' research, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details as outlined in the paper.

After gathering all necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the essence of each dataset as described by the authors.
