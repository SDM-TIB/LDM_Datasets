To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximation Schemes for ReLU Regression" by Ilias Diakonikolas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is often where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. If the paper includes a section specifically labeled "Datasets" or "Experiments," I will focus on that section to gather detailed information about each dataset.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for training or testing their algorithms, I will note that down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors mention using a dataset like "MNIST" or "CIFAR-10," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to include the full citation for each dataset, as this is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
