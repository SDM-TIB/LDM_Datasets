To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assisting Decision Making in Scholarly Peer Review: A Preference Learning Perspective" by Nils Dycke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on peer review data from the **ACL 2018 conference**, which suggests that this dataset is significant for the study.

Next, I will examine **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. They specifically mention the **ACL-2018 dataset**, which includes reviews and acceptance labels for 1,538 submissions from 21 tracks. This section provides detailed statistics about the dataset, confirming its relevance to the research.

In the same section, the authors provide a summary of the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of papers, reviews, and the average number of reviews per paper. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ACL-2018 dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:
> Gao, Yang, Steffen Eger, Ilia Kuznetsov, Iryna Gurevych, and Yusuke Miyao. "Does My Rebuttal Matter? Insights from a Major NLP Conference." In Proceedings of NAACL 2019: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1, pages 1274â€“1290, June 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will focus solely on the ACL-2018 dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
