To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feedbackward Decoding for Semantic Segmentation" by Beinan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **Cityscapes semantic segmentation benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors specifically mention using the **Cityscapes dataset** for their experiments in section 4 (Experiments). They describe it as a benchmark for semantic segmentation, which confirms its relevance.

Now, I will gather the necessary details about the **Cityscapes dataset**. The authors reference it multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of their evaluation metrics and results. This reinforces its significance in their research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Cityscapes dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- **Cityscapes Dataset**:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. CoRR, abs/1604.01685, 2016. URL http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01685.

Since the paper primarily discusses the Cityscapes dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

After completing these steps, I will have successfully extracted the dataset information from the paper, ready for further processing or review.
