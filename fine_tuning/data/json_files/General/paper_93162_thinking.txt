To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Greenhouse Segmentation on High-Resolution Optical Satellite Imagery Using Deep Learning Techniques" by Orkhan Baghirli et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and mentions the use of **pan-sharpened orthorectified Azersky images** for greenhouse segmentation, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors elaborate on the dataset used. They specify that the dataset consists of images collected from **15 regions in Azerbaijan**, covering an area of **1008 km²** with **47559 polygons** in the annotation masks. This gives me a clear understanding of the dataset's scope and characteristics.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe the dataset in more detail, including the resolution of **1.5 meters** and the channels used (red, green, blue, and near-infrared). They also mention the preprocessing steps and the challenges faced, which further confirms the dataset's significance in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors refer to the dataset again, particularly in the context of performance evaluation metrics. They mention using the dataset for training and validation, which reinforces its importance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is derived from the Azersky (SPOT-7) satellite imagery. However, I can reference the satellite source as follows:

- **Azersky (SPOT-7) Satellite Imagery**: 
  > Azercosmos OJSC. *Azersky Satellite Imagery*. Available at: [https://www.azercosmos.az](https://www.azercosmos.az) (Accessed: [Date]).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Azersky (SPOT-7) Satellite Imagery
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of pan-sharpened orthorectified images with a resolution of 1.5 meters, covering 15 regions in Azerbaijan with a total area of 1008 km². It includes annotation masks containing 47559 polygons for greenhouse segmentation.
   - **Citation**: Azercosmos OJSC. *Azersky Satellite Imagery*. Available at: [https://www.azercosmos.az](https://www.azercosmos.az) (Accessed: [Date]).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
