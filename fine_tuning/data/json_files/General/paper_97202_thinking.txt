To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter with Machine Learning Methods" by Ana B. Ruescas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on machine learning methods for retrieving CDOM, but it does not explicitly mention datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of CDOM measurements and mentions the use of a dataset from the Case2eXtreme (C2X) project, which is a good lead.

In the **methods section**, specifically in subsection 2.1, the authors mention using a "Hydrolight simulation dataset" from the C2X project. This dataset is crucial for their analysis, and I will need to gather more details about it.

I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as its characteristics, size, and the context in which it was used. The authors describe the dataset as containing simulated hyperspectral Rrs data that includes extreme absorbing waters, which is essential information for understanding its application.

In the **results section**, the authors do not introduce any new datasets but refer back to the C2X dataset for their experiments. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their study.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the C2X dataset. The paper mentions the C2X project, and I will need to locate the original source or documentation for this dataset to provide a complete citation.

The citation for the C2X project is:
> Hieromyni, M., Krasemann, H., Mueller, D., Brockmann, C., Ruescas, A., Stelzer, K., Nechad, B., Ruddick, K., Simis, S., Tisltone, G., Steinmetz, F., & Regner, P. (2016). *Ocean colour remote sensing of extreme case-2 waters*. Living Planet Symposium.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the C2X dataset, ensuring to include all relevant details and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format, ready for further processing or review.
