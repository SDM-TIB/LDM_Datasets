To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On Convergence of Incremental Gradient for Non-Convex Smooth Functions" by Anastasia Koloskova et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and experiments sections, as they often contain references to datasets used in the study.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any mentions of datasets used for experiments or theoretical analysis. If the authors reference specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail. This section typically describes the methodology and datasets used for validation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I will look for its full citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset's details, including any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper, such as the number of samples, features, or any unique attributes that are relevant to the research findings.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets from the paper effectively, ensuring that I include full citations for each dataset as required.
