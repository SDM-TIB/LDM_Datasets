To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interactive-KBQA: Multi-Turn Interactions for Knowledge Base Question Answering with Large Language Models" by Guanming Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors state that their method achieves competitive results on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Dataset & Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide a list of datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **WebQuestionsSP (WebQSP)**: This dataset is used for evaluating knowledge base question answering and consists of natural language questions along with their corresponding SPARQL queries. 

2. **ComplexWebQuestions (CWQ)**: This dataset extends WebQSP and includes various types of complex questions, making it suitable for testing the robustness of KBQA systems.

3. **KQA Pro**: A large-scale dataset designed for complex question answering over a dense set of Wikidata, featuring multiple types of complex questions.

4. **MetaQA**: This dataset is built upon a Movie Knowledge Base and includes question-answer pairs that require multi-hop reasoning.

In the same section, the authors provide statistics for each dataset, including the number of annotated examples for training and testing, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **WebQuestionsSP**, the citation is:

- For **ComplexWebQuestions**, the citation is:

- For **KQA Pro**, the citation is:

In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 6101–6119.

- For **MetaQA**, the citation is:

AAAI Press.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
