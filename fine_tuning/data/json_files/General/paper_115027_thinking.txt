To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robust Tests in Online Decision-Making" by Gi-Soo Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of bandit algorithms in mobile health, which may imply the use of specific datasets related to health interventions.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on synthetic data and real data, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are referenced. The authors mention using the **Recovery Record Dataset**, which contains patients' adherence behaviors to therapy for eating disorders. This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Recovery Record Dataset**. If the dataset is not directly cited, I will look for any papers or sources that describe the dataset in detail.

The citation for the **Recovery Record Dataset** is not explicitly provided in the references, so I will note that it is a dataset used in the context of the paper but may require further investigation to find its original source or documentation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Recovery Record Dataset**: This dataset is used to analyze patients' adherence behaviors to therapy for eating disorders. It includes data on daily meal monitoring and clinician interactions.

Since the paper does not provide a full citation for the Recovery Record Dataset, I will note that it is essential to find the original source or documentation for this dataset for proper citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I highlight the importance of including full citations for datasets in research papers.
