To extract datasets from the research paper titled "To Grok or Not to Grok: Disentangling Generalization and Memorization on Corrupted Algorithmic Datasets" by Darshil Doshi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of generalization in deep learning and mentions the use of modular arithmetic tasks, which suggests that there may be specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors refer to "modular arithmetic tasks" and describe the nature of the data used, but I need to find specific dataset names and details.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their experimental setup, including the use of a "modular addition dataset." They mention that the dataset consists of pairs of examples generated for the modular addition task, but they do not provide a formal citation or reference to an existing dataset.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any references to existing datasets used in their experiments. However, it appears that the dataset is generated specifically for their study rather than being sourced from an established dataset repository.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for any external datasets, I will note that the modular addition dataset is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research. The authors do not cite any external datasets, which means I will not have traditional citations to provide.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:

1. **Modular Addition Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created for the modular addition task, consisting of pairs of examples where the network learns to compute \( z = (m + n) \mod p \). The dataset is generated based on the parameters defined in the paper, specifically for the experiments conducted.

Since there are no external citations for this dataset, I will note that it is a custom dataset created by the authors for their specific research purposes.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
