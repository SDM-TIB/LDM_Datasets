To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Active RIS Versus Passive RIS: Which Is Superior with the Same Power Budget?" by Kangda Zhi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on comparing active and passive RIS systems, but it does not mention specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets used in previous studies or experiments. The introduction discusses the theoretical aspects of RIS systems but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then look into the **system model and simulation results sections**. These sections often contain details about the experimental setup and any datasets used for simulations. In this case, the authors mention that they consider a simulation setup similar to those in previous works, specifically citing references [7] and [8]. 

In the **simulation results section**, the authors state that they use the same simulation setup as in [7] and [8]. Therefore, I will need to check these references to identify the datasets they utilized.

Upon reviewing the references:
- Reference [7] is:
  > Z. Zhang, L. Dai, X. Chen, C. Liu, F. Yang, R. Schober, and H. V. Poor. "Active RIS vs. passive RIS: Which will prevail in 6G?" 2021. [Online]. Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15154

- Reference [8] is:
  > R. Long, Y.-C. Liang, Y. Pei, and E. G. Larsson. "Active reconﬁgurable intelligent surface aided wireless communications," IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol. 20, no. 8, pp. 4962–4975, Aug. 2021.

Next, I will check these references for any datasets they mention. 

In reference [8], the authors describe their simulation setup, which includes parameters for the RIS and channel models but do not specify a publicly available dataset. Instead, they focus on theoretical models and simulations.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for empirical analysis or simulations, I conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

Finally, I will summarize my findings, noting that while the paper discusses theoretical comparisons and simulations, it does not provide specific datasets or references to datasets that can be cited.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were identified in this paper, and therefore, no citations are necessary.
