To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Low-Rank Matrix Estimation without the Condition Number" by Mohammadreza Soltani and Chinmay Hegde, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on experiments or datasets**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often titled "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically includes details about the datasets, such as their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will pay special attention to any mentions of datasets in the **applications section** as well, since the authors may describe how their proposed method is applied to specific datasets in practical scenarios.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called "Synthetic Data for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation," I will look for the citation that provides the source of this dataset. If the dataset is publicly available, I will note that as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset, including the citation format used in the paper, to ensure proper credit is given to the original sources.
