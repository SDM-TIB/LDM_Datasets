To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equalizing Gender Bias in Neural Machine Translation with Word Embeddings Techniques" by Joel Escudé Font and Marta R. Costa-jussà, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental framework sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their system on the **WMT English-Spanish benchmark task**, which suggests that there are datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the presence of gender bias in machine translation and mention their objective to study this bias. However, I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Framework)**, where the authors describe the corpora used for their experiments. They mention that the training set consists of **16,554,790 sentences** from various sources, including:

1. **United Nations Corpus**: This dataset is referenced as being from Ziemski et al. (2016).
2. **Europarl**: Cited from Koehn (2005).
3. **CommonCrawl**: A well-known dataset for multilingual text.
4. **WMT newstest2012 and newstest2013**: These are specified as the validation and test sets, respectively.

Additionally, the authors created a custom test set called the **Occupations test**, which is designed to evaluate gender bias in translations. This test set is based on a sentence pattern involving various occupations and is derived from a list from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as referenced in the paper.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

- For the **United Nations Corpus**:
  > Ziemski, M., Junczys-Dowmunt, M., & Pouliquen, B. (2016). The United Nations Parallel Corpus v1.0. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016), Paris, France. European Language Resources Association (ELRA).

- For the **Europarl**:
  > Koehn, P. (2005). Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation. In Conference Proceedings: the Tenth Machine Translation Summit, pages 79–86, Phuket, Thailand. AAMT.

- For the **WMT newstest datasets**:
  > The WMT datasets are typically referenced in the context of the annual Workshop on Machine Translation, but specific citations may vary by year. The authors do not provide a specific citation in the text, so I will note that they are part of the WMT workshop resources.

- For the **Occupations test set**, the authors reference the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, but do not provide a specific citation in the paper. I will note that it is based on publicly available data from the Bureau.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
