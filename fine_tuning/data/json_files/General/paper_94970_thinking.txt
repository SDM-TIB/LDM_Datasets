To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Guided BERT for Targeted Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis" by Zhengxuan Wu and Desmond C. Ong, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two datasets for their experiments: **SentiHood** and **SemEval-2014 (Task 4)**. This is a strong indication that these datasets will be detailed further in the paper.

Next, I will look specifically in **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a description of the datasets used. Here, they mention:

1. **SentiHood Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5,215 sentences, with a focus on urban neighborhoods and sentiment analysis related to various aspects such as price and safety.

2. **SemEval-2014 Task 4 Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,044 sentences from restaurant reviews, used for aspect-based sentiment classification.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for their models, which further validates their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SentiHood Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Saeidi, M., Bouchard, G., Liakata, M., & Riedel, S. (2016). SentiHood: Targeted Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Dataset for Urban Neighbourhoods. In Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers, 1546–1556.

- For **SemEval-2014 Task 4 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Pontiki, M., Galanis, D., Papageorgiou, H., Androutsopoulos, I., & Manandhar, S. (2014). SemEval-2014 Task 4: Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. In Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2014), 27–35.

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will be crucial for any downstream processing or review of the extracted information.
