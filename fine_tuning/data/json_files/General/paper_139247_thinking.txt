To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Head-wise Shareable Attention for Large Language Models" by Zouying Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation. 

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) and mention that they evaluate their methods on several datasets. This indicates that there are datasets to be found, but I need to locate their specific names.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly any subsections that explicitly mention datasets. In this paper, the authors refer to three datasets in the context of their experiments: **WMT14 (En-Fr)**, **CommonsenseQA**, and **WSC**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including their purpose and any specific characteristics mentioned.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **WMT14 (En-Fr)**:
   > Ondrej Bojar et al. *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 12–58, Baltimore, Maryland, USA, 2014.

2. **CommonsenseQA**:
   > Alon Talmor et al. *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pages 4149–4158, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2019.

3. **WSC**:
   > Hector Levesque et al. *The Winograd Schema Challenge*. In Thirteenth International Conference on the Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
