To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Taking a Step Back with KCal: Multi-Class Kernel-Based Calibration for Deep Neural Networks" by Zhen Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, related work, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across a variety of datasets, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a summary table (Table 1) that lists various datasets along with their splits and number of classes. This table is crucial for identifying the datasets used in their experiments.

From Table 1, I note the following datasets:

1. **IIIC Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying ictal-interictal-injury-continuum patterns. The authors mention that it contains 103,818 training samples, 1,787 calibration samples, and 33,953 test samples across 6 classes.

2. **ISRUC Dataset**: This dataset is for sleep staging and includes 1,936 training samples, 77 calibration samples, and 684 test samples across 6 classes.

3. **PN2017 Dataset**: This is an electrocardiogram dataset used for rhythm classification, with 15,087 training samples, 253 calibration samples, and 4,813 test samples across 4 classes.

4. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: A well-known dataset in computer vision, with 45,000 training samples, 5,000 calibration samples, and 10,000 test samples across 10 classes.

5. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, containing 45,000 training samples, 5,000 calibration samples, and 10,000 test samples.

6. **SVHN Dataset**: The Street View House Numbers dataset, with 65,931 training samples, 7,326 calibration samples, and 26,032 test samples across 10 classes.

7. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset with 1,281,167 training samples, 25,000 calibration samples, and 25,000 test samples across 1,000 classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are typically formatted according to the style used in the paper, which may include the authors, title, conference/journal, and year of publication.

For example, I will look for the following citations:

- **IIIC Dataset**: 
  > Jing, et al. (2021). *Automated ictal-interictal-injury-continuum detection/monitoring*. Massachusetts General Hospital EEG Archive.

- **ISRUC Dataset**: 
  > Khalighi, et al. (2016). *ISRUC-Sleep: A comprehensive public dataset for sleep researchers*. Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine.

- **PN2017 Dataset**: 
  > Clifford, et al. (2017). *AF classification from a short single lead ECG recording: The PhysioNet/computing in cardiology challenge 2017*. Computing in Cardiology.

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: 
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- **SVHN Dataset**: 
  > Netzer, Y., et al. (2011). *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*.

- **ImageNet Dataset**: 
  > Deng, J., et al. (2009). *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
