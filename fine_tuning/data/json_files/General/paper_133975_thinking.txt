To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CATE Lasso: Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimation with High-Dimensional Linear Regression" by Masahiro Kato and Masaaki Imaizumi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 8) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation of their methods. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP)** dataset, which consists of simulated outcomes and covariate data from a real study. They describe the dataset's structure, including the number of samples and types of covariates.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the study.

For the **IHDP dataset**, the citation is:
> Hill, J. L. (2011). Bayesian nonparametric modeling for causal inference. *Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics*, 20(1), 217-240.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that each entry is clear and complete.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
