To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate and Well-Calibrated ICD Code Assignment Through Attention Over Diverse Label Embeddings" by Gonçalo Gomes, Isabel Coutinho, and Bruno Martins, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments with the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used the **MIMIC-III dataset** for their experiments. They also mention two specific subsets of this dataset: **MIMIC-III-50** and **MIMIC-III-clean**. 

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed ICD coding methods. It is a publicly available dataset that contains clinical data.

2. **MIMIC-III-50**: This subset includes the top 50 most frequent ICD-9 codes from the MIMIC-III dataset. The authors mention that this subset was used to assess the performance of their model.

3. **MIMIC-III-clean**: This is a cleaned version of the MIMIC-III dataset, which contains 3,681 unique ICD-9 codes. The authors highlight that this version was used to ensure a more accurate evaluation of their model's performance.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MIMIC-III dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E. W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Liwei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3:1–9, 2016.

- For the **MIMIC-III-50 subset**, the citation is:
  > James Mullenbach, Sarah Wiegreffe, Jon Duke, Jimeng Sun, and Jacob Eisenstein. *Explainable prediction of medical codes from clinical text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05695, 2018.

- For the **MIMIC-III-clean subset**, the citation is:
  > Joakim Edin, Alexander Junge, Jakob D. Havtorn, Lasse Borgholt, Maria Maistro, Tuukka Ruotsalo, and Lars Maaløe. *Automated medical coding on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV: A critical review and replicability study*. In Proceedings of the International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
