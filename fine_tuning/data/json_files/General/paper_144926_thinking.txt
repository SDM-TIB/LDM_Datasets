To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jamming Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Blocker Documents" by Avital Shafran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their methods against several datasets, specifically **Natural Questions (NQ)** and **HotpotQA**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly section 6, where the authors discuss their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using the **Natural Questions (NQ)** dataset and the **HotpotQA** dataset for their experiments. This confirms that these are the datasets utilized in their research.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

1. For the **Natural Questions (NQ)** dataset, the citation is:
   > Kwiatkowski, T., Palomaki, J., Redfield, O., Collins, M., Parikh, A., Alberti, C., Epstein, D., Polosukhin, I., Devlin, K., Lee, K., et al. (2019). *Natural Questions: A Benchmark for Question Answering Research*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 7, 453-466.

2. For the **HotpotQA** dataset, the citation is:
   > Yang, Z., Qi, P., Zhang, S., Bengio, Y., Cohen, W., Salakhutdinov, R., & Manning, C. D. (2018). *HotpotQA: A Dataset for Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2730-2740.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will facilitate easy reference for anyone interested in the datasets used in this research.
