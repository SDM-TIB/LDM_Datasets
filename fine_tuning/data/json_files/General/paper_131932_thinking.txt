To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Is Solving Graph Neural Tangent Kernel Equivalent to Training Graph Neural Network?" by Lianke Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of Graph Neural Tangent Kernel (GNTK) on various bioinformatics datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (if available) to find specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. In this paper, the authors refer to "various bioinformatics datasets" but do not specify them in the abstract. Therefore, I will look for a dedicated section that lists the datasets.

Upon reviewing the **main body of the paper**, I will pay particular attention to sections that discuss methodology or experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors provide details about the datasets, I will note them down.

In the **related work section**, the authors may reference previous studies that utilized specific datasets. I will extract any dataset names mentioned here as well.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. I will look for papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Cora" or "PubMed," I will find the original papers that introduced these datasets and note their full citations.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and related work for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Note down any dataset names, descriptions, and characteristics.
4. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
5. Compile the information into a structured format with proper citations.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
