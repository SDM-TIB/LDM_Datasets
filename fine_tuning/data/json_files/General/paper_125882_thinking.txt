To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-to-Single Knowledge Distillation for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation" by Shoumeng Qiu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on the **SemanticKITTI dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely central to the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors discuss the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the **SemanticKITTI dataset** and provide a brief description of its characteristics, such as being a large-scale dataset for semantic scene understanding using LiDAR sequences, and its challenges with rare classes.

In the **experiments section**, the authors also highlight the specific classes they defined as "hard classes" for their experiments, which include bicycle, motorcycle, truck, other-vehicle, person, bicyclist, motorcyclist, and traffic-sign. This reinforces the importance of the SemanticKITTI dataset in their work.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemanticKITTI dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- **SemanticKITTI Dataset**:

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the dataset details as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: SemanticKITTI
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset for semantic scene understanding using LiDAR sequences, featuring dense semantic annotations for the entire KITTI Odometry Benchmark. It presents challenges on rare classes due to the limited training examples.
   - **Citation**: J. Behley, M. Garbade, A. Milioto, J. Quenzel, S. Behnke, C. Stachniss, and J. Gall. *SemanticKITTI: A Dataset for Semantic Scene Understanding of LiDAR Sequences*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019, pp. 9297–9307.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
