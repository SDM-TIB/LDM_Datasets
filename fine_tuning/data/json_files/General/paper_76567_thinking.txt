To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bone marrow cells detection: A technique for the microscopic image analysis" by Haichao Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction may mention the significance of datasets used in the study.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, as it typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used for experiments. In this section, the authors mention that the sample set consists of **48,037 100-times microscopic images of bone marrow samples**. This indicates a substantial dataset used for their analysis.

I will also look for any specific names or identifiers for the dataset. The authors mention that the dataset includes various types of bone marrow cells, which suggests that it is a comprehensive dataset for training and testing their proposed methods.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of their methods on the dataset, which reinforces the importance of the dataset in their experiments. They also provide details about the training and testing sets, including the number of samples for each type of bone marrow cell.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, it appears that the dataset is original and not derived from previously published datasets, so there may not be external citations for it.

Based on my findings, I will document the dataset as follows:

1. **Bone Marrow Cell Dataset**: This dataset consists of 48,037 100-times microscopic images of bone marrow samples, which include various types of bone marrow cells such as neutrophilic split granulocyte, neutrophilic stab granulocyte, metarubricyte, mature lymphocytes, and outlier cells.

Since the dataset is original to this study, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- For the Bone Marrow Cell Dataset, the citation is:
  > Haichao Cao, Hong Liu, Enmin Song. *Bone marrow cells detection: A technique for the microscopic image analysis*. Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
