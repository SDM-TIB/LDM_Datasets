To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deeper Learning with CoLU Activation Function" by Advait Vagerwal, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the CoLU activation function on various datasets, specifically mentioning **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **Cifar-10**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 3) in detail, as it is likely to contain specific information about how each dataset was used. In section 3.1, the author describes experiments conducted on the **MNIST** dataset, detailing the training process and results. In section 3.2, the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset is discussed, including the model used and the results obtained. Finally, in section 3.3, the **Cifar-10** dataset is mentioned, along with the training details and performance metrics.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for handwritten digit classification. The paper mentions that CoLU was tested on neural networks trained on MNIST, showing superior performance compared to other activation functions.

2. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset serves as a drop-in replacement for MNIST, containing images of clothing items. The paper reports that CoLU achieved a 4.20% higher accuracy than Mish and 3.31% higher than ReLU when trained on this dataset.

3. **Cifar-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The paper indicates that CoLU was tested on a ResNet-9 model trained on Cifar-10, where it outperformed other activation functions in terms of accuracy.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The MNIST dataset is commonly cited, and I will use the standard citation. The Fashion-MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets also have established citations that I will include.

The citations I will use are:

- For **MNIST**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **Cifar-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
