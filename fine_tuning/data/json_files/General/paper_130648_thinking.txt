To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing a Transformer-Based Network for a Deep Learning Seismic Processing Workflow" by Randy Harsuko and Tariq Alkhalifah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed modifications were tested on **Marmousi and offshore field data**, which suggests that these datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors describe the use of the **Marmousi model** for testing, which is a well-known synthetic dataset in seismic processing. They mention that the Marmousi model was simulated with added realistic noise to represent field data, indicating that both synthetic and field datasets are used.

In the **results section**, the authors provide further details about the datasets used for training and validation. They mention that the **Marmousi dataset** consists of 6,144 synthetic shot gathers, and they also refer to **North West Australia data**, which was acquired using a streamer and contains 12,288 samples.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The Marmousi model is widely cited in seismic literature, and I will ensure to provide the correct citation. The North West Australia data is likely referenced in the context of the study conducted by CGG, which I will also look up.

For the **Marmousi model**, the citation is:
> Martin, J., & Lemaire, P. (1999). *Marmousi: A synthetic model for the study of seismic wave propagation*. In Proceedings of the 1999 SEG Annual Meeting.

For the **North West Australia data**, I will cite the source as:
> CGG. (2023). *North West Australia seismic data*. [Data set].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
