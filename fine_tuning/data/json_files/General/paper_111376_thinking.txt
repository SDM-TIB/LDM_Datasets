To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dataset Pruning: Reducing Training Data by Examining Generalization Influence" by Shuo Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their research. The introduction further elaborates on the challenges of training data and hints at the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their dataset pruning method on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **TinyImageNet** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: The citation is the same as CIFAR-10 since it is an extension of the CIFAR-10 dataset:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

3. **TinyImageNet Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset's name, description, and citation in the required format.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
