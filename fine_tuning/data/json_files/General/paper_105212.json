        "dcterms:description": "The MI-2 dataset consists of EEG recordings from 25 right-handed healthy subjects performing three different tasks of imagining joint movements of the same limb, including imagining grasp movement, imagining right elbow movement, and keeping a resting state with eyes open. The EEG signals were recorded using a 64-channel gel electrode cap of the standard 10/20 system, with a validity period of each record being 4 seconds.",
