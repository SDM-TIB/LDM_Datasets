To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AFINet: Attentive Feature Integration Networks for Image Classification" by Xinglin Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieved a relative improvement on the **ImageNet dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets they used for training and evaluation. They mention that their models were trained on **ImageNet** and evaluated on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets.

Now, I will gather detailed descriptions of these datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is widely known and consists of approximately 1.3 million training images and 50,000 validation images, used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 RGB images in 10 classes, with 50,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. Each image is 32x32 pixels.

3. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset consists of 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L. Li, K. Li, and F. Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
