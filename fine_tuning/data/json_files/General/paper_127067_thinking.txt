To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ambiguity Meets Uncertainty: Investigating Uncertainty Estimation for Word Sense Disambiguation" by Zhu Liu and Ying Liu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses uncertainty estimation in word sense disambiguation (WSD) and hints at the use of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Model and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to several datasets:

1. **SemCor**: This is a standard training dataset for WSD, which is mentioned as being used to train their model. It is crucial to note that this dataset is foundational for their experiments.

2. **Unified Evaluation Framework for English all-words WSD**: This framework includes five standard datasets:
   - **Senseval-2**
   - **Senseval-3**
   - **SemEval-2007**
   - **SemEval-2013**
   - **SemEval-2015**

The authors also mention using a portion of **SemEval-2007** for investigating data uncertainty and the **42D dataset** for model uncertainty, which is specifically designed for a more challenging benchmark in WSD.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SemCor**, the citation is:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
