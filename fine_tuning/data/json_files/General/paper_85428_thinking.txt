To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scalable Bayesian Non-linear Matrix Completion" by Xiangju Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method using both simulated and real-world data, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two types of data:

1. **Simulated Data**: The authors generated synthetic data using non-linear signals corrupted with Gaussian noise. They specify that the data has three views with dimensions N = 25,000, D1 = 150, D2 = 100, D3 = 150. This dataset is used for out-of-matrix prediction tasks.

2. **ExCAPE-DB Data**: This is a real-world dataset that aggregates public compound-target bioactivity data. It describes interactions between drugs and targets using the pIC50 measure, with 969,725 compounds and 806 targets, totaling 76,384,863 observed bioactivities. The dataset also includes 469 chem2vec features as side information.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ExCAPE-DB**, the citation is:
  > Jiangming Sun, Nina Jeliazkova, Vladimir Chupakhin, Jose-Felipe Golib-Dzib, Ola Engkvist, Lars Carlsson, Jörg Wegner, Hugo Ceulemans, Ivan Georgiev, Vedrin Jeliazkov, Nikolay Kochev, Thomas J. Ashby, and Hongming Chen. *ExCAPE-DB: an integrated large scale dataset facilitating big data analysis in chemogenomics*. Journal of Cheminformatics, 9(1):17:1–17:9, 2017.

The simulated data does not have a specific citation since it is generated by the authors for the purpose of the study, but I will note its description for completeness.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
