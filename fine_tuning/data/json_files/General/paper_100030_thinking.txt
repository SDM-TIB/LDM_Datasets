To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Example Detection for DNN Models: A Review and Experimental Comparison" by Ahmed Aldahdooh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide experimental results on **four datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the introduction, the authors mention evaluating detection methods on four datasets, which is a clear indication that I should find their names and details.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST**: A handwriting digit recognition dataset containing 70,000 gray images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
2. **SVHN**: A real street view house numbers recognition dataset with 99,289 RGB images (73,257 for training and 26,032 for testing).
3. **CIFAR-10**: A collection of 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes (50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
4. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet containing 110,000 images across 200 classes (100,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- **MNIST**:

- **SVHN**:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
