To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Incomplete-View CT Reconstruction with Prompted Contextual Transformer" by Chenglong Ma et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research context and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments using publicly available datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental setup)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **DeepLesion Dataset**: The authors state that they randomly selected 10,000 images from 3,012 patients for training and 1,000 images from 24 patients for testing. This dataset is crucial for their experiments.

2. **AAPM Dataset**: The authors mention that they selected 1,145 images from 2 patients as an external test set. This dataset is also important for validating their model's performance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **DeepLesion Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ke Yan, Xiaosong Wang, Le Lu, and Ronald M Summers. *DeepLesion: Automated mining of large-scale lesion annotations and universal lesion detection with deep learning*. Journal of Medical Imaging, 5(3):036501–036501, 2018.

- For the **AAPM Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cynthia H. McCollough, Adam C. Bartley, Rickey E. Carter, Baiyu Chen, Tammy A. Drees, Phillip Edwards, David R. Holmes III, Alice E. Huang, Farhana Khan, Shuai Leng, Kyle L. McMillan, Gregory J. Michalak, Kristina M. Nunez, Lifeng Yu, and Joel G. Fletcher. *Low-dose CT for the detection and classification of metastatic liver lesions: Results of the 2016 low dose CT grand challenge*. Medical Physics, 44(10):e339–e352, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented by the authors.
