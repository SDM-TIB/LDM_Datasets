To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Safe Nonlinear Control Using Robust Neural Lyapunov-Barrier Functions" by Charles Dawson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets or benchmarks that are utilized in their experiments.

In the experiments section, the authors detail various tasks and simulations, such as **car trajectory tracking**, **UAV stabilization**, and **navigation with non-convex safety constraints**. I will note any datasets or benchmarks that are referenced in relation to these tasks.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a specific dataset like the **CommonRoad benchmarks** for their experiments, I will look for the corresponding citation in the references. If the dataset is not explicitly cited, I will note the context in which it is used and any relevant details provided in the text.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the full citation for each dataset as it appears in the references. This will involve carefully formatting the citations according to academic standards.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
