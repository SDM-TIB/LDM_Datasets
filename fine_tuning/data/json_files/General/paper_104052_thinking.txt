To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Modal Multi-Instance Learning for Retinal Disease Recognition" by Xirong Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on a real-world dataset consisting of 1,206 multi-modal cases. This indicates that there is a dataset central to their research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors describe the dataset as being collected from an outpatient clinic using a specific fundus camera, which provides important context about the dataset's origin.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset, including the number of cases, the types of diseases included, and the method of data collection. They mention that the dataset consists of multi-modal cases with color fundus photographs (CFP) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scan images, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

I will also check the **evaluation** section, where they discuss the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of subjects and the distribution of diseases. This information is vital for accurately describing the dataset.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multi-modal Retinal Disease Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 1,206 multi-modal cases collected from 1,193 eyes of 836 subjects. Each case includes a color fundus photograph (CFP) and 12 OCT B-scan images, labeled for six vision-threatening diseases: epiretinal membrane (ERM), macular edema (ME), diabetic retinopathy (DR), dry age-related macular degeneration (dryAMD), wet AMD, and pathological myopia (PM).
   - **Citation**:

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation, ready for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant information is included.
