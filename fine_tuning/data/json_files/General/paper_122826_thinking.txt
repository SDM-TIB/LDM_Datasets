To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harris Hawks Feature Selection in Distributed Machine Learning for Secure IoT Environments" by Neveen Hijazi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method using "two benchmark datasets for IoT botnet attacks," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Methodology)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention the two datasets used:

1. **N-BaIoT Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and represents a real IoT network consisting of nine devices. The authors note that it contains 7,062,606 instances and 115 features, with data collected during normal operations and various attacks.

2. **Phishing Legitimate Dataset**: This dataset is collected from Kaggle and comprises 48 features extracted from 10,000 web pages, with 5,000 being phishing pages and the other 5,000 being legitimate ones.

To confirm the details and obtain the full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **N-BaIoT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Meidan, M. Bohadana, Y. Mathov, Y. Mirsky, A. Shabtai, D. Breitenbacher, and Y. Elovici. *N-baiot—network-based detection of IoT botnet attacks using deep autoencoders*. IEEE Pervasive Computing, vol. 17, no. 3, pp. 12–22, 2018.

- For the **Phishing Legitimate Dataset**, the citation is:
  > C. L. Tan. *Phishing dataset for machine learning: Feature evaluation*. Mendeley Data, vol. 1, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the information clearly, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review.
