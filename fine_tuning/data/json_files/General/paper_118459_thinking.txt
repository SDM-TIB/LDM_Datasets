To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Scale Real-World Multi-Person Tracking" by Bing Shuai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces the **PersonPath22 dataset**, which is a large-scale multi-person tracking dataset. This is a clear indication that I need to gather more details about this dataset.

Next, I will look into the **Methods** or **Dataset** section, which is likely to provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this paper, the authors specifically describe the **PersonPath22 dataset** in section 5. Here, they provide key statistics, such as the number of videos, annotated frames, and unique person tracks. They also mention that the dataset consists of 236 videos, with a total of 12,150 unique person tracks annotated.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **PersonPath22 dataset**. The paper does not provide a separate citation for the dataset itself, but it references other datasets like **MOT17**, **HiEve**, and **MOT20**. I will ensure to include these citations as they are compared to the PersonPath22 dataset.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **MOT17 Dataset**:
   > Milan, A., Leal-Taixé, L., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2016). *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

2. **HiEve Dataset**:
   > Lin, W., Liu, H., Liu, S., Li, Y., Qian, R., Wang, T., Xu, N., Xiong, H., Qi, G.J., & Sebe, N. (2020). *Human in events: A large-scale benchmark for human-centric video analysis in complex events*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.04490.

3. **MOT20 Dataset**:
   > Dendorfer, P., Rezatofighi, H., Milan, A., Shi, J., Cremers, D., Reid, I., Roth, S., Schindler, K., & Leal-Taixé, L. (2020). *MOT20: A benchmark for multi object tracking in crowded scenes*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.09003.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets mentioned in the paper along with their full citations.
