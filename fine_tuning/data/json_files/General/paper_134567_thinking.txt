To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Fragility of Sparsity" by Michal Kolesár, Ulrich K. Müller, and Sebastian T. Roelsgaard, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses empirical applications but does not specify any datasets directly. The introduction elaborates on the use of sparsity-based estimators (SBEs) and their implications but does not name specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **empirical illustrations section (Section 2)**, where the authors describe three applications that leverage SBEs. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in these applications. 

1. **Application 1**: The authors reference the empirical illustration in Belloni et al. (2014) regarding the effect of abortion on crime. They mention using an annual panel of US states from **1985 to 1997**. I will need to find the full citation for this dataset.
   
2. **Application 2**: The second application is based on Ferrara (2022), which studies occupational upgrading of Black workers post-WW2. The authors mention using a decennial panel of county-level observations in **16 predominantly Southern US states**. I will also need to find the full citation for this dataset.

3. **Application 3**: The third application is based on Enke (2020), which examines the relationship between moral values and voting behavior. The authors mention using survey data but do not specify the dataset name. I will need to look for the citation for this survey data.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the empirical applications. 

- For the **Belloni et al. (2014)** dataset, I will look for the full citation of their work on the effect of abortion on crime.
- For the **Ferrara (2022)** dataset, I will find the citation for the study on occupational upgrading.
- For the **Enke (2020)** dataset, I will locate the citation for the survey data used in his analysis.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
