To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CERIST’22: Classifying COVID-19 Related Tweets for Fake News Detection and Sentiment Analysis with BERT-based Models" by Rabia Bounaama and Mohammed El Amine Abderrahim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used an available dataset related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes tweets for sentiment analysis and fake news detection tasks. This suggests that there are specific datasets I need to look for.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Task1.c Dataset**: This dataset comprises 4,128 tweets for the sentiment analysis task and 8,661 tweets for the fake news detection task. The paper does not provide a specific name for this dataset, but it is referred to as "task1.c" related to the CERIST’22 challenge.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for the "task1.c" dataset, as it is likely a dataset created for the challenge and may not have a separate publication.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will note that the dataset is part of the CERIST’22 shared tasks and provide the relevant information as follows:

- For the **Task1.c Dataset**, I will include the following details:
  - Description: A dataset containing 4,128 tweets for sentiment analysis and 8,661 tweets for fake news detection, specifically designed for the CERIST’22 challenge.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the relevant details and any necessary citations, even if they are not formally published. This will help in maintaining clarity and providing proper attribution for the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
