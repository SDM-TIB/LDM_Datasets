To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Label-Correlation Enhancement for Congestion Prediction" by Biao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is validated on two publicly available benchmarks: **ISPD2011** and **DAC2012**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section IV) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They explicitly state that the ISPD2011 dataset consists of multiple designs, and they selected specific designs for training, validation, and testing. Similarly, they describe the DAC2012 dataset and how it is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **ISPD2011 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method. The authors mention that designs 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12 are selected for training, design 15 for validation, and design 19 for testing.

2. **DAC2012 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for evaluation, with designs 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12 for training, design 16 for validation, and design 19 for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ISPD2011 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Natarajan Viswanathan, Charles J Alpert, Cliff Sze, Zhuo Li, Gi-Joon Nam, and Jarrod A Roy. *The ispd-2011 routability-driven placement contest and benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the 2011 international symposium on Physical design, pages 141–146, 2011.

- For the **DAC2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Natarajan Viswanathan, Charles Alpert, Cliff Sze, Zhuo Li, and Yaoguang Wei. *The dac 2012 routability-driven placement contest and benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Design Automation Conference, pages 774–782, 2012.

Having gathered all necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This will provide a clear and structured output for further processing or review.
