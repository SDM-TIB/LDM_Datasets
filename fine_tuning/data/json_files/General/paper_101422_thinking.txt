To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scaling-up Diverse Orthogonal Convolutional Networks with a Paraunitary Framework" by Furong Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. If there is a section specifically titled "Datasets," I will focus on that for detailed information.

In this paper, I will pay attention to any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for training or testing their models, I will note the dataset's name, size, and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly, ready for any further processing or review.
