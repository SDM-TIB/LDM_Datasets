To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel Attention Transformer (KAT) for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification" by Yushan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their method on a **gastric dataset with 2040 WSIs** and an **endometrial dataset with 2560 WSIs**. This indicates that there are at least two datasets that I need to extract.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 3) where the authors provide more details about these datasets. They describe the **Gastric-2K dataset**, which contains 2040 WSIs categorized into 6 subtypes of gastric pathology, and the **Endometrial-2K dataset**, which contains 2560 WSIs categorized into 5 subtypes of endometrial pathology. This confirms the datasets I need to focus on.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **Gastric-2K Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2040 whole slide images of gastric histopathology from 2040 patients, categorized into 6 subtypes of gastric pathology.

2. **Endometrial-2K Dataset**: This dataset contains 2560 whole slide images of endometrial histopathology from 2560 patients, categorized into 5 subtypes of endometrial pathology.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are not attributed to specific papers in the references, which is common for datasets that are created for specific studies. In this case, I will note that the datasets are described in the paper itself, and I will provide the details as follows:

- For the **Gastric-2K dataset**, I will cite it as:
  > Zheng, Y., Li, J., Shi, J., Xie, F., & Jiang, Z. (2023). Kernel Attention Transformer (KAT) for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification. *Proceedings of the [Conference Name]*, [Page Numbers]. 

- For the **Endometrial-2K dataset**, I will use the same citation format:
  > Zheng, Y., Li, J., Shi, J., Xie, F., & Jiang, Z. (2023). Kernel Attention Transformer (KAT) for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification. *Proceedings of the [Conference Name]*, [Page Numbers]. 

Since the datasets are part of the study and not published separately, I will reference them as part of the paper's contribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in this research paper.
