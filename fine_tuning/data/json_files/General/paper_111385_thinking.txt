To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Time-varying Constrained Online Convex Optimization" by Haoyang Liu, Xiantao Xiao, and Liwei Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and applications, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may provide context or references to datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their algorithms. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant citations.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors discuss three numerical examples: **online network resource allocation**, **online logistic regression**, and **online quadratically constrained quadratical program**. Each of these examples likely utilizes specific datasets.

1. **Online Network Resource Allocation**: The authors mention a cloud network represented by a directed graph with nodes and edges. However, they do not provide a specific dataset name but describe the parameters and how they are generated.

2. **Online Logistic Regression**: The authors describe the generation of training data recursively, but again, no specific dataset name is provided. They mention that the data is generated uniformly and recursively.

3. **Online Quadratically Constrained Quadratical Program**: Similar to the previous examples, the authors describe the generation of matrices and vectors used in the optimization problem but do not cite a specific dataset.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or citations, I will check the **References section** for any papers that might describe datasets related to the examples used in the experiments. 

Upon reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several works that may contain relevant datasets or methodologies. However, they do not provide direct citations for specific datasets used in their experiments.

In conclusion, while I can summarize the types of datasets used (e.g., generated data for online optimization problems), I cannot provide full citations for specific datasets as they are not explicitly mentioned in the paper. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are generated based on the described methods rather than sourced from existing datasets.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for review or further processing.
