To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mobile Edge Adversarial Detection for Digital Twinning to the Metaverse with Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Terence Jie Chua et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, I will look for any specific datasets that are utilized for training or testing their proposed methods. 

In the **methodology section**, the authors mention using adversarial patches inserted into images from two datasets: **Stanford-Cars** and **nuImages**. They specify that they used 2000 images from each dataset to simulate the placement of physical adversarial patches. This is a clear indication that these datasets are integral to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. For the **Stanford-Cars dataset**, the citation is:
   > Krause, J., Deng, J., Stark, M., & Fei-Fei, L. (2013). *Collecting a large-scale dataset of fine-grained cars*.

2. For the **nuImages dataset**, the citation is:
   > Caesar, H., Bankiti, V., Lang, A. H., Vora, S., Liong, V. E., Xu, Q., Krishnan, A., Pan, Y., Baldan, G., & Beijbom, O. (2019). *nuscenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1903.11027.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
