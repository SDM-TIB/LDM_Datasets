To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning Based Analysis of Prostate Cancer from MP-MRI" by Pedro David Carneiro Neto, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may include references to specific datasets. In the introduction, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **background** section, particularly focusing on any subsections that discuss datasets or previous works that may have utilized specific datasets. This section often provides context and may reference well-known datasets in the field.

I will then navigate to the **methods** section, where the author typically describes the experimental setup. This section is crucial as it often details the datasets used for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Following that, I will check the **experiments and results** section. Here, the author may provide additional insights into the datasets used, including any performance metrics associated with them. This section may also confirm the datasets mentioned earlier and provide context on how they were utilized in the experiments.

Finally, I will consult the **bibliography** or **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

Based on my findings, I will document each dataset, including its name, a brief description, and the full citation. For example, if the paper mentions the **IMPROD dataset**, I would note its purpose, the number of samples, and the citation as follows:

- **IMPROD Dataset**: A dataset containing multi-parametric MRI images, biomarkers, segmentation masks, and lesion scores for 157 men with prostate cancer.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of use in future research or applications.
