To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Graph Enhanced BERT Model for Event Prediction" by Li Du et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on two event prediction tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two specific tasks: the **Multiple Choice Narrative Cloze Task (MCNC)** and the **Story Cloze Test (SCT)**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any statistics provided.

For the **MCNC dataset**, the authors provide statistics such as the number of documents, event chains, unique events, and uncovered events for the training, development, and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope.

For the **SCT dataset**, the authors describe it as containing a five-sentence story training set with specific instances for training, development, and testing. I will note the details provided about the structure and purpose of this dataset.

After gathering the necessary information about the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations I will look for include:

1. For the **Multiple Choice Narrative Cloze Task (MCNC)**, I will find the original paper by Granroth and Clark (2016) that introduced this task.
2. For the **Story Cloze Test (SCT)**, I will locate the original paper by Mostafazadeh et al. (2016) that describes this dataset.

Once I have the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, ensuring that the full citations are included for reference.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
