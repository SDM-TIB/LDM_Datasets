To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiple Hypothesis Dropout: Estimating the Parameters of Multi-Modal Output Distributions" by David D. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically:

1. **FashionMNIST**: A dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, commonly used as a benchmark for machine learning algorithms.
2. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset with 64x64 images, containing various attributes for each face, which is often used in generative modeling tasks.
3. **ImageNet**: A well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 64x64 images across thousands of categories.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **FashionMNIST**:
  > Xiao, H., Rasul, K., & Vollgraf, R. (2017). Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747*.

- For **CelebA**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2018). Large-scale celebfaces attributes (CelebA) dataset. *Retrieved August, 15(2018): 11*.

- For **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database. In *2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition*, 248â€“255. IEEE.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
