To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Learning for Unsupervised Feature Selection" by Atsutoshi Kumagai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **MNIST-r**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset by rotating images at various angles. It consists of six tasks, each with 1,000 images represented as 256-dimensional vectors.

2. **Isolet**: This dataset contains recordings of letters spoken by 150 speakers, grouped into five tasks based on speaking similarity. Each instance is represented as a 617-dimensional vector.

3. **Amazon**: This dataset consists of product reviews across four categories (kitchen appliances, DVDs, books, and electronics), with each task having 1,000 positive and 1,000 negative reviews. The feature dimension is 400.

4. **VLCS**: This dataset includes real images from four sources (VOC2007, LabelMe, Caltech-101, and SUN09), with each image represented by 4096-dimensional features.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST** (the original dataset):
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **Isolet**:
  > D. P. Kingma and M. Welling. *Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2014.

- For **Amazon**:
  > B. Gong, K. Grauman, and F. Sha. *Connecting the Dots with Landmarks: Discriminatively Learning Domain-Invariant Features for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation*. In ICML, 2013.

- For **VLCS**:
  > A. Torralba, R. Fergus, and W. T. Freeman. *80 Million Tiny Images: A Large Data Set for Nonparametric Object and Scene Recognition*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 30(11):1958-1970, 2008.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
