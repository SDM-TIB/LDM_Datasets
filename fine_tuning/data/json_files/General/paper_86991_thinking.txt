To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPEC2: SPECtral SParsE CNN Accelerator on FPGAs" by Yue Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the implementation of SPEC2 on LeNet and VGG16, which suggests that datasets related to these models may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors mention using **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they evaluate the accuracy of their model on the MNIST dataset (for LeNet) and the CIFAR-10 dataset (for VGG16). This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
