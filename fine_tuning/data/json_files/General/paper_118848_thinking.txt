To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Model Classifier Aligns Better with Physician Word Sensitivity than XGBoost on Readmission Prediction" by Ming Cao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating models on a readmission dataset derived from MIMIC-III, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **MIMIC-III Dataset**: This dataset is derived from electronic health records of ICU patients at the Beth Israel Hospital. It contains 52,725 examples with a binary label for readmission, indicating whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days of discharge. The dataset is split into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.

2. **NYU Readmissions Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from the NYU Langone Health System and consists of 45,120 examples from various clinical departments, with 10.67% of the examples labeled as positive for readmission.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MIMIC-III Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alistair E.W. Johnson, Tom J. Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H. Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G. Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific Data, 3(1):160035, 2016. doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.35. URL: http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635.

- For the **NYU Readmissions Dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as part of an IRB-approved study. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is from NYU Langone Health System but will not provide a formal citation since it is not available in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. 

After completing this process, I will have a clear and structured representation of the datasets used in the research, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details and citations for each dataset.
