To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Unified Object Counting Network with Object Occupation Prior" by Shengqin Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors have built the first evolving object counting dataset, which suggests that a dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of the counting task and mention the creation of a dataset called **EoCo**. They state that this dataset includes 6885 samples, which is a significant detail that I need to note.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about the EoCo dataset, including its composition. They mention that the dataset is divided into two parts: Part A and Part B, with specific classes and sample distributions outlined in tables. I will extract the relevant details about these parts, including the number of samples and the classes involved.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The authors refer to existing datasets such as **ShanghaiTech Part A** and **ShanghaiTech Part B**, which are used for comparison. I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for these datasets as well.

The full citations I need to extract are:

1. **EoCo Dataset** (the dataset created by the authors):
   > Jiang, S., Wang, Q., Cheng, F., Qi, Y., & Liu, Q. (2023). A Unified Object Counting Network with Object Occupation Prior. *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, XX(X), XX-XX. [Dataset available at: https://github.com/Tanyjiang/EOCO]

2. **ShanghaiTech Part A**:
   > Zhang, Y., Zhou, D., Chen, S., Gao, S., & Ma, Y. (2016). Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 589-597).

3. **ShanghaiTech Part B**:
   > Zhang, Y., Zhou, D., Chen, S., Gao, S., & Ma, Y. (2016). Single-image crowd counting via multi-column convolutional neural network. In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition* (pp. 589-597).

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
