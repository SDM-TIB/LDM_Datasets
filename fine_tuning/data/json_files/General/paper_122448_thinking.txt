To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tuning Computer Vision Models with Task Rewards" by AndrÃ© Susano Pinto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method across multiple computer vision tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to look for explicit mentions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In section 4.1 (Panoptic Segmentation), the authors mention using the **COCO panoptic dataset** for training their model. I will note this dataset and look for its full citation in the references section.

In section 4.2 (Object Detection), the authors state that they pretrain their model on the **Objects365 dataset** and fine-tune it on the **COCO dataset**. I will document both of these datasets and check the references for their full citations.

In section 4.3 (Colorization), the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset** for training their colorization model. I will also include this dataset and find its citation.

In section 4.4 (Image Captioning), the authors indicate that they pretrain their model on the **COCO captions dataset**. I will note this dataset as well.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of the datasets identified:

1. **COCO Panoptic Dataset**:
   > Kirillov, A., He, K., Girshick, R., Rother, C., and Dollar, P. *Panoptic segmentation*. In CVPR, 2019.

2. **Objects365 Dataset**:
   > Shao, S., Li, Z., Zhang, T., Peng, C., Yu, G., Zhang, X., Li, J., and Sun, J. *Objects365: A large-scale, high-quality dataset for object detection*. In ICCV, 2019.

3. **COCO Dataset**:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollar, P., and Zitnick, C. L. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

4. **ImageNet Dataset**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

5. **COCO Captions Dataset**:
   > Karpathy, A. and Fei-Fei, L. *Deep visual-semantic alignments for generating image descriptions*. In CVPR, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
