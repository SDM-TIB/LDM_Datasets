To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unconstrained Fashion Landmark Detection via Hierarchical Recurrent Transformer Networks" by Sijie Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "large-scale fashion landmark dataset, namely Unconstrained Landmark Database (ULD)," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of fashion landmark detection and the need for datasets that reflect real-world variations. They specifically mention the **Unconstrained Landmark Database (ULD)**, which consists of 30K images with comprehensive fashion landmark annotations. This is a key dataset for their research.

In the **database section**, the authors provide further details about ULD, including its collection from fashion blogs and forums, and how it differs from existing datasets like the Fashion Landmark Detection dataset (FLD). They emphasize that ULD is more challenging due to variations in scale, background clutter, and human poses.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the ULD dataset. The paper does not provide a separate citation for ULD, but it mentions that it is a contribution to the community, which implies that it may not have a formal citation yet. However, the authors reference the **Deep Fashion** dataset, which is relevant to the context of their work.

The citation for the Deep Fashion dataset is:
> Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

Now, I will compile the dataset information:

1. **Unconstrained Landmark Database (ULD)**: A large-scale dataset consisting of 30K images with comprehensive fashion landmark annotations, collected from various online sources.

2. **Deep Fashion Dataset**: A dataset that provides rich annotations for clothes recognition and retrieval, which is relevant to the context of the research.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset ready for inclusion in the structured output. This will help in maintaining proper academic referencing and facilitate further research in this area.
