To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Regionlets: Blended Representation and Deep Learning for Generic Object Detection" by Hongyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on the **PASCAL VOC dataset** and the **Microsoft COCO dataset**, which indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 6, where they explicitly mention using the **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO** datasets for evaluation. This confirms that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used. 

1. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as a benchmark for object detection, containing various object categories. The authors refer to it in the context of their experimental results, indicating its significance in evaluating their proposed method.

2. **Microsoft COCO Dataset**: Similar to PASCAL VOC, this dataset is also highlighted as a benchmark for object detection. The authors mention using the COCO 2017 trainval split for training and report results on the COCO-style average precision.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. J. V. Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. M. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

- For the **Microsoft COCO dataset**, the citation is:
  > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. J. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
