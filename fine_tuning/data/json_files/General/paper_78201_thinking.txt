To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer-aided diagnosis of lung nodule using gradient tree boosting and Bayesian optimization" by Mizuho Nishio et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract states that the study included "99 lung nodules (62 lung cancers and 37 benign lung nodules) were included from public databases of CT images." This indicates that there are datasets involved, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **methods** sections for more detailed information about the datasets. In the methods section, the authors mention using CT images from **The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)**, specifically two sets: one from the **LUNGx Challenge** and another from **NSCLC Radiogenomics**. This is crucial information as it identifies the datasets used in the study.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets, such as their contents and how they were utilized in the study. The authors describe that the LUNGx Challenge provided 60 test sets of chest CT images with 73 lung nodules, while the NSCLC Radiogenomics dataset included 26 sets of chest CT images that also contained lung cancer cases. Together, these datasets comprised a total of 99 lung nodules used for the CADx system evaluation.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **LUNGx Challenge** dataset:
   > Armato III, S.G. et al. LUNGx Challenge for computerized lung nodule classification: reflections and lessons learned. *J. Med. Imag.* (Bellingham, Wash). 2, 20103 (2015).

2. For the **NSCLC Radiogenomics** dataset:
   > Napel, S. & Plevritis, S.K. NSCLC radiogenomics: initial Stanford study of 26 cases. *Cancer Imag. Arch.* http://doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2014.X7ONY6B1 (2014).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **LUNGx Challenge Dataset**: This dataset consists of 60 test sets of chest CT images, including 73 lung nodules (36 lung cancers and 37 benign nodules). It is used for evaluating the CADx system.

2. **NSCLC Radiogenomics Dataset**: This dataset includes 26 sets of chest CT images, all containing lung cancer cases. It is also used in conjunction with the LUNGx Challenge dataset for the CADx system evaluation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly referenced. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all necessary details for each dataset used in the study.
