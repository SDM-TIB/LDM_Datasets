To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple yet Effective Network based on Vision Transformer for Camouflaged Object and Salient Object Detection" by Chao Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the tasks (Camouflaged Object Detection and Salient Object Detection) and hints at the use of benchmark datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the challenges and previous works related to COD and SOD. This section may contain references to specific datasets used in prior research.

In the **experiments section**, particularly in **Table I**, the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. Here, I will find the following datasets explicitly listed:

1. **CAMO**: Contains 1,000 training images and 250 testing images.
2. **CHAMELEON**: Contains 76 testing images (no training images).
3. **COD10K**: Contains 3,040 training images and 2,026 testing images.
4. **NC4K**: Contains 4,121 testing images (no training images).
5. **DUTS**: Contains 10,553 training images and 5,019 testing images.
6. **DUT-OMRON**: Contains 5,168 testing images (no training images).
7. **HKU-IS**: Contains 4,447 testing images (no training images).
8. **ECSSD**: Contains 1,000 testing images (no training images).
9. **PASCAL-S**: Contains 850 testing images (no training images).

After identifying these datasets, I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
