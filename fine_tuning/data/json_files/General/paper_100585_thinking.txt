To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TR-BERT: Dynamic Token Reduction for Accelerating BERT Inference" by Deming Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several downstream NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, specifically **subsection 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention a total of **eleven NLP benchmarks**, which include both question-answering datasets and text classification datasets.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **SQuAD 2.0**: A large-scale reading comprehension dataset that includes unanswerable questions.
2. **NewsQA**: A dataset integrated into the MRQA benchmark for reading comprehension.
3. **NaturalQA**: Another reading comprehension dataset from the MRQA benchmark.
4. **RACE**: A dataset composed of multiple-choice questions from English examinations.
5. **HotpotQA**: An extractive question-answering dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning.
6. **TriviaQA**: A dataset with question-answer pairs sourced from Wikipedia.
7. **WikiHop**: A dataset that requires multi-hop reasoning chains for answering questions.
8. **YELP.F**: A dataset containing reviews from the Yelp Dataset Challenge.
9. **20NewsGroups**: A dataset comprising newsgroup posts across 20 topics.
10. **IMDB**: A dataset of movie reviews annotated as positive or negative.
11. **Hyperpartisan**: A dataset aimed at detecting hyperpartisan news articles.

After identifying these datasets, I will then look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
