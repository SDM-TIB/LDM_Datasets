To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Attentions Help CNNs See Better: Attention-based Hybrid Image Quality Assessment Network" by Shanshan Lao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their model on **four standard IQA datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically provide a comprehensive list of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **LIVE Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for image quality assessment and contains 29 reference images with 779 distorted images. The distortion types are traditional, and the quality ratings are based on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS).

2. **CSIQ Dataset**: The CSIQ dataset includes 30 reference images and 866 distorted images, also with traditional distortion types and MOS ratings.

3. **TID2013 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 25 reference images and 3,000 distorted images, again with traditional distortion types and MOS ratings.

4. **PIPAL Dataset**: The PIPAL dataset is noted for including a large number of distorted images, including those generated by GANs. It contains 250 reference images and 29,000 distorted images, with MOS ratings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **LIVE Dataset**:
  > Hamid R. Sheikh, Muhammad F. Sabir, and Alan C. Bovik. *A statistical evaluation of recent full reference image quality assessment algorithms*. IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 2006.

- For the **CSIQ Dataset**:
  > Eric Cooper Larson and Damon Michael Chandler. *Most apparent distortion: full-reference image quality assessment and the role of strategy*. Journal of Electronic Imaging, 2010.

- For the **TID2013 Dataset**:
  > Nikolay Ponomarenko et al. *Image database TID2013: Peculiarities, results and perspectives*. Signal Processing: Image Communication, 2015.

- For the **PIPAL Dataset**:
  > Jinjin Gu et al. *PIPAL: A large-scale image quality assessment dataset for perceptual image restoration*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
