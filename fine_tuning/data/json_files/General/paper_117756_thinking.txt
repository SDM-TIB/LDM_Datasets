To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal and Independent: Multilingual Probing Framework for Exhaustive Model Interpretation and Evaluation" by Oleg Serikov et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a framework for probing a large number of languages and morphosyntactic features, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Framework Design)**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. They mention using the **Universal Dependencies (UD) data** as a source of multilingual data with validated and standardized morphological and syntactic annotations. This is a key dataset for their probing experiments.

In **section 3.2 (Multilingual Data)**, the authors specify that they utilized data from **289 repositories, including data from 172 languages** available in the Universal Dependencies, updated in May 2022. They filtered this data to include **104 languages** for their experiments, resulting in **1927 probing tasks**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Universal Dependencies dataset. The citation is:

- **Universal Dependencies**:
  > Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Christopher D. Manning, Joakim Nivre, and Daniel Zeman. *Universal Dependencies*. Computational Linguistics, 47(2):255â€“308, 2021.

Additionally, I will note that the authors mention the use of various probing tasks based on the Universal Dependencies data, but they do not provide separate citations for each probing task since they are derived from the same source.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
