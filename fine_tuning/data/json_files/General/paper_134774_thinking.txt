To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Assessing Logical Puzzle Solving in Large Language Models: Insights from a Minesweeper Case Study" by Yinghao Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract introduces a novel task involving Minesweeper, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to this task.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that discuss the experimental setup. Here, the authors mention generating **1,000 randomly arranged Minesweeper boards**, which indicates that they created a dataset specifically for their experiments. I will note the details about this dataset, including its structure and purpose.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to additional datasets or benchmarks that were used for comparison or evaluation. The authors discuss the performance of various models on the Minesweeper task, but I need to ensure that I capture any datasets that were utilized for training or evaluation purposes.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, if the authors refer to existing datasets or benchmarks, I will ensure to document their citations accurately.

Based on my findings, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset identified in the paper.
