To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Large Scale Real-Time GNN Inference using Channel Pruning" by Hongkuan Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on five popular datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they list the following datasets:

1. **Flickr**: This dataset is used for classifying types of user-uploaded images. It contains 899,756 nodes and 7,977,410 edges, with 7 classes and a test percentage of 25%.

2. **Arxiv**: This dataset is used for classifying subject areas of Arxiv CS papers. It consists of 1,166,243 nodes and 11,606,919 edges, with 40 classes and a test percentage of 29%.

3. **Reddit**: This dataset is used for classifying communities of Reddit posts. It has 500 nodes and 2,449,029 edges, with 41 classes and a test percentage of 24%.

4. **Yelp**: This dataset is used for classifying types of businesses on Yelp. It contains 89,250 nodes and 61,859,140 edges, with 300 classes and a test percentage of 10%.

5. **Products**: This dataset is used for classifying categories of products on Amazon. It has 232,965 nodes and 11,606,919 edges, with 100 classes and a test percentage of 88%.

Additionally, the authors mention the **YelpCHI dataset**, which is used for a real-time spam detection application. This dataset has 67,395 nodes and 287,619 edges, with 2 classes and a test percentage of 25%.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described with its full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
