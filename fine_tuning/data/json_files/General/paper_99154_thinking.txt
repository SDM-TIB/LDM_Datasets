To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Permutation-Invariant Subgraph Discovery" by Raghvendra Mall et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the introduction of a new problem formulation and mentions an extensive case study on comparative gene regulatory networks (GRNs). This suggests that datasets related to gene regulatory networks may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **experiments**, **data**, or **methodology**. In the **Experiments & Analysis** section, the authors describe their evaluation on several synthetic and real-world datasets. They mention using randomized Scale-Free (SF) graphs and Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, which are generated for their experiments.

I will note the following datasets mentioned:

1. **C. Elegans Network**: This dataset consists of neuronal connectivity networks of two roundworms, with a common set of 202 neurons and different numbers of edges (2870 and 3090). The authors reference the original work by White et al. (1986) for this dataset.

2. **Glioma Cancer Data**: This dataset is obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and includes networks corresponding to IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype subtypes of glioma, comprising 12,985 genes. The authors cite Johnson et al. (2007) for this dataset.

In the **References** section, I will find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **C. Elegans Network**, the citation is:
  > White, J. G., Southgate, E., Thomson, J. N., & Brenner, S. (1986). The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences*, 314(1165), 1-340.

- For the **Glioma Cancer Data**, the citation is:
  > Johnson, W. E., Li, C., & Rabinovic, A. (2007). Adjusting batch effects in microarray expression data using empirical Bayes methods. *Biostatistics*, 8(1), 118-127.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
