To extract datasets from the research paper titled "JuICe: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Dataset for Open Domain Context-based Code Generation" by Rajas Agashe, Srinivasan Iyer, and Luke Zettlemoyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset collection sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present a corpus called **JuICe**, which consists of 1.5 million examples and a curated test set of 3.7K instances. This suggests that JuICe is a significant dataset that I need to describe.

Next, I will look for specific details about the JuICe dataset in the **dataset collection section**. The authors explain that JuICe is created from over 659K publicly available Jupyter notebooks, which are filtered for notebooks containing natural language (NL) markdown in English and Python code. They also mention that the dataset includes a training set of 1.5 million examples and a human-curated dev/test set of 3,725 NL statements.

In the **experiments section**, the authors discuss how they evaluate models using the JuICe dataset for two tasks: generating API call sequences and full code cell generation. This reinforces the importance of the JuICe dataset in their research.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the JuICe dataset from the **References section**. The citation for the JuICe dataset is:
> Rajas Agashe, Srinivasan Iyer, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *JuICe: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Dataset for Open Domain Context-based Code Generation*. In Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-12, 2021.

Finally, I will compile the information about the JuICe dataset, including its description and citation, into a structured format that is ready for further processing or review.
