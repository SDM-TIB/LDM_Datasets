To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Contrastive Learning for Domain Adaptation" by Junjie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of their method on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets, but I need to confirm their names and details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention conducting experiments on several tasks, including Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA). They specifically mention datasets such as:

1. **SYNTHIA**: Used for UDA Semantic Segmentation. The authors report performance metrics on this dataset, indicating its significance in their experiments.

2. **GTA5**: Another dataset used for UDA Semantic Segmentation, with performance results provided.

3. **DomainNet**: Mentioned in the context of SSDA tasks, indicating that it is also a dataset used in their experiments.

4. **Office-Home**: This dataset is referenced for UDA tasks, further confirming its use in their evaluations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **SYNTHIA**:
  > German Ros, Laura Sellart, Joanna Materzynska, David Vazquez, and Antonio M Lopez. *The SYNTHIA Dataset: A Large Collection of Synthetic Images for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes*. In CVPR, pages 3234â€“3243, 2016.

- For **GTA5**:
  > M. Johnson-Roberson, Charles Barto, Rounak Mehta, Sharath Nittur Sridhar, Karl Rosaen, and Ram Vasudevan. *Driving in the Matrix: Can Virtual Worlds Replace Human-Generated Annotations for Real World Tasks?* In ICRA, 2017.

- For **DomainNet**:
  > Xingchao Peng, Qinxun Bai, Xide Xia, Zijun Huang, Kate Saenko, and Bo Wang. *Moment Matching for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation*. In ICCV, 2019.

- For **Office-Home**:
  > Hemanth Venkateswara, Jose Eusebio, and Sethuraman Panchanathan. *A Hashing Network for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation*. In CVPR, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
