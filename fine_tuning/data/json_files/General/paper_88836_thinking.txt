To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Modality-Balanced Models for Visual Dialogue" by Hyounghun Kim, Hao Tan, and Mohit Bansal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the Visual Dialog task and indicates that the authors conducted experiments using a specific dataset. This suggests that there is a dataset involved, which I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention using the **VisDial v1.0 dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and any relevant statistics.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors describe the VisDial v1.0 dataset in detail, stating that it consists of images, captions, question-answer pairs, and how it is split into training, validation, and test sets. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VisDial v1.0 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Das, A., Kottur, S., Gupta, K., Singh, A., Yadav, D., Moura, J. M., Parikh, D., & Batra, D. (2017). Visual Dialog. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **VisDial v1.0**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating models on the Visual Dialog task. It contains images, captions, and multiple rounds of question-answer pairs, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of dialogue models in a visual context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.
