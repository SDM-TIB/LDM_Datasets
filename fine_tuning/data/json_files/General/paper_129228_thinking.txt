To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Act3D: 3D Feature Field Transformers for Multi-Task Robotic Manipulation" by Theophile Gervet et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that Act3D sets a new state-of-the-art in **RLBench**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors describe their evaluation settings. In **section 4.1 (Evaluation in simulation)**, they explicitly mention using **RLBench** for testing Act3D in both single-task and multi-task settings. They describe the tasks and variations included in the dataset, which indicates that RLBench is a significant dataset for their research.

I will also check the **related work and references sections** to see if any other datasets are mentioned. In the related work, they discuss various methods and benchmarks, but the primary dataset they focus on for their experiments is RLBench.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the **RLBench** dataset from the references section. The citation is as follows:
> James, S., Ma, Z., Arrojo, D. R., & Davison, A. J. (2020). RLBench: The Robot Learning Benchmark & Learning Environment. *IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters*, 5(2), 3019â€“3026.

Since RLBench is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the context of their experiments, I will summarize it as follows:

1. **RLBench**: An established benchmark for learning diverse robot manipulation policies from demonstrations. It includes 74 tasks grouped into 9 categories for single-task evaluation and 18 tasks with 249 variations for multi-task evaluation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset and its citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured the necessary details for future reference or processing.
