To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "CUCL: Codebook for Unsupervised Continual Learning" by Cheng Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the study involves conducting extensive experiments on **CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and MiniImageNet benchmark datasets**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about each dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 100 classes, with each class containing 500 training samples and 100 testing samples. The authors mention that they constructed a split version of CIFAR100 by randomly dividing the classes into 10 tasks.

2. **TinyImageNet**: This is a variant of the ImageNet dataset, comprising 10 randomized classes out of the 100 classes for each task. The images are resized to 64 x 64 pixels.

3. **MiniImageNet**: This dataset is created by dividing the 100 classes of the ImageNet into 10 sequential tasks, with each class containing 500 training samples and 100 testing samples. Each image in this dataset has a size of 84 x 84 pixels.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

- For **MiniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Tim Lillicrap, Koray Kavukcuoglu, and Daan Wierstra. *Matching Networks for One Shot Learning*. In NeurIPS, 2016.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that they are accurately represented for any further processing or review.
