To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Gradient-based Bilevel Optimization Approach for Tuning Hyperparameters in Machine Learning" by Ankur Sinha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors performed extensive computational studies on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They mention two datasets used for their computational studies:

1. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: This dataset contains 122 independent variables and 1 dependent variable, with a total of 1994 data points. The authors specify that they used 55% of the data for training, 20% for validation, and 25% for testing.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification. The authors created three subsets of the MNIST dataset, each consisting of different numbers of data points (1000, 5000, and 10000). They also mention that they performed experiments with single and dual hyperparameters.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Communities and Crime Dataset**, the citation is:
  > UCI Machine Learning Repository: Communities and Crime Data Set. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime. Accessed: 2020-05-1.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST Handwritten Digit Database*. 2010.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Communities and Crime Dataset**: A dataset with 122 independent variables and 1 dependent variable, containing 1994 data points, used for ridge regression.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset for handwritten digit classification, with subsets of 1000, 5000, and 10000 data points, used for multi-class classification experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented.
