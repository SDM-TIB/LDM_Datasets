To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretation of High-Dimensional Linear Regression: Effects of Nullspace and Regularization Demonstrated on Battery Data," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and case studies** sections to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that the study involves "lithium-ion battery data" and that the insights gained are demonstrated on this dataset. This indicates that there is at least one dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies section** (section 4), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. They specifically mention two types of data:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset is generated for the purpose of testing the nullspace method. The authors describe how the data is created, including the dimensions and characteristics, but they do not provide a formal citation since it is synthetic.

2. **Lithium-Ion Battery Data**: The authors refer to a specific dataset related to Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries, which contains cycling data for 124 batteries. They mention that this dataset is used to predict the cycle life of the batteries. The authors also provide a reference to the original paper that introduced this dataset.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citation of the dataset related to the lithium-ion batteries. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Lithium-Ion Battery Data**, the citation is:
  > K. A. Severson, P. M. Attia, N. Jin, N. Perkins, B. Jiang, et al. "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation." *Nature Energy*, vol. 4, no. 5, pp. 383â€“391, 2019. DOI: 10.1038/s41560-019-0320-5.

Since the synthetic dataset does not have a formal citation, I will note that it is a generated dataset for the purpose of the study.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the lithium-ion battery dataset while noting the synthetic dataset's nature.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that the citation for the lithium-ion battery dataset is accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
