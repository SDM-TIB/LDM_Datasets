To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing Disparity Between Edge Models and High-Accuracy Base Models for Vision Tasks" by Zhenyu Wang and Shahriar Nirjon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted a comprehensive evaluation using "over 1.2 million images and 24 models," which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Dataset-Driven Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1K**: This dataset contains 1,431,167 images and is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 images across 10 classes, commonly used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

3. **MIT Indoor Scenes**: This dataset is used for indoor scene recognition, although the exact number of images is not specified in the text.

4. **COCO**: The Common Objects in Context dataset, which is used for object detection and segmentation tasks, though specific details about the number of images are not provided.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were utilized for evaluating their proposed method, XDELTA, which further validates their inclusion.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet-1K**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky, G. Hinton, et al. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **MIT Indoor Scenes**, the citation is:
  > A. Quattoni and A. Torralba. *Recognizing Indoor Scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Doll√°r, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
