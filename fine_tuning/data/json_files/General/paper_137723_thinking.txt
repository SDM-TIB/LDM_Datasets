To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3DMASC: Accessible, Explainable 3D Point Clouds Classification. Application to Bi-Spectral Topo-Bathymetric LiDAR Data" by Mathilde Letard et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors present two labeled topo-bathymetric lidar datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors describe the two datasets used for evaluation: one from a coastal environment and another from a fluvial environment. They mention that both datasets were surveyed with a Teledyne-Optech Titan airborne lidar with two wavelengths (532 nm and 1064 nm).

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets are available on https://opentopography.org/, which is a key detail for accessing the datasets.

The datasets are:
1. **Coastal Dataset**: Collected from the French coast of the Channel, near FrÃ©hel. This dataset includes various land and water classes.
2. **Fluvial Dataset**: Collected from the Ain River in South-Eastern France, which includes different classes of riverine environments.

Now, I will compile the full citations for these datasets based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references that may be cited.

- For the **Coastal Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Fluvial Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lague, D., Feldmann, B. (2020). Topo-bathymetric airborne LiDAR for fluvial-geomorphology analysis. In: Tarolli, P., Mudd, S.M. (Eds.), Developments in Earth Surface Processes, Remote Sensing of Geomorphology. Elsevier, pp. 25-54. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-64177-9.00002-3

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference.
