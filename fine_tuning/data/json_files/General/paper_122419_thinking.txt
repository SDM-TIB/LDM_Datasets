To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A model-free feature selection technique of feature screening and random forest based recursive feature elimination" by Siwei Xia and Yuehan Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a model-free feature selection method but does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Simulations)** and **section 5 (Application)**, as these sections often contain information about datasets used for experiments or simulations. In section 5, the authors mention the **Tecator dataset**, which is gathered using the Near Infrared Transmission principle. This dataset consists of 240 samples and 100 predictors of absorbance channel spectra, with the response being the proportion of fat in meat.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Tecator dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Tecator dataset. Available at: http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/tecator.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Tecator Dataset**: This dataset is used in the application section to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. It includes 240 samples and 100 predictors related to the fat content in meat.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry for the Tecator dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be the only dataset extracted from this paper.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or processing.
