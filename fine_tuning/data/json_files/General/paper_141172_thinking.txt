To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "GPFL: A Gradient Projection-Based Client Selection Framework for Efficient Federated Learning" by Shijie Na et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. In the abstract, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **FEMNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into the **introduction** section to see if there are any additional details about these datasets. The introduction provides context for the research but does not introduce new datasets.

In the **experiments section**, specifically in **section V (Experiment Settings)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention:

1. **FEMNIST**: This dataset is based on the Extended MNIST dataset and is specifically crafted for federated learning research. It includes handwritten digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z, a-z) and is part of the LEAF benchmark suite.

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks.

The authors also provide statistics about the datasets, including the number of clients and samples, which further confirms their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **FEMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Caldas, S., Duddu, S. M. K., Wu, P., Li, T., Konečný, J., McMahan, H. B., Smith, V., & Talwalkar, A. (2018). *Leaf: A benchmark for federated settings*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.01097.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
