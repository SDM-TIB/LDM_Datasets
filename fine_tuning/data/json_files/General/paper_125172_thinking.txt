To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Black Box Variational Inference with a Deterministic Objective: Faster, More Accurate, and Even More Black Box" by Ryan Giordano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on a variety of real-world problems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experiments and mention several models and datasets used for evaluation. They specifically list:

1. **ARM Dataset**: This dataset consists of 53 models and datasets taken from a hierarchical-modeling textbook by Gelman and Hill (2006). The models vary in complexity and parameter dimensions.

2. **Microcredit Dataset**: A hierarchical model from development economics that performs shrinkage on seven randomized controlled trials.

3. **Occupancy Dataset**: A multi-species occupancy model from ecology, which includes data from 1387 sites and 32 different species.

4. **Tennis Dataset**: A dataset comprising all men’s professional tennis matches on the ATP tour since 1969, with a total of 164,936 matches.

5. **POTUS Dataset**: A time series polling model for the US presidential election, which is complex and high-dimensional.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration.

The citations I will extract are:

- For the **ARM Dataset**:
  > Gelman, A., & Hill, J. (2006). *Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models*. Cambridge University Press.

- For the **Microcredit Dataset**:
  > Meager, R. (2019). Understanding the Average Impact of Microcredit Expansions: A Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis of Seven Randomized Experiments. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 11(1), 57–91.

- For the **Occupancy Dataset**:
  > Ingram, M., Vukcevic, D., & Golding, N. (2022). Scaling multi-species occupancy detection models to large citizen science datasets. *In preparation*.

- For the **Tennis Dataset**:
  > No specific citation is provided in the paper, but it refers to data from ATP tour matches since 1969.

- For the **POTUS Dataset**:
  > Heidemanns, M., Gelman, A., & Morris, G. (2020). An Updated Dynamic Bayesian Forecasting Model for the US Presidential Election. *Harvard Data Science Review*, 2(4).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
