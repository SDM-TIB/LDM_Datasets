To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Natural Response Generation for Chinese Reading Comprehension" by Nuo Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the construction of a new dataset called **Penguin**, which is specifically designed for natural response generation in Chinese machine reading comprehension (MRC). This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into the **Datasets section** (Section 3) of the paper, where the authors provide detailed information about the **Penguin** dataset. They describe it as containing 200k training data and a 15k test corpus, emphasizing its focus on high-quality, fluent, and informative responses. This section is crucial as it provides specifics about the dataset's size and purpose.

In addition to **Penguin**, the authors compare it with several existing datasets in Table 2, which lists other MRC datasets such as **SQuAD**, **RACE**, **MarCO**, **DuReader**, **CMRC 2018**, and **ReCo**. I will need to extract the names and relevant details of these datasets as well.

For each dataset mentioned, I will gather the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**.
2. **Language** (e.g., English or Chinese).
3. **Answer type** (e.g., span extraction, multiple choice, free-form).
4. **Size** (number of examples).

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is essential for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The citations I will look for include:
- For **Penguin**, since it is a new dataset introduced in this paper, I will cite the paper itself.
- For **SQuAD**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Jian Zhang, Konstantin Lopyrev, and Percy Liang. *SQuAD: 100,000+ questions for machine comprehension of text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2383–2392, 2016.
  
- For **RACE**, the citation is:
  > Guokun Lai, Qizhe Xie, Hanxiao Liu, Yiming Yang, and Eduard Hovy. *RACE: Large-scale reading comprehension dataset from examinations*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 796–805, 2017.

- For **MarCO**, the citation is:
  > Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, and Li Deng. *MS MARCO: A human generated machine reading comprehension dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.09268, 2016.

- For **DuReader**, the citation is:
  > Wei He, Kai Liu, Yajuan Lyu, Shiqi Zhao, Xinyan Xiao, Yuan Liu, Yizhong Wang, Hua Wu, Qiaoqiao She, Xuan Liu, et al. *DuReader: A Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset from real-world applications*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05073, 2017.

- For **CMRC 2018**, the citation is:
  > Yiming Cui, Ting Liu, Wanxiang Che, Li Xiao, Zhipeng Chen, Wentao Ma, Shijin Wang, and Guoping Hu. *A span-extraction dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension*. In EMNLP/IJCNLP (1), pages 5882–5888, 2019.

- For **ReCo**, the citation is:
  > Bingning Wang, Ting Yao, Qi Zhang, Jingfang Xu, and Xiaochuan Wang. *ReCo: A large scale Chinese reading comprehension dataset on opinion*. In The Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2020, pages 9146–9153, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future reference.
