To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Find the dimension that counts: Fast dimension estimation and Krylov PCA" by Shashanka Ubaru, Abd-Krim Seghouane, and Yousef Saad, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant parameters.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several datasets used for numerical experiments, including:

1. **Harvard Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed method. It has a size of 5000 and an actual rank of 63.
2. **lpiceria3d Dataset**: Another dataset used in the experiments, with a size of 10000 and an actual rank of 100.
3. **EVA Dataset**: This dataset has a size of 40000 and an actual rank of 100.
4. **lpstocfor3 Dataset**: This dataset has a size of 16675 and an actual rank of 981.
5. **as-22july Dataset**: This dataset has a size of 500 and an actual rank that is not specified.
6. **internet Dataset**: This dataset has a size of 124651, but the actual rank is also not specified.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. However, since the datasets are likely to be publicly available datasets or synthetic datasets generated for the experiments, they may not have formal citations. In such cases, I will note that the datasets are commonly used in the literature or provide a brief description of their source if available.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective details, including any relevant citations or descriptions, into a structured format for further processing.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Identify datasets and their characteristics.
4. Check the references for any formal citations.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for review.

This systematic approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
