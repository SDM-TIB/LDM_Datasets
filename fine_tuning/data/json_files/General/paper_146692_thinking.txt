To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probability of Differentiation Reveals Brittleness of Homogeneity Bias in Large Language Models" by Messi H.J. Lee and Calvin K. Lai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **Name-Trait Perceptions dataset**, which is a clear indication that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, specifically **section 2.1 (Name Selection)**, where the authors describe the **Name-Trait Perceptions dataset** in detail. This dataset comprises 1,000 common American first names rated with respect to group identities (race/ethnicity and gender) and traits. This section provides essential information about the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Name-Trait Perceptions dataset**. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Elder, E. M., & Hayes, M. (2023). Signaling Race, Ethnicity, and Gender with Names: Challenges and Recommendations. *The Journal of Politics*, 85(2), 764â€“770.

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. However, the primary dataset discussed is the **Name-Trait Perceptions dataset**. 

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and methods sections to identify datasets.
2. Focusing on the Name-Trait Perceptions dataset in section 2.1.
3. Retrieving the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the **Name-Trait Perceptions dataset**.
