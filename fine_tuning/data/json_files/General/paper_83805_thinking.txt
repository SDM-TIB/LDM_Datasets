To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepCaps: Going Deeper with Capsule Networks" by Jathushan Rajasegaran et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors reference achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention that they evaluate their model on datasets like **CIFAR10**, **SVHN**, and **Fashion-MNIST**. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be discussed in detail later.

I will then navigate to the **experiments and results section** (Section 5). In this section, the authors explicitly state that they tested their model on **CIFAR10**, **SVHN**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **MNIST**. They provide performance metrics for each dataset, confirming their use in the experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets:

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech Report, 2009.

2. **SVHN**: The citation is:
   > Y. Netzer, T. Wang, A. Coates, A. Bissacco, B. Wu, and A. Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In NIPS, Granada, Spain, 2011.

3. **Fashion-MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. CoRR, 2017.

4. **MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
