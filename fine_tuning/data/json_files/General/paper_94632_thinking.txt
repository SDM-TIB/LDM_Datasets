To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DoubleEnsemble: A New Ensemble Method Based on Sample Reweighting and Feature Selection for Financial Data Analysis" by Chuheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to specific datasets used for financial market prediction.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets utilized. In this paper, they mention applying their model to two financial markets: **OKEx (a cryptocurrency exchange)** and **China’s A-share market**. I will look for specific details about the datasets used in these experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide information about the datasets:
1. **OKEx Dataset**: This dataset consists of market snapshots for four trading pairs (ETC/BTC, ETH/BTC, GAS/BTC, and LTC/BTC) captured approximately every 0.3 seconds over 10 consecutive trading days, totaling 3 million training samples and 1.5 million testing samples. The features are based on microstructure information of the market.

2. **China’s A-share Market Dataset**: This dataset includes trading data for over 3,000 stocks, with each sample corresponding to one trading day of a stock. The experiments are conducted over a period from January 2017 to November 2019, using 182 features calculated before market closing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to these datasets. However, since the datasets are derived from specific financial markets and not from previously published datasets, I will note that the datasets are original to this study and do not have external citations.

Now, I will summarize the datasets extracted:
- For the **OKEx Dataset**, I will note the details about the trading pairs, the number of samples, and the features used.
- For the **China’s A-share Market Dataset**, I will summarize the number of stocks, the time period, and the features utilized.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the datasets, ensuring to include all relevant details for each dataset as described in the paper.
