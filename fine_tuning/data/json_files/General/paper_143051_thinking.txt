To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision Mamba: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy" by Xiao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss experiments or applications** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, which may include mentions of datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any explicit mentions of datasets. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets that are foundational to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In this paper, it is likely that there will be a section that details the datasets used for various tasks, including any specific characteristics or statistics about these datasets.

As I read through the relevant sections, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and the specific tasks they are used for.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "ImageNet," I would look for its citation in the references, which might include details such as the authors, title, conference or journal, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
