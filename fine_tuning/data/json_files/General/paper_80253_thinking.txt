To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What makes for effective detection proposals?" by Jan Hosang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on detection proposals and mentions evaluations on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors often describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets like PASCAL VOC, ImageNet, and MS COCO, as these are commonly used in object detection research.

Upon finding the datasets, I will extract the relevant details for each one, including:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any notable characteristics (e.g., number of images, categories).
3. **Full Citation**: The complete citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions the **PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset**, I will note that it is a widely used dataset for object detection tasks, containing images across 20 object categories. The citation for this dataset is:
> M. Everingham, S. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. "The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge â€“ A Retrospective." *International Journal of Computer Vision*, vol. 111, no. 1, pp. 98-136, 2015.

Similarly, I will look for citations for **ImageNet** and **MS COCO** datasets, ensuring that I capture the necessary details for each.

After gathering all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important datasets mentioned in the paper and that I provide accurate citations for each one.
