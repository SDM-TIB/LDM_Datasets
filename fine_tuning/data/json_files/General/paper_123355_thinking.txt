To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Testing the Channels of Convolutional Neural Networks" by Kang Choi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluated their techniques using **five public datasets**, which indicates that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section (Section 7)**, where the authors describe their experiments. They explicitly list the datasets used for testing their methods. In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the datasets and the corresponding models used for evaluation:

1. **MNIST/SVHN**: Used for digit recognition with models LeNet and AlexNet.
2. **VGG Face**: Used for face identification with models VGG-16 and ResNet-50.
3. **CelebA**: Used for face attribute detection with the AlexNet model.
4. **CARLA**: Used for autonomous driving with the CARLA-CNN model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2011.

- For **VGG Face**, the citation is:
  > Omkar M Parkhi, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman. *Deep Face Recognition*. In Proceedings of the British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2015.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **CARLA**, the citation is:
  > Francisco Codevilla, Matthias Müller, Antonio López, Vladlen Koltun, and Alexey Dosovitskiy. *End-to-End Driving via Conditional Imitation Learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2018.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
