To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated Data Visualization from Natural Language via Large Language Models: An Exploratory Study" by Yang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on the NL2Vis task and mentions the use of benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation Setup)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **nvBench dataset**, which is crucial for their evaluation of the NL2Vis task. The authors describe it as encompassing 780 relational tables sourced from 153 databases across 105 diverse domains, featuring 7,247 visualizations and resulting in 25,750 pairs of natural-language descriptions and corresponding visualizations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the nvBench dataset. The authors reference the original paper that introduced this dataset, which is:

- For **nvBench**, the citation is:
  > Yuyu Luo, Jiawei Tang, and Guoliang Li. *nvBench: A large-scale synthesized dataset for cross-domain natural language to visualization task*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.12926, 2021.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for nvBench, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in a structured format, ready for further processing or review.
