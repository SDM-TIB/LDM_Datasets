To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Colorization as a Proxy Task for Visual Understanding" by Gustav Larsson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their self-supervised network on several tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Training)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention training on **3.7 million unlabeled images**, combining **1.3 million from ImageNet** and **2.4 million from Places205**. This is a clear indication of datasets being utilized.

In **section 5 (Results)**, the authors present results on two established benchmarks: **PASCAL VOC 2007** for classification and **PASCAL VOC 2012** for segmentation. This confirms that these datasets are part of their evaluation.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: The citation is:
   > O. Russakovsky, J. Deng, H. Su, J. Krause, S. Satheesh, S. Ma, Z. Huang, A. Karpathy, A. Khosla, M. Bernstein, A. C. Berg, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3), 2015.

2. **Places205**: The citation is:
   > B. Zhou, A. Lapedriza, J. Xiao, A. Torralba, and A. Oliva. *Learning deep features for scene recognition using places database*. In NIPS, pages 487â€“495, 2014.

3. **PASCAL VOC 2007**: The citation is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 88(2), 2010.

4. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: The citation is:
   > J. Long, E. Shelhamer, and T. Darrell. *Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation*. In CVPR, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
