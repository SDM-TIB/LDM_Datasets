To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Let’s Rectify Step by Step: Improving Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis with Diffusion Models" by Shunyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that empirical evaluations were conducted on **eight benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two versions of datasets, D20a and D20b, which contain restaurant and laptop reviews. 

In this section, I will extract the following datasets:

1. **D20a**: This dataset includes two versions:
   - **D20a (Restaurant Reviews)**: Contains 1300 training, 2145 development, and 920 test sentences.
   - **D20b (Laptop Reviews)**: Contains 1265 training, 593 development, and 923 test sentences.

2. **D20b**: This dataset also has two versions:
   - **D20b (Restaurant Reviews)**: Contains 1266 training, 2338 development, and 906 test sentences.
   - **D20b (Laptop Reviews)**: Contains 1460 training, 605 development, and 1013 test sentences.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are typically provided in the context of the original papers that introduced these datasets.

For **D20a**, the citation is:
> Peng, H., Xu, L., Bing, L., Huang, F., Lu, W., & Si, L. (2020). Knowing what, how and why: A near complete solution for aspect-based sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the Thirty-Fourth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI 2020, pages 8600–8607.

For **D20b**, the citation is:
> Xu, L., Li, W., Lu, W., & Bing, L. (2020). Position-aware tagging for aspect triplet extraction. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.02609.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
