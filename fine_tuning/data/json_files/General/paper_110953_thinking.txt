To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Using virtual edges to extract keywords from texts modeled as complex networks" by Jorge A. V. Tohalino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **Section III (Material and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets utilized in their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Hult-2003 Dataset**: This dataset consists of title, keywords, and abstracts from scientific papers published between 1998 and 2002. It contains 500 abstracts with an average size of about 123 words.

2. **Marujo-2012 Dataset**: This dataset comprises 450 web news stories covering various subjects such as business, culture, sport, and technology. The average document size is 452 words.

3. **SemEval-2010 Dataset**: This dataset includes full content from 100 scientific papers extracted from the ACM Digital Library, along with their corresponding keywords assigned by both authors and readers. The average document length is 8,168 words.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Hult-2003 Dataset**:
  > Hulth, A. (2003). Improved automatic keyword extraction given more linguistic knowledge. In Proceedings of the 2003 conference on Empirical methods in natural language processing (pp. 216–223).

- For the **Marujo-2012 Dataset**:
  > Marujo, L., Gershman, A., Carbonell, J., Frederking, R., & Neto, J. (2012). Supervised topical key phrase extraction of news stories using crowdsourcing, light filtering and co-reference normalization. In Proceedings of the 2012 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (pp. 399–403).

- For the **SemEval-2010 Dataset**:

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this data into a structured format for further processing or review.
