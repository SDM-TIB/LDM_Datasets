To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Frog-Snake Prey-Predation Relationship Optimization (FSRO)" by Hayata Saitou and Harumi Haraguchi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed algorithm conducts computational experiments on feature selection using **26 types of machine learning datasets**. This indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **experimental results** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention that the algorithm was tested on datasets from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and the **ASU Feature Selection Repository**. This is a good lead, but I need to find the exact datasets used.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors provide a table (Table 3) that lists the datasets used in their experiments. The datasets are categorized into small and large datasets, and they include:

1. **Breast-cancer**
2. **Congress**
3. **Ionosphere**
4. **Sonar**
5. **Statlog (Heart)**
6. **Wine**
7. **Zoo**
8. **Waveform**
9. **SPECT Heart**
10. **Lymphography**
11. **Tic-Tac-Toe**
12. **Exactly**
13. **Exactly2**
14. **M-of-n**
15. **KrVsKp**
16. **Vote**
17. **musk-1**
18. **Penglung**
19. **SCADI**
20. **landcover**
21. **Yale**
22. **Colon**
23. **Prostate_GE**
24. **leukemia**
25. **orlraws10P**
26. **CLL_SUB_111**

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper references two repositories:

- For the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, the citation is:
  > David Aha, UCI Machine Learning Repository, “https://archive.ics.uci.edu/”

- For the **ASU Feature Selection Repository**, the citation is:
  > Jundong Li, Kewei Cheng, Kaize Ding, Faisal Alatawi, Huan Liu. ASU Feature Selection Repository, "https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html"

With this information, I can now compile the datasets and their citations into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have identified the datasets used in the experiments and their sources, which are crucial for understanding the context and applicability of the proposed algorithm.
