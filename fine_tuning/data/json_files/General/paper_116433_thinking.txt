To extract datasets from the research paper titled "YATO: Yet Another deep learning based Text analysis Open toolkit" by Zeqiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the toolkit and its capabilities, but it does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the context of the research and mentions various models and frameworks but does not explicitly list datasets either.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 5**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 5.1 (Datasets and Main Results)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they evaluated their framework on. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **CoNLL2003**: This dataset is used for named entity recognition (NER) tasks.
2. **OntoNotes**: Another dataset for NER tasks.
3. **MSRA**: A dataset also used for NER tasks.
4. **CCG-Bank**: This dataset is used for CCG supertagging.
5. **SST2**: A dataset for sentiment analysis.
6. **SST5**: Another sentiment analysis dataset.
7. **ChnSentiCorp**: A dataset for sentiment analysis in Chinese.

I will then verify the details of each dataset by checking the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

  > Manish Munikar, Sushil Shakya, and Aakash Shrestha. *Fine-grained sentiment classification using BERT*. In 2019 Artificial Intelligence for Transforming Business and Society (AITB), 2019.

  > Songbo Tan and Jin Zhang. *An empirical study of sentiment analysis for Chinese documents*. Expert Systems with Applications, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
