To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Causal Research Pipeline and Tutorial for Psychologists and Social Scientists" by Matthew J. Vowels, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's objectives and may mention specific datasets used for demonstration purposes. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for sections that explicitly discuss **data collection or datasets**, such as the **methodology or results sections**. In this paper, the author mentions using secondary data acquired from a specific project, which is a strong indication that a dataset is being utilized. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the variables it contains and the sample size.

In the paper, the author refers to a dataset from the "Health and Relationships Project," which includes responses from 403 couples on various psychological and relational variables. I will extract the relevant details about this dataset, including the types of variables measured (e.g., age, gender, relationship satisfaction, distress levels).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. In this case, the dataset is associated with a specific study, and I will format the citation accordingly.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Umberson, D. (2014-2015). *Health and Relationships Project*. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. doi: 10.3886/ICPSR37404.v2.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described, including its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, facilitating further exploration and analysis by other researchers.
