To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Asymptotics: a model to compare federated learning algorithms" by Gary Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to evaluating their predictions on federated versions of the **EMNIST**, **CIFAR-100**, **Shakespeare**, and **Stack Overflow** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors do not have a specific section titled "Datasets," but they do mention the datasets in the context of their experiments. I will note down the details provided for each dataset.

1. **EMNIST**: This dataset is an extension of MNIST to handwritten letters. It is used for character recognition tasks.
   - Citation: Cohen, G., Afshar, S., Tapson, J., & van Schaik, A. (2017). EMNIST: Extending MNIST to handwritten letters. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN).

2. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 100 classes of images, each containing 600 images. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.
   - Citation: Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. Technical report, University of Toronto.

3. **Shakespeare**: This dataset is built using the works of William Shakespeare and is used for next character prediction tasks.
   - Citation: McMahan, H. B., Moore, E., Ramage, D., Hampson, S., & Ag√ºera y Arcas, B. (2017). Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data. In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS).

4. **Stack Overflow**: This dataset consists of questions and answers from the Stack Overflow website, used for next word prediction tasks.
   - Citation: McMahan, H. B., Rush, K., Reneer, M., Garrett, Z., & TensorFlow Federated Team. (2019). TensorFlow federated stack overflow dataset. Retrieved from https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/api_docs/python/tff/simulation/datasets/stackoverflow/load_data.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to compile the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any further analysis or application of the research findings.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for future reference.
