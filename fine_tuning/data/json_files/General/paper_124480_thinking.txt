To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mathematical Challenges in Deep Learning" by Vahid Partovi Nia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and relevant sections** of the paper, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or data usage. The abstract provides a high-level overview, but I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper to find specific datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction** and **background sections**. These sections often outline the context and previous work, which may include references to datasets used in related studies.

I will then examine the **training and inference sections**, as these often detail the data used for model training and evaluation. I will pay special attention to any tables or figures that might summarize datasets or their characteristics.

If the paper discusses any experiments, I will check the **experiments section** for mentions of datasets. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "MNIST," I would look for its citation, which might be:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

If the paper discusses other datasets, I will follow the same process to ensure I capture their full citations accurately.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant details are documented and accessible for future use or analysis.
