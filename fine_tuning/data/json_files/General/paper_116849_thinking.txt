To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TgDLF2.0: Theory-guided deep-learning for electrical load forecasting via Transformer and transfer learning" by Jiaxin Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of a new model for electrical load forecasting, but it does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the importance of accurate electrical load forecasting but do not specify any datasets. I will proceed to the **methodology** section, where they describe their approach in detail.

In **section 3.1 (Data description and experiment setting)**, the authors provide crucial information about the datasets used. They mention that they used electrical load data from **12 districts in Beijing, China**, covering the period from **January 1, 2008, to September 23, 2011**. This section is key as it outlines the specifics of the dataset.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the dataset in the **References section**. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be original data collected from the districts. However, they reference other works that may have used similar datasets or methodologies.

Since the dataset is not published in a separate paper, I will note that the dataset is original and provide a description based on the information given in the paper. The dataset consists of hourly electrical load data and meteorological data, which includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation rate.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Electrical Load Data**: Collected from 12 districts in Beijing, China, from January 1, 2008, to September 23, 2011. The dataset contains 392,256 data points sampled hourly.

2. **Meteorological Data**: Includes temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation rate, which are crucial for load forecasting.

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is original data collected by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity, ensuring to highlight that the dataset is original and provide a brief description of its contents.
