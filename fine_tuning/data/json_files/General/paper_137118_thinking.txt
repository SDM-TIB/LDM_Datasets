To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spikformer V2: Join the High Accuracy Club on ImageNet with an SNN Ticket" by Zhaokun Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **ImageNet**, which suggests that this dataset is likely central to their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their experimental setup and results. They mention using **ImageNet-1K** for image classification, which is a widely recognized dataset in the field.

I will also check the **background and related work section** to see if there are any additional datasets referenced that might have been used for comparison or validation purposes. However, the primary focus appears to be on ImageNet.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
- **ImageNet**: 
  > J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ImageNet dataset, I will create an entry for it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
