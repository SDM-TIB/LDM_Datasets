To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Freya PAGE: First Optimal Time Complexity for Large-Scale Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Heterogeneous Asynchronous Computations" by Alexander Tyurin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Datasets," or "Methodology."** In these sections, the authors usually describe the datasets they used, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

I will pay attention to any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose. If the authors refer to well-known datasets, I will note those names as they may have established citations.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or presentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I comprehensively extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper while maintaining proper academic standards for citation.
