To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multimodal Volume-Aware Detection and Segmentation for Brain Metastases Radiosurgery" by Szu-Yeu Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of manually delineating tumors and the need for automated segmentation. They reference previous works and datasets, such as the **BraTS dataset**, which is commonly used for brain tumor segmentation. This indicates that there may be other datasets mentioned later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the **data subsection**. Here, the authors describe their primary cohort for model training and testing, which consists of **305 patients with 864 brain metastases**. They provide details about the dataset, including how it was collected and the characteristics of the tumors. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and usage.

The authors also mention an **additional batch of test data** from the same institution, containing **36 patients with 96 metastases**. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets:

1. **Primary Cohort Dataset**: This dataset consists of 305 patients with 864 brain metastases, including volume masks delineated by medical professionals. It is used for training and testing the proposed model.

2. **Additional Test Dataset**: This dataset includes 36 patients with 96 metastases, collected to evaluate the model's robustness and generalizability.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference the **BraTS dataset**, which is essential for my documentation. The citation for the BraTS dataset is:

- For **BraTS dataset**:
  > Menze, B.H., Jakab, A., Bauer, S., Kalpathy-Cramer, J., Farahani, K., Kirby, J., Burren, Y., Porz, N., Slotboom, J., Wiest, R., et al. *The multimodal brain tumor image segmentation benchmark (brats)*. IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 34(10), 1993â€“2024, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets with their respective citations:

- **Primary Cohort Dataset**: 305 patients with 864 brain metastases.
- **Additional Test Dataset**: 36 patients with 96 metastases.
- **BraTS Dataset**: A widely used dataset for brain tumor segmentation.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for downstream processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its citation.
