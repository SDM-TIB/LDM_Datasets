To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdvParams: An Active DNN Intellectual Property Protection Technique via Adversarial Perturbation Based Parameter Encryption" by Mingfu Xue et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experimental results on **Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experimental setup section** to confirm the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments using the following datasets:

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of clothing items.

2. **CIFAR-10**: Another popular dataset for image classification, CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.

3. **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for traffic sign recognition and consists of over 50,000 images of traffic signs.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > H. Xiao, K. Rasul, and R. Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, Tech. Rep. 001, 2009.

- For **GTSRB**, the citation is:
  > J. Stallkamp, M. Schlipsing, J. Salmen, and C. Igel. *The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition*. In The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IEEE, 2011, pp. 1453â€“1460.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for clarity and proper attribution.
