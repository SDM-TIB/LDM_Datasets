To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guiding Teacher Forcing with Seer Forcing for Neural Machine Translation" by Yang Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on "two small data sets (Chinese-English and English-Romanian) and two big data sets (Chinese-English and English-German)." This indicates that datasets are indeed present, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, specifically the **5.1.1 Data Preparation** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide details about the datasets, including their sizes and sources:

1. **Chinese-English Dataset**: The training set consists of about 1.25 million sentence pairs from LDC corpora, with specific references to the LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, and LDC2005T06 corpora. The authors also mention using MT02 for validation and MT03, MT04, MT05, MT06, and MT08 for testing.

2. **English-Romanian Dataset**: This dataset is based on the preprocessed version of the WMT16 En-Ro dataset released by Lee et al. (2018), which includes 0.6 million sentence pairs. The authors used news-dev 2016 for validation and news-test 2016 for testing.

3. **Chinese-English Big Dataset**: The training data is from the WMT 2017 Zh-En translation tasks, containing 20.18 million sentence pairs after removing duplicates. The newsdev2017 was used as the development set, and newstest2017 and newstest2019 were used for testing.

4. **English-German Dataset**: This dataset is from WMT2016, consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. The newstest2014 was used as the development set, and newstest2016 and newstest2019 were used for testing.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section of the paper:

- For the **Chinese-English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, LDC2005T06. *Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC)*.

- For the **English-Romanian Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lee, J., Mansimov, E., & Cho, K. (2018). *Deterministic non-autoregressive neural sequence modeling by iterative refinement*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1173â€“1182.

- For the **Chinese-English Big Dataset**, the citation is:
  > WMT 2017. *WMT 2017 Zh-En translation tasks*.

- For the **English-German Dataset**, the citation is:
  > WMT2016. *WMT2016 English-German translation tasks*.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their sources as required by the task.
