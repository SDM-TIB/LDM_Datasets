To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "SAR Image Change Detection Based on Multiscale Capsule Network" by Yunhao Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was validated on **three real SAR datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section III.A (Dataset and Evaluation Criteria)**, the authors provide details about the datasets:

1. **Sulzberger Dataset**: Captured at Sulzberger Ice Shelf by the Envisat satellite on March 11 and 16, 2011. The size of the dataset is 256×256 pixels.

2. **Yellow River I Dataset**: Captured at the Yellow River Estuary by Radarsat-2 in June 2008. The size of this dataset is 257×289 pixels.

3. **Yellow River II Dataset**: Also captured at the Yellow River Estuary by Radarsat-2 in June 2009. The size of this dataset is 306×291 pixels.

The authors mention that geometric corrections have been performed on these datasets and that the ground truth images were manually annotated with expert knowledge. This confirms the datasets' relevance and quality for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets themselves are not directly cited in the references, as they are specific datasets used in the context of the experiments. Therefore, I will note the details provided in the paper without external citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details as outlined in the paper. The full citations for the datasets will not be available since they are not referenced in the literature, but I will document the information as accurately as possible based on the paper's content.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
