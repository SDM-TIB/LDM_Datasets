To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ReenactGAN: Learning to Reenact Faces via Boundary Transfer" by Wayne Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is evaluated on a dataset, and the introduction elaborates on the need for datasets in the context of face reenactment.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I find two datasets explicitly mentioned:

1. **Celebrity Video Dataset (CelebV)**: The authors describe this dataset as containing videos of five celebrities (Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron, Theresa May, Jack Ma, and Kathleen) collected from YouTube. The dataset consists of 200,000 annotated faces with 98 landmarks.

2. **Boundary Estimation Dataset**: This dataset is created by combining two existing datasets, WFLW and Helen, to generate ground truth boundary heatmaps. The WFLW dataset contains 10,000 photos with 98 annotated landmarks, while the Helen dataset provides additional annotations for the nose boundary.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **WFLW dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wu, W., Qian, C., Yang, S., Wang, Q., Cai, Y., Zhou, Q. "Look at boundary: A boundary-aware face alignment algorithm." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

- For the **Helen dataset**, the citation is:
  > Le, V., Brandt, J., Lin, Z., Bourdev, L.D., Huang, T.S. "Interactive facial feature localization." In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

- For the **Celebrity Video Dataset**, since it is a dataset created by the authors, I will note that it is available on their project page, but it does not have a formal citation in the references.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for WFLW and Helen datasets, and note the availability of the Celebrity Video Dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
