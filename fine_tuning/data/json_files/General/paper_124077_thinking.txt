To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HDformer: A Higher-Dimensional Transformer for Detecting Diabetes Utilizing Long-Range Vascular Signals" by Ella Lan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved state-of-the-art results on the **MIMIC-III dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets and Environment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the **MIMIC-III dataset**. They describe it as a comprehensive single-center database covering 38,597 distinct adult patients admitted to critical care units, which includes vital signs like PPG and ECG, medications, laboratory measurements, and diagnostic codes.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **MIMIC-III dataset** is as follows:
> Alistair EW Johnson, Tom J Pollard, Lu Shen, Li-wei H Lehman, Mengling Feng, Mohammad Ghassemi, Benjamin Moody, Peter Szolovits, Leo Anthony Celi, and Roger G Mark. *MIMIC-III, a freely accessible critical care database*. Scientific data, 3(1):1â€“9, 2016.

Since the paper primarily discusses the MIMIC-III dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry with the full citation into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured accurately.
