To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Categorical Perception: A Groundwork for Deep Learning" by Laurent Bonnasse-Gahot and Jean-Pierre Nadal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, and the introduction often discusses relevant datasets used in the research.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 3 (Results)**, where the authors describe their experiments. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the models. I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their structure or content.

In this paper, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors use this dataset to illustrate categorical perception in neural networks.

2. **Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats Dataset**: This dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, which the authors use to investigate categorical perception in a convolutional neural network.

3. **ImageNet Dataset**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks, which contains over a million images categorized into 1,000 classes. The authors reference this dataset in the context of their experiments with deep networks.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats Dataset**:
  > Kaggle. *Dogs vs. Cats*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.

- For **ImageNet Dataset**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant information is accurately captured for future reference.
