To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Recipe for Social Media Analysis" by Shahid Alam and Juvariya Khan, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of social media analysis but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and subsequent sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention various social media platforms but do not provide specific datasets. I will continue to the **methodology section** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of their analysis.

Next, I will examine the **applications section**, where the authors describe how the SMA model can be applied in different domains such as education, healthcare, and government. While they provide examples of how to use social media data, they do not explicitly name any datasets.

Since the paper does not seem to reference specific datasets directly, I will check the **references section** to see if any cited works include datasets that could be relevant to the SMA model. I will look for any studies or papers that might have provided datasets for social media analysis.

Upon reviewing the references, I find several citations that could potentially lead to datasets:

1. **G. F. Khan, Social media for Government: A Practical Guide to Understanding, Implementing, and Managing Social Media Tools in the Public Sphere. Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd, 2017.** This book may contain datasets or references to datasets used in government social media analysis.

2. **P. N. Howard et al., “Opening closed regimes: what was the role of social media during the arab spring?,” Available at SSRN 2595096, 2011.** This paper likely discusses datasets related to social media activity during significant political events.

3. **M. Newton, How Social Networks Are Helping Indian Farmers Hit By the Coronavirus Lockdowns. https://en.reset.org/blog/howsocial-networks-are-helping-indian-farmers-hit-coronavirus-lockdowns-06102020, 10 July 2020.** This article may provide insights or datasets related to social media's impact on farmers during the pandemic.

After identifying these references, I will compile the full citations for each dataset or relevant work that could lead to datasets. 

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the full citation as required. Since the paper does not explicitly list datasets, I will note that the datasets are inferred from the references rather than directly stated in the text.
