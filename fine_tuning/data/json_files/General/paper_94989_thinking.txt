To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Deep Features in Instrumental Variable Regression" by Liyuan Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and results, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. In this section, I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing Section 4.1, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **Demand Design Dataset**: This dataset is described as a synthetic dataset introduced by Hartford et al. (2017) that serves as a standard benchmark for testing nonlinear IV methods. It includes observable confounders and is used to predict demands for airplane tickets based on price and other factors.

2. **dSprites Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in Section 4.2 and is described as an image dataset characterized by five latent parameters (shape, scale, rotation, posX, and posY). The authors use this dataset to generate data for IV regression tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Demand Design Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hartford, J., Lewis, G., Leyton-Brown, K., & Taddy, M. (2017). Deep IV: A flexible approach for counterfactual prediction. In Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning.

- For the **dSprites Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Matthey, L., Higgins, I., Hassabis, D., & Lerchner, A. (2017). dSprites: Disentanglement testing sprites dataset. Retrieved from https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets used in the research paper along with their full citations.
