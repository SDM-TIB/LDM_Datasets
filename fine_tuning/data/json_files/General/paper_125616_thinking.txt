To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Forward and Backward Compatible Framework for Few-shot Class-incremental Pill Recognition" by Jinghua Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors constructed a new pill image dataset for Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL), which suggests that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (FCPILL Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset in detail. Here, they mention that they collected 473,148 original pill packet images from real hospital environments, which is a significant dataset. They also specify that the dataset contains 100 classes, each with 600 images, and that it was constructed to address the limitations of existing datasets.

In addition to the FCPill dataset, the authors also reference another dataset, the **CURE dataset**, which is used for comparison in their experiments. I will need to gather details about both datasets.

For the **FCPill dataset**, the authors provide a comprehensive description of how the data was collected and annotated, which includes the number of images and classes. I will summarize this information as follows:
- **FCPill Dataset**: Contains 473,148 images collected from hospital environments, categorized into 100 classes with 600 images each.

For the **CURE dataset**, the authors mention that it contains 1,873 images across 196 classes. I will summarize this as:
- **CURE Dataset**: Contains 1,873 images across 196 classes, originally proposed for Few-shot Learning (FSL).

Next, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for both datasets. The authors cite the CURE dataset as follows:
- For **CURE Dataset**:

Since the FCPill dataset is newly constructed by the authors, it may not have a formal citation yet, but I will note that it is introduced in this paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured summary of the datasets used in the research.
