To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Grouped Knowledge Distillation for Deep Face Recognition" by Weisong Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on popular face recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for any mentions of datasets used for training and testing. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they utilized the **MS1MV2 dataset** for training, which consists of 5.8 million facial images of 85,000 individuals. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention several **testing datasets** used to evaluate their method, including:

1. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset consists of 13,233 facial images of 5,749 individuals and is commonly used for face verification tasks.

2. **CFP-FP (Celebrities in Frontal-Profile)**: This dataset is designed to facilitate large pose variation and is used for face verification.

3. **CPLFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: This dataset emphasizes challenges related to cross-pose face recognition.

4. **AgeDB**: A manually collected cross-age database that is used for evaluating age-related face recognition performance.

5. **CALFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: This dataset is constructed based on LFW to study cross-age face recognition challenges.

6. **IJB-B and IJB-C**: These are challenging public template-based benchmarks for face recognition, with IJB-B containing 1,845 subjects and IJB-C being an extension with about 3,500 identities.

7. **MegaFace Challenge**: This dataset includes a gallery set of 1 million images of 690,000 subjects and a probe set of 100,000 photos of 530 individuals.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will include:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
