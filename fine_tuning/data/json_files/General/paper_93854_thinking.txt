To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarially Robust Learning via Entropic Regularization" by Gauri Jagatap et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The authors mention achieving competitive performance on benchmark datasets such as **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more context. The authors discuss adversarial training and robustness, but I need to find specific mentions of datasets. They refer to "benchmark datasets" but do not provide details yet.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. They provide details about the models trained on these datasets, including the architectures and training setups.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors mention using a five-layer convolutional model trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digits. The dataset is widely used for benchmarking image classification algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The authors also mention using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. They describe training a WideResNet-34-10 model on this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
