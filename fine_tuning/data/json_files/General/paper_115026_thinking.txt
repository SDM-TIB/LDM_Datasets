To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Provable Adaptivity of Adam under Non-uniform Smoothness" by Bohan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific names, descriptions, or characteristics of the datasets.

If the paper includes a **results or experiments section**, I will check for any references to datasets used in the experiments, including performance metrics or comparisons that might indicate the datasets' relevance.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

Once I have gathered all the relevant information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, making sure to include all necessary details for each dataset, such as the authors, title, publication venue, and any relevant links or identifiers.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
