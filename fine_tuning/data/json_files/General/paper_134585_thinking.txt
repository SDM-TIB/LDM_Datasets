To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting Hybrid Terrestrial/LEO Satellite Systems for Rural Connectivity" by Houcem Ben Salem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus on hybrid terrestrial/satellite networks, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of these networks for rural connectivity but again does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look through the **methodology** and **numerical results** sections, as these often contain details about the datasets used for simulations or experiments. In this paper, the authors refer to simulation parameters in **Table I**, which outlines various parameters related to the satellite and terrestrial networks, but it does not list any specific datasets.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for analysis or experiments, I will check the **references** section to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of other research papers and articles that discuss related topics but do not provide specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, I conclude that there are no datasets explicitly mentioned or utilized in this research. Therefore, I will not be able to provide any dataset citations as there are none to extract.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for any mentions of datasets.
2. Examining the methodology and numerical results sections for details on datasets used in simulations.
3. Checking the references for any cited datasets.

Since no datasets were found in the paper, I will document this finding accordingly.
