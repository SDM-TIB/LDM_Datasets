To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bringing order into the realm of Transformer-based language models for artificial intelligence and law" by Candida M. Greco and Andrea Tagarelli, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments or results sections**. This is where authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation, including their characteristics and sources.

In the paper, I will find specific datasets mentioned, such as:

1. **ECHR Dataset**: This dataset contains allegations of violated provisions regarding the European Convention of Human Rights. It includes a list of facts and a score representing the importance of the case in the development of case law.

2. **Swiss-Judgment-Prediction (SJP)**: This dataset comprises 85K cases from the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, annotated with publication years, legal areas, and cantons of origin.

3. **GerDaLIR**: A dataset for legal precedent retrieval on German language cases, based on case laws gathered from Open Legal Data.

   Citation:
   > Wrzalik, M., & Krechel, D. (2021). GerDaLIR: A German Dataset for Legal Information Retrieval. In Proceedings of the 2021 Workshop on Natural Legal Language Processing (NLLP), pages 123–128.

4. **CUAD**: A dataset for legal contract review, containing over 500 contracts with annotations across 41 category labels provided by legal experts.

   Citation:
   > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Chen, A., & Ball, S. (2021). CUAD: an expert-annotated NLP dataset for legal contract review. In Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

5. **Multi-LexSum**: A collection of expert-edited abstractive summaries for a large number of civil rights cases.

   Citation:
   > Shen, Z., Lo, K., Yu, L., Dahlberg, N., Schlanger, M., & Downey, D. (2022). Multi-LexSum: Real-world Summaries of Civil Rights Lawsuits at Multiple Granularities. In Proceedings of the Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS).

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve their full citations from the references section of the paper. This will involve cross-referencing the citations provided in the text with the complete reference list to ensure accuracy.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
