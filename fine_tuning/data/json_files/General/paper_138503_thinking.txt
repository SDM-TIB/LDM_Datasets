To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARGS: Alignment as Reward-Guided Search" by Maxim Khanov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions the use of the **HH-RLHF (Helpful and Harmless)** dataset, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is significant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention using the **HH-RLHF dataset** for their evaluations. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of training and test samples, as well as the nature of the data (i.e., prompts and responses).

Additionally, I will look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper. In Section 3.4, the authors refer to the **Stanford Human Preferences (SHP)** dataset, which is also used for alignment tasks. I will gather details about this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. For the **HH-RLHF dataset**, the citation is:
   > Bai, Y., Jones, A., Ndousse, K., Askell, A., Chen, A., DasSarma, N., Drain, D., Fort, S., Ganguli, D., Henighan, T., Joseph, N., Kadavath, S., Kernion, J., et al. (2022). *Training a helpful and harmless assistant with reinforcement learning from human feedback*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.05862.

2. For the **Stanford Human Preferences (SHP) dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ethayarajh, K., Choi, Y., & Swayamdipta, S. (2022). *Understanding dataset difficulty with V-usable information*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
