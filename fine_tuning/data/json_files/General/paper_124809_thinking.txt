To extract datasets from the research paper titled "X-TIME: An in-memory engine for accelerating machine learning on tabular data with CAMs" by Giacomo Pedretti et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not detail specific datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets used in experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimentation section** (Section IV in this case), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that outlines the datasets, including their characteristics such as the number of samples, features, and classes.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find a table (Table II) that lists several datasets along with their details. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Churn modelling**: This dataset is used for binary classification with 10,000 samples and 10 features.
2. **Eye movements**: This dataset is for multiclass classification with 10,936 samples and 26 features.
3. **Forest cover type**: Another multiclass classification dataset with 581,012 samples and 54 features.
4. **Gas concentration**: This dataset is used for multiclass classification with 13,910 samples and 129 features.
5. **Gesture phase segmentation**: A multiclass classification dataset with 9,873 samples and 32 features.
6. **Telco customer churn**: This dataset is for binary classification with 7,032 samples and 19 features.
7. **Rossmann stores sales**: This dataset is used for regression with 610,253 samples and an unspecified number of features.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. The citations may not always be directly provided in the paper, but I can look for the original sources or related works mentioned in the references.

For the datasets, I will compile the following citations based on the references provided in the paper:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to format this information according to the required structure for further processing or review.
