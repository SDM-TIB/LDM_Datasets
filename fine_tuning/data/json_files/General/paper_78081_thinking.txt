To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comicolorization: Semi-Automatic Manga Colorization" by Chie Furusawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors developed a semi-automatic colorization system for manga images and references the **Manga 109 dataset**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail. The **Results and Discussion** section mentions that the authors colorized all monochrome manga in the **Manga 109 Dataset** using their tool. This confirms the dataset's relevance to their experiments.

I will also check the **Training** section, where the authors describe the training dataset. They mention that they collected hand-drawn character images from **niconico-seiga**, which is a large illustration-sharing website in Japan. They used a total of 160,000 images as the training dataset after filtering for low saturation images.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper:

1. **Manga 109 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yusuke Matsui, Kota Ito, Yuji Aramaki, Toshihiko Yamasaki, and Kiyoharu Aizawa. *Sketch-based Manga Retrieval using Manga109 Dataset*. In Multimedia Tools and Applications (MTAP). Springer, 2016.

2. **niconico-seiga Dataset**: Since this dataset is not formally published in a paper, I will note it as a dataset sourced from a website:
   > niconico-seiga. Available at: http://seiga.nicovideo.jp/

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for reference.
