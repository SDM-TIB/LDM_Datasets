To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy Preserving Stochastic Channel-Based Federated Learning with Neural Network Pruning" by Rulin Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions a method for federated learning and hints at the use of local datasets for training. This suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at the **Material and Methods** section, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset for Experiment**. Here, the authors provide specific details about the dataset used in their experiments. They mention that the data consists of **30,760 admissions with status information from hospitals**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, the authors also specify how the dataset is divided: **60% for training, 10% for validation, and 30% for testing**. This information is important for understanding the dataset's structure and usage in the experiments.

Now, I will extract the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the dataset, but it describes the dataset's origin as being provided by hospitals. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from hospital admissions data, but I will also acknowledge that a formal citation is not provided in the paper.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Hospital Admissions Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of 30,760 admissions with status information (alive or expired). It includes binary input features indicating whether a patient took each of 2,917 different medicines after admission. The dataset is split into 60% for training, 10% for validation, and 30% for testing.
   - **Citation**: No formal citation provided; data sourced from hospitals.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the dataset details and provided the necessary citation information, even if it is limited.
