To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilled Semantics for Comprehensive Scene Understanding from Videos" by Fabio Tosi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview, and the introduction often discusses the motivation and context for the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to two primary datasets:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The authors describe it as a collection of 42,382 stereo sequences taken in urban environments, widely used for benchmarking geometric understanding tasks such as depth, flow, and pose estimation.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 22,973 stereo pairs taken from a moving vehicle in various weather conditions, featuring higher resolution and quality images compared to KITTI.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets easily.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **KITTI Dataset**:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In CVPR, 2012.

- For the **Cityscapes Dataset**:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the representation of each dataset's significance and usage in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset.
