To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Re-ranking Object Proposals for Object Detection in Automatic Driving" by Zhun Zhong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **KITTI benchmark**, which suggests that this dataset is likely to be important.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. In this section, they explicitly mention the **KITTI detection benchmark dataset**. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the number of images and labeled objects.

The authors describe the KITTI dataset as consisting of three categories: **Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist**, with a total of **7,481 images for training and 7,518 images for testing**, and **80,256 labeled objects**. They also mention that the evaluation for each class has three difficulty levels: Easy, Moderate, and Hard.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the KITTI dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citation for the KITTI dataset is:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **KITTI Detection Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating object detection methods in the context of automatic driving. It includes images and labeled objects across three categories (Car, Pedestrian, Cyclist) and is structured to facilitate performance evaluation under varying difficulty levels.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
