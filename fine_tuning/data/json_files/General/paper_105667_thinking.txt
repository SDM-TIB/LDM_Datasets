To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of an Anomaly Detector for Routers using Parameterizable Malware" by John Carter and Spiros Mancoridis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract mentions the use of "custom-made parameterizable malware" in an IoT ecosystem, which suggests that the datasets may be related to the malware types and their behaviors.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Malware)**, where the authors describe the three types of malware they created: **keylogger**, **ransomware**, and **cryptominer**. Each of these malware types is likely to have associated datasets generated during their execution, particularly in terms of system calls and network traffic.

In **section 4 (Anomaly Detection Model)**, the authors discuss the feature sets used for the anomaly detection model, which are derived from system calls and network traffic flows on the Pi-Router. This section is crucial as it indicates that the datasets are based on the behavior of the malware during the experiments.

I will also look at **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the setup of the Pi-Router and the connected devices. This section may provide additional context on how the datasets were collected and the environment in which the experiments were conducted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned in the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The key datasets I will extract include:

1. **Keylogger Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the keylogger malware, which tracks key presses and exfiltrates them. The details about how this dataset was collected and its characteristics will be noted.

2. **Ransomware Dataset**: This dataset comes from the ransomware malware, which encrypts files and exfiltrates them. I will document how the data was collected and any specific parameters used during the experiments.

3. **Cryptominer Dataset**: This dataset is generated from the cryptominer malware, which simulates coin mining. I will note the characteristics of this dataset and how it was utilized in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for each dataset based on the information provided in the paper and any relevant references. This will ensure that I have properly attributed the sources of the datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
