To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Domain Adversarial Learning" by Alice Schoenauer Sebag et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions a novel bioimage dataset called **CELL**, which is a strong indicator that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of leveraging multiple datasets in automated microscopy. They emphasize the importance of datasets with overlapping but distinct class sets, which suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

In the **Datasets section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **DIGITS**: This includes well-known datasets like MNIST and MNIST-M, which are used for digit recognition tasks.
2. **OFFICE**: A dataset used for domain adaptation tasks, which includes images from different domains.
3. **CELL**: A novel bioimage dataset consisting of fluorescence microscopy images of cells, which is detailed further in the paper.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **CELL dataset**, the citation is:
> Kang, J., Hsu, C. H., Wu, Q., Liu, S., Posner, B. A., Altschuler, S. J., & Wu, L. F. (2016). Improving drug discovery with high-content phenotypic screens by systematic selection of reporter cell lines. *Nature Biotechnology*, 34(1), 70-77.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

For the **MNIST-M dataset**, the citation is:
> Ganin, Y., Ustinova, E., Ajakan, H., Germain, P., Larochelle, H., Laviolette, F., Marchand, M., & Lempitsky, V. (2016). Domain-adversarial training of neural networks. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 17(59), 1-35.

For the **OFFICE dataset**, the citation is:
> Saenko, K., Kulis, B., Fritz, M., & Darrell, T. (2010). Adapting visual category models to new domains. In *Computer Vision â€“ ECCV 2010* (pp. 213-226). Springer.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that all datasets are properly documented and attributed.
