To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accelerating Inference of Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Sparse Context Selection" by Yun Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Evaluation)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **PopQA**: This dataset is described as a large-scale open-domain question answering dataset consisting of 14,000 entity-centric QA pairs. The authors note that they used a specific setup for this dataset, which is crucial for understanding its application in their experiments.

2. **QMSum**: This dataset is a human-annotated benchmark for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization, consisting of 1,808 query-summary pairs over 232 meetings. The authors explain how they adapted this dataset for their RAG framework.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PopQA**, the citation is:
  > Mallen, A., Asai, A., Zhong, V., Das, R., Khashabi, D., & Hajishirzi, H. (2023). When not to trust language models: Investigating effectiveness of parametric and non-parametric memories. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), ACL 2023, Toronto, Canada, July 9-14, 2023, pages 9802â€“9822. Association for Computational Linguistics.

- For **QMSum**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, M., Yin, D., Yu, T., Awadallah, A. H., Celikyilmaz, A., Liu, Y., Qiu, X., et al. (2021). QMSum: A new benchmark for query-based multi-domain meeting summarization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.05938.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
