To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rank-Based Loss for Learning Hierarchical Representations" by Inês Nolasco and Dan Stowell, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and datasets sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but the datasets are likely detailed in the methods section, specifically under the datasets subsection.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss hierarchical classification and its relevance to audio classification, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will move on to the **methods section** where the datasets are explicitly described.

In **section 3.2 (Datasets)**, the authors mention three datasets used in their experiments:

1. **3 Bird Species Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings from three bird species: Little owl (Athene noctua), Chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), and Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis). It includes a total of 1707 recordings from 9 individuals, structured into a 3-level hierarchical taxonomy.

2. **Nsynth Dataset**: A large-scale dataset of annotated musical notes, containing 4-second audio snippets played with different instruments. For this work, a selection of 1707 audio snippets from 9 instruments across guitar, flutes, and keyboard families was used, organized into a 2-level hierarchical taxonomy.

3. **TUTacoustic2016 Dataset**: This dataset includes 30-second audio segments from 15 acoustic scenes, organized into three groups: indoor, outdoor, and vehicles. The selected data consists of 704 recordings from 9 acoustic scenes, balanced across the three groups.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **3 Bird Species Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dan Stowell, Tereza Petrusková, Martin Šálek, and Pavel Linhart. "Automatic acoustic identification of individuals in multiple species: improving identification across recording conditions." *Journal of The Royal Society Interface*, vol. 16, no. 153, pp. 20180940, Apr. 2019.

- For the **Nsynth Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jesse Engel, Cinjon Resnick, Adam Roberts, Sander Dieleman, Douglas Eck, Karen Simonyan, and Mohammad Norouzi. "Neural audio synthesis of musical notes with wavenet autoencoders." 2017.

- For the **TUTacoustic2016 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Annamaria Mesaros, Toni Heittola, and Tuomas Virtanen. "TUT acoustic scenes 2016, development dataset." Feb. 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and comprehensively.
