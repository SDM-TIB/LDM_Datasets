        "dcterms:description": "The dataset encompasses a detailed array of spatial, temporal, and meteorological data crucial for analyzing and predicting forest fire behavior in Montesinho Park, Portugal. It includes precise spatial coordinates to pinpoint high-risk zones, temporal details that highlight seasonal and weekly trends in fire occurrences, and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall that directly affect fire dynamics. Furthermore, the dataset features a target variable, the burned area, which quantifies the extent of forest damage, providing valuable insights into fire severity.",
