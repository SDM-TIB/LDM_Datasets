To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensembles of Random SHAPs" by Lev V. Utkin and Andrei V. Konstantinov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant details such as the number of instances or features.

In this paper, the authors mention using **synthetic datasets** generated for their experiments, as well as two real datasets: **Boston Housing dataset** and **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset:

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: This dataset consists of 506 instances, each described by 13 features. It is commonly used for regression tasks related to housing prices.

2. **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**: This dataset contains 569 instances, each described by 30 features. It is used for classification tasks to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Boston Housing dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harrison, D. J., & Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1), 81-102.

- For the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wolberg, W. H., & Mangasarian, O. L. (1990). *Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast fine-needle aspirates*. Cancer Letters, 77(2), 163-171.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
