To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Transitive Information Theory and its Application to Deep Generative Models" by Trung Ngo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of these datasets in the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and evaluation. I will pay close attention to any specific names, characteristics, and the context in which these datasets are utilized.

In the **experiments section**, the authors may provide details about the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any preprocessing steps taken. If the datasets are benchmark datasets, they might also mention their significance in the field.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **MNIST dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, publication venue, and year. The citation for MNIST is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

If the paper mentions other datasets like **Fashion MNIST** or **Shapes3D**, I will similarly find their citations:
- For **Fashion MNIST**:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*, 2017.
  
- For **Shapes3D**:
> Chris Burgess and Hyunjik Kim. *3D shapes dataset*. https://github.com/deepmind/3dshapes-dataset/, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture and present the datasets used in the research paper.
