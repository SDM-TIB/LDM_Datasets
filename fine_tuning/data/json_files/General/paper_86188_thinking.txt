To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BERT Meets Chinese Word Segmentation" by Haiqin Yang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets from the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3), where the author discusses the datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

In **Table 1**, the author provides statistics for two datasets:

1. **MSR Dataset**: This dataset has 87,000 sentences in the training set and 4,000 in the test set, with a total of 2,368,000 words. It includes 66 English words and 18,000 digits, with a total of 4,050,000 characters.

2. **PKU Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,000 sentences in the training set and 2,000 in the test set, with 1,154,000 words. It includes 443 English words and 20,000 digits, totaling 1,826,000 characters.

Both datasets are used in the experiments to evaluate the performance of the BERT model on the Chinese word segmentation task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bake-off as the source for these datasets. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MSR Dataset** and **PKU Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Emerson, T. (2005). The second international Chinese word segmentation bake-off. In SIGHAN@IJCNLP.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
