To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Universal Approximation in Dropout Neural Networks" by Oxana A. Manita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract primarily discusses the theoretical contributions of the paper, so I will focus more on the introduction and methodology sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the universal approximation property of neural networks but do not mention any specific datasets. I will then check the **experiments or results sections** to see if any datasets are referenced in the context of experiments or evaluations.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors refer to various neural network architectures and their performance but do not specify any datasets used for training or testing. This suggests that the paper may be more theoretical and focused on proving concepts rather than empirical validation with specific datasets.

Next, I will look at the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through other works. However, the references primarily consist of foundational papers on neural networks and dropout techniques, without specific datasets being highlighted.

Since no datasets are explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that this research does not utilize any specific datasets for its theoretical claims. Therefore, I will not be able to provide full citations for datasets as none are present in the text.

In summary, my extraction process involved:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Checking the methodology and experiments sections for any dataset references.
3. Reviewing the references for indirect mentions of datasets.

Ultimately, I found that the paper does not include specific datasets, and thus, there are no citations to provide.
