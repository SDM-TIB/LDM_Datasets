To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-Tune Longformer for Jointly Predicting Rumor Stance and Veracity" by Anant Khandelwal, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors propose a framework for predicting rumor stance and veracity on the dataset released at **SemEval 2019 RumorEval**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for more context about the dataset. The introduction mentions that the dataset consists of social media rumors from Reddit and Twitter, confirming its relevance to the study.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors specifically refer to the **SemEval 2019 Task 7 dataset** for both stance classification and veracity prediction. They describe the dataset as containing conversation threads from Twitter and Reddit, which is essential for understanding the context of their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **references section** for the full citation of the SemEval 2019 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **SemEval 2019 RumorEval Dataset**:
  > Genevieve Gorrell, Elena Kochkina, Maria Liakata, Ahmet Aker, Arkaitz Zubiaga, Kalina Bontcheva, and Leon Derczynski. *SemEval-2019 Task 7: RumourEval, Determining Rumour Veracity and Support for Rumours*. In Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA, 845â€“854, 2019. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/S19-2147

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **SemEval 2019 RumorEval Dataset**: This dataset includes conversation threads discussing rumors from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. It is used for tasks related to stance classification (support, deny, query, comment) and veracity prediction (true, false, unverified).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
