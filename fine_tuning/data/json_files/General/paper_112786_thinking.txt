To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Guided Diffusion Model for Adversarial Purification from Random Noise" by Quanlin Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** of the paper. Here, the authors mention achieving a robust accuracy of 89.62% on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. This indicates that CIFAR-10 is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will move to the **introduction** section. In this section, the authors discuss adversarial attacks and defense strategies, but they do not introduce any new datasets. However, the mention of CIFAR-10 in the abstract is a strong indicator that it is a primary dataset for their work.

I will then check the **experiments** section, specifically looking for any detailed descriptions of datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Evaluation Results)**, the authors present results against adversarial attacks on the CIFAR-10 dataset. They provide performance metrics, confirming that CIFAR-10 is indeed the dataset they utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community, and its citation is typically included in the literature. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:

- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will conclude that the only dataset extracted from this paper is CIFAR-10.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry for CIFAR-10, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will be ready for any structured output or further processing.
