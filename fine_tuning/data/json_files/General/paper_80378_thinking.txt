To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-Expressive Decompositions for Matrix Approximation and Clustering" by Eva L. Dyer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methods and applications, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **Section V (Numerical Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their evaluations. This section is likely to contain detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their sizes and characteristics.

In **Section V.A (Datasets and Evaluation Setup)**, the authors list several datasets:

1. **Face Dataset**: This dataset consists of images of ten subjects' faces under various illumination conditions, resulting in a dataset of size 4032 × 631.

2. **Hyperspectral (HS) Dataset**: This dataset consists of 204 images from the Salinas scene, with each image containing spatial information at different spectral bands, resulting in a dataset of size 204 × 54129.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: This well-known dataset contains 50,000 images of handwritten digits, resulting in a dataset of size 784 × 50,000.

4. **Neuro Dataset**: This dataset consists of the firing rates of 187 neurons collected at 875 time points during a motor task, resulting in a dataset of size 187 × 875.

5. **Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) Dataset**: A synthetic dataset consisting of signals drawn from a union of two subspaces with a 3-dimensional overlap, resulting in a dataset of size 450, with 300 points in the first subspace, 100 points in the second, and 50 outlier points.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. However, since some datasets like MNIST and the Face dataset are well-known, I may already know their citations:

- For the **Face Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Georghiades, A. S., Belhumeur, P. N., & Kriegman, D. J. (2001). From few to many: Illumination cone models for face recognition under variable lighting and pose. *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, 23(6), 643-660.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Jackel, L. D., et al. (1995). Comparison of learning algorithms for handwritten digit recognition. In *International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks* (pp. 53-60).

- The **Hyperspectral (HS) Dataset** and **Neuro Dataset** may not have specific citations in the references, as they are often used in the community without formal publications. I will note that they are commonly used datasets.

- The **Union-of-Subspaces (UoS) Dataset** is synthetic and may not have a formal citation, but I will document its description as provided in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable, and prepare them for structured output as needed. This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
