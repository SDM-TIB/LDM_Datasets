To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiresolution Deep Implicit Functions for 3D Shape Representation" by Zhang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a new model for 3D shape representation, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the popularity of deep implicit functions (DIF) in various applications, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned. I will continue to the methodology and experiments sections for more details.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets & Metrics)**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **ShapeNet dataset**. They mention using train/test splits from **3D-R2N2**, which is a significant clue that there are datasets involved in their experiments.

Next, I will gather details about the **ShapeNet dataset**. The paper cites it as follows:
- **ShapeNet Dataset**: A rich 3D model repository used for various tasks in 3D shape analysis. The authors mention using a subset of 13 categories from this dataset.

I will also look for the citation of the **3D-R2N2 dataset**, which is referenced in the context of train/test splits. The citation for this dataset is:
- **3D-R2N2 Dataset**: A unified approach for single and multi-view 3D object reconstruction, as described in the paper by Choy et al. (2016).

Now, I will compile the full citations for both datasets from the references section of the paper:

1. For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
   > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, Jianxiong Xiao, Li Yi, and Fisher Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Technical Report arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, 2015.

2. For **3D-R2N2**, the citation is:
   > Christopher B. Choy, Danfei Xu, JunYoung Gwak, Kevin Chen, and Silvio Savarese. *3D-R2N2: A Unified Approach for Single and Multi-View 3D Object Reconstruction*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 628–644, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
