To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Recommending Insurance products by using Usersâ€™ Sentiments" by Rohan Parasrampuria et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be referenced. The abstract discusses the use of sentiment analysis for recommending insurance products, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **Proposed Model section** (Section 3) where the authors describe the process of collecting datasets related to insurance. They mention collecting data that includes customer specifications such as age, gender, locality, income range, and sentiment scores along with feedback lines. However, they do not specify any particular datasets or sources from which this data is derived.

I will also check the **Result Analysis section** (Section 4) to see if any datasets are mentioned in the context of the results. The authors discuss the attributes of their dataset and show a data slice in Fig. 8, but again, they do not provide specific names or citations for any datasets used.

Finally, I will review the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the works referenced. The references primarily focus on sentiment analysis and recommendation systems but do not provide specific datasets related to the authors' work.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any named datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no specific datasets to extract from this paper. However, I will note that the authors imply the need for a dataset that includes customer feedback and attributes for their model, but they do not provide a formal citation for such a dataset.

In summary, I will document the findings as follows:
- No specific datasets were identified in the paper.
- The authors discuss the need for a dataset but do not provide citations or names for any datasets used.

This process highlights the importance of looking for explicit mentions of datasets and their citations in research papers, as well as recognizing when datasets are implied but not formally documented.
