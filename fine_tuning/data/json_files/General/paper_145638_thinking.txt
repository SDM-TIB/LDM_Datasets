To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hitchhikerâ€™s guide on Energy-Based Models: a comprehensive review on the relation with other generative models, sampling and statistical physics" by Davide Carbone, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodologies and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I will focus on sections that are likely to contain specific references to datasets.

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. If the authors discuss the importance of datasets or refer to specific datasets used in their analysis, I will note those down.

I will then examine the **methodology and results sections** for any detailed descriptions of datasets. This includes looking for any tables, figures, or references to datasets that may be used for training or evaluation purposes. If the authors mention datasets in the context of experiments or comparisons with other models, I will make sure to capture those details.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like "CIFAR-10," I would look for the original paper or source that describes this dataset to ensure I have the correct citation. 

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for presenting this information.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
