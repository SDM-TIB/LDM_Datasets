To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stable LM 2 1.6B Technical Report" by Marco Bellagente et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss datasets and experiments**. The abstract mentions that the report details the data and training procedure, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Model Pre-Training)**, where the authors describe the training data used for the model. Here, they list several datasets along with their sampling weights and the number of tokens. This section is crucial as it provides a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the training process.

In **Table 1**, the authors enumerate the datasets used for pre-training, including:

1. **Arxiv**: A dataset containing academic papers.
2. **PubMed**: A dataset of biomedical literature.
3. **S2ORC**: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus.
4. **PhilPapers**: A dataset of philosophical papers.
5. **BookCorpusOpen**: A dataset of books.
6. **PG-19**: A dataset of fanfiction.
7. **Cultura-X (EN, ES, DE, FR, IT, NL, PT)**: Multilingual datasets.
8. **C4**: A dataset of web pages.
9. **OpenWebText2**: A dataset of web text.
10. **RefinedWeb**: A refined dataset of web data.
11. **StackExchange**: A dataset of Q&A from Stack Exchange.
12. **HackerNews**: A dataset of discussions from Hacker News.
13. **EuroParl**: A dataset of European Parliament proceedings.
14. **FreeLaw**: A dataset of legal documents.
15. **PileOfLaw**: A dataset of legal texts.
16. **DM Math**: A dataset for mathematical problems.
17. **AMPS**: A dataset for mathematical problem solving.
18. **OpenWebMath**: A dataset of mathematical web text.
19. **RedPajama Wiki**: A dataset of wiki articles.
20. **Starcoder**: A dataset for coding tasks.
21. **Restruct-v1**: A dataset for instruction tuning.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. For example, the citation for the **Arxiv dataset** is typically attributed to the original Arxiv repository, while the **PubMed dataset** citation would reference the PubMed database.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will ensure that I format the citations correctly, following the style used in the paper.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite all relevant datasets from the paper, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the data used in the development of Stable LM 2 1.6B.
