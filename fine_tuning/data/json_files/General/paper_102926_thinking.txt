To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transformers Predicting the Future: Applying Attention in Next-Frame and Time Series Forecasting," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, experiments, and results sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus but may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and subsequent sections.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Transformers to various data types, including time series data, but do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 2.2 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors mention that they compared two architectures using the daily closing value of the S&P 500 index from January 3, 2000, to August 31, 2018. This indicates that the S&P 500 dataset is used for their time series forecasting experiments.

Next, in **section 3.1 (Methods)**, the authors describe their experiments with the VideoGPT model, which utilizes a dataset of moving MNIST. They mention that the moving MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits in a square box, which they generated from static MNIST images.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. For the **S&P 500 dataset**, while the paper does not provide a specific citation, I can reference the general source of the S&P 500 data:
   > S&P Dow Jones Indices. *S&P 500 Index*. Available at: https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/

2. For the **moving MNIST dataset**, the authors reference a pre-generated open-source dataset:
   > Nitish Srivastava, Elman Mansimov, and Ruslan Salakhudinov. *Unsupervised Learning of Video Representations Using LSTMs*. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 843â€“852. PMLR, 2015. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/

With these datasets identified and their citations noted, I will now prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
