To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Looking for Tiny Defects via Forward–Backward Feature Transfer" by Alex Costanzino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a benchmark for evaluating anomaly detection and segmentation methods, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Tiny Anomalies benchmark)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their benchmark. Here, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **VisA Dataset**: This dataset is characterized by high-resolution images with varying dimensions and includes anomalies of different sizes. The authors provide details about the number of images and the types of objects included.

2. **MVTec AD Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing images from various industrial inspection scenarios, with specific details about the number of images and types of anomalies present.

In this section, the authors provide enough detail to confirm that both datasets are utilized in their experiments. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **VisA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zou, Y., Jeong, J., Pemula, L., Zhang, D., Dabeer, O. (2022). *Spot-the-difference self-supervised pre-training for anomaly detection and segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.14315.

- For the **MVTec AD Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bergmann, P., Fauser, M., Sattlegger, D., Steger, C. (2019). *MVTec AD – A comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 954–963.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any critical details while extracting the datasets from the paper.
