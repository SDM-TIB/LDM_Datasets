To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Stability Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Real-Time Voltage Control" by Jie Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation and testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using **IEEE test feeders** for their experiments. I will look for specific references to these datasets in the text. For instance, they refer to the **IEEE 13-bus feeder** and the **IEEE 123-bus feeder** as part of their experimental setup.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **IEEE 13-bus feeder**, the citation is:
> Schneider, K. P., Mather, B. A., Pal, B. C., Ten, C.-W., Shirek, G. J., Zhu, H., Fuller, J. C., Pereira, J. L. R., Ochoa, L. F., de Araujo, R. C., Dugan, R. C., Matthias, S., Paudyal, T. E., McDermott, T. E., & Kersting, W. (2018). Analytic considerations and design basis for the IEEE distribution test feeders. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 33(3), 3181-3188.

For the **IEEE 123-bus feeder**, the citation is:
> Schneider, K. P., Mather, B. A., Pal, B. C., Ten, C.-W., Shirek, G. J., Zhu, H., Fuller, J. C., Pereira, J. L. R., Ochoa, L. F., de Araujo, R. C., Dugan, R. C., Matthias, S., Paudyal, T. E., McDermott, T. E., & Kersting, W. (2018). Analytic considerations and design basis for the IEEE distribution test feeders. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 33(3), 3181-3188.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be accessed by others interested in this research area.
