To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Movie Scene Detection using State-Space Transformers" by Md Mohaiminul Islam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on three movie scene detection datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **MovieNet**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset containing 1,100 movies with 1.6 million shots, of which 318 movies have ground-truth scene boundary annotations. The annotated subset is divided into training, validation, and testing splits.

2. **BBC**: This dataset consists of 11 episodes from the BBC TV series "Planet Earth," with an average duration of 50 minutes. It contains 670 scenes and 4,900 shots.

3. **OVSD**: This dataset includes 21 short films with an average duration of 30 minutes, totaling 10,000 shots and 300 scenes extracted from movie scripts.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. Here are the citations for each dataset:

- For **MovieNet**, the citation is:
  > Qingqiu Huang, Yu Xiong, Anyi Rao, Jiaze Wang, and Dahua Lin. *MovieNet: A Holistic Dataset for Movie Understanding*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 709–727, 2020.

- For **BBC**, the citation is:
  > BBC. *Planet Earth*. Available at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy.

- For **OVSD**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Rotman, Dror Porat, and Gal Ashour. *Robust and Efficient Video Scene Detection Using Optimal Sequential Grouping*. In 2016 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM), pages 275–280, 2016.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
