To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bayesian Optimization Over Iterative Learners with Structured Responses: A Budget-aware Planning Approach" by Syrine Belakaria et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but it may not contain detailed dataset information. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it often contains specific details about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I will look for any mentions of datasets in the following contexts:

1. **Specific Dataset Names**: I will note any datasets that are explicitly named, such as "MNIST," "CIFAR10," or "Olivetti."

2. **Dataset Descriptions**: I will extract any descriptions that provide information about the datasets, such as the number of samples, classes, and any preprocessing steps mentioned.

3. **References to Previous Work**: If the authors refer to datasets from other studies, I will check if those studies are cited in the references section for proper citation.

After identifying the datasets, I will then consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "MNIST dataset," I will look for its citation, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference.

By following this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper.
