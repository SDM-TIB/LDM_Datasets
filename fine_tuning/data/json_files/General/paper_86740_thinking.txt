To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Linguistic evaluation of German-English Machine Translation using a Test Suite" by Eleftherios Avramidis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a **grammatical test suite for German→English MT**, which suggests that there is a specific dataset or test suite being utilized.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the construction and application of the test suite. They mention that the test suite contains **5560 test sentences** designed to evaluate **107 phenomena organized in 14 categories**. This indicates that the test suite itself is a dataset.

I will also look for any references to other datasets or test suites that may have been used in the evaluation. The authors reference the **DFKI test suite for German→English MT** (Burchardt et al., 2017), which is crucial for my extraction.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the performance of various machine translation systems on the test suite, confirming its application and relevance. They do not mention any additional datasets, so I will focus on the DFKI test suite as the primary dataset.

Now, I will gather the full citation for the DFKI test suite mentioned in the paper:

- For the **DFKI Test Suite**, the citation is:
  > Aljoscha Burchardt, Vivien Macketanz, Jon Dehdari, Georg Heigold, Jan-Thorsten Peter, and Philip Williams. *A Linguistic Evaluation of Rule-Based, Phrase-Based, and Neural MT Engines*. The Prague Bulletin of Mathematical Linguistics, 108:159–170, 2017.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that the citation is included for any datasets referenced in the paper. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
