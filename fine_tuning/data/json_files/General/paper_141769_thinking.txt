To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Stealth: Adversarial Text Attacks on NLP Using Several Methods" by Roopkatha Dey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to locate any references to datasets. In the abstract, the authors mention leveraging the **IMDB, AG News, and SST2 datasets** for their comparative analysis of adversarial attacks. This indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on **Section 4 (Data and Models)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset consists of user reviews from IMDb, where each entry includes a review, user rating, and other relevant details. The dataset is used for sentiment analysis, with classes representing positive and negative sentiments.

2. **SST2 Dataset**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) is described as a meticulously annotated corpus for sentiment analysis, containing individual sentences from movie reviews, each associated with a binary sentiment classification.

3. **AG News Dataset**: This dataset comprises news articles from various sources, categorized into four classes (World, Sports, Business, Science/Technology), making it suitable for tasks like news categorization.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are well-known public datasets in the NLP community. Therefore, I will use the standard citations for these datasets based on common knowledge:

- **IMDB Dataset**:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, E., Pham, P. T., Huang, J., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. *Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies*, 142-150.

- **SST2 Dataset**:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank. *Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing*, 1631-1642.

- **AG News Dataset**:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhao, J., & LeCun, Y. (2015). Character-level convolutional networks for text classification. *Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems*, 649-657.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their descriptions and citations into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured accurately and is ready for review or downstream tasks.
