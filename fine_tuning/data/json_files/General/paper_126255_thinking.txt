To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-Modal Context Reasoning Approach for Conditional Inference on Joint Textual and Visual Clues" by Yunxin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two datasets, which suggests that specific names will be provided later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In **section 4.1**, they explicitly mention two datasets: **PMR** and **VCR**. I will take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

1. **PMR Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 12,080 training samples, 1,538 validation samples, and 1,742 testing samples. It is noted that the textual premises in this dataset have been cross-checked for quality.

2. **VCR Dataset**: The authors mention that they reorganized a large-scale dataset based on the VCR dataset, which contains 210k training samples, 2,923 validation samples, and 26,534 testing samples. They explain how they adapted the original task to fit their experimental design.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. 

- For the **PMR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Qingxiu Dong, Ziwei Qin, Heming Xia, Tian Feng, Shoujie Tong, Haoran Meng, Lin Xu, Zhongyu Wei, Weidong Zhan, Baobao Chang, et al. *Premise-based multimodal reasoning: Conditional inference on joint textual and visual clues*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 932–946, 2022.

- For the **VCR dataset**, the citation is:
  > Rowan Zellers, Yonatan Bisk, Ali Farhadi, and Yejin Choi. *From recognition to cognition: Visual commonsense reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 6720–6731, 2019.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their references as required.
