To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effectiveness of Deep Networks in NLP using BiDAF as an example architecture" by Soumyendu Sarkar, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, while the introduction sets the context for the experiments conducted. The data section is likely to contain explicit mentions of the datasets used.

In the **data section**, the author mentions using the **Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0**. The description states that SQuAD is a reading comprehension dataset consisting of questions posed by crowd workers on Wikipedia articles, with both answerable and unanswerable questions. This is a clear identification of the dataset being utilized in the research.

Next, I will look for the **full citation** of the SQuAD 2.0 dataset in the references section. The relevant citation is:

- **SQuAD 2.0**: 
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you donâ€™t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.03822, 2018.

Additionally, the author mentions splitting the SQuAD dataset into three parts: train, dev, and test sets, which are derived from the official SQuAD 2.0 training and dev data sets. However, since the dataset itself is SQuAD 2.0, I will only need to cite it once.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will allow for clear documentation of the dataset used in the research.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for SQuAD 2.0, ensuring that it is ready for any required output or further processing.
