To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of Bayesian Intervals for Tropical Storms" by Max Chiswick and Sam Ganzfried, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset from the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) containing data on about 500 tropical storms in the Atlantic Ocean. This suggests that the SHIPS dataset is a primary dataset used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Applying the model to Atlantic hurricanes)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the SHIPS dataset. They mention that the dataset includes data from Atlantic Ocean storms from 1982 to 2017, containing 499 storms and approximately 100 features, with data recorded at six-hour intervals. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

I will also check the **experiments section** to ensure that the SHIPS dataset is consistently referenced in the context of their experiments and results. The authors discuss their methodology and how they utilized the dataset for trajectory predictions, which reinforces its importance in their study.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the SHIPS dataset. The authors reference the SHIPS dataset as follows:
> SHIPS. SHIPS: Statistical tropical cyclone intensity forecast technique development. http://rammb.cira.colostate.edu/research/tropical_cyclones/ships/index.asp, 2019. Accessed: 2019-05-17.

Since the SHIPS dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SHIPS dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are captured accurately for further processing or review.
