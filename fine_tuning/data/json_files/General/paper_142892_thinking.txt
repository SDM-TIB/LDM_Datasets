To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GMP-TL: Gender-Augmented Multi-Scale Pseudo-Label Enhanced Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition" by Yu Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **IEMOCAP corpus**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Setups)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They specifically mention the **IEMOCAP corpus** and describe it as consisting of scripted and improvised interactions recorded in five sessions with 10 actors, labeled by three annotators. This section confirms that IEMOCAP is the primary dataset utilized in their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the IEMOCAP dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> C. Busso, M. Bulut, C.-C. Lee, et al., “IEMOCAP: Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture Database,” Language Resources and Evaluation, vol. 42, pp. 335–359, 2008.

Since the paper does not mention any additional datasets, I will compile the information about the IEMOCAP dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the IEMOCAP dataset. This will ensure that all necessary information is accurately captured for further processing or review.
