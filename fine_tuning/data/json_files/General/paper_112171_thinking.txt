To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semi-supervised MIMO Detection Using Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network" by Hongzhi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the proposed method and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for training and testing their models. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their sizes, types, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to MIMO detection or any other relevant datasets that may have been used for training or evaluation purposes. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source information for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Rayleigh fading channel data," I will look for the original source or paper where this dataset was introduced or described. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
