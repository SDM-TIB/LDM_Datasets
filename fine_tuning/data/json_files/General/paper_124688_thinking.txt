To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Music Annotation Pattern" by Jacopo de Berardinis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss examples and related work** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the introduction of the Music Annotation Pattern and its application in integrating music datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **usage examples section** (Section 4), where the authors provide specific instances of how the Music Annotation Pattern is applied. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **Mozart Piano Sonatas Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of chord annotations from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Piano Sonata no. 1 in C major (Allegro). The authors indicate that the original annotation is taken from this dataset.

2. **Isophonics Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of segment annotations from an audio track of The Beatles’ song "Michelle." The authors state that the original annotation is available in JAMS format and is taken from the Isophonics dataset.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For the **Mozart Piano Sonatas Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Hentschel, M. Neuwirth, M. Rohrmeier. *The annotated Mozart sonatas: Score, harmony, and cadence*. Trans. Int. Soc. Music. Inf. Retr. 4 (2021) 67–80.

- For the **Isophonics Dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Mauch, C. Cannam, M. Davies, S. Dixon, C. Harte, C. Kolozali, D. Tidhar. *OMRAS2 metadata project 2009*. In Late-breaking session at the 10th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR), 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper along with their full citations.
