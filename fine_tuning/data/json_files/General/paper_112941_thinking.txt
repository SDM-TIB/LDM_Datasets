To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Making Look-Ahead Active Learning Strategies Feasible with Neural Tangent Kernels" by Mohamad Amin Mohamadi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method achieves equal or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST**: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each of size 28x28 pixels.

2. **SVHN**: The Street View House Numbers dataset contains 73,257 training images and 26,032 test images of digits, each of size 32x32 pixels. It is noted to be more challenging than MNIST due to variations in the images.

3. **CIFAR10**: This dataset includes 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, also of size 32x32 pixels, and is divided into 10 classes.

4. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, but it is divided into 100 classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Li Deng. "The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digit Images for Machine Learning Research." IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 2012, pp. 141â€“142.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. "Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning." NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning, 2011.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images." 2009. (Note: CIFAR100 is derived from CIFAR10, so the same citation applies.)

Now that I have gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
