To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Single-Read Reconstruction for DNA Data Storage Using Transformers" by Yotam Nahum et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their approach by encoding text, image, and code-script files to DNA, which indicates that these files may be part of the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section. The authors describe three different types of data files used for evaluation:
1. A text file consisting of Darwinâ€™s "On the Origin of Species."
2. A code-script file containing the original code-script of the Apollo 11 mission.
3. An image file of "Torres del Paine."

I will note down these datasets and their descriptions. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Darwin text file**, the citation is:
  > Darwin, C. (1909). *The origin of species*. PF Collier & son New York.

- For the **Apollo code-script file**, the citation is:
  > Apollo 11 code-script. Retrieved from https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11 on September 1, 2021.

- For the **Torres del Paine image file**, the citation is:
  > Image downloaded from https://www.travelandleisure.com on September 1, 2021.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
