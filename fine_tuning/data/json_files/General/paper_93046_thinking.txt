To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems with Conditional Normalizing Flows" by Ali Siahkoohi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the use of paired samples (x, y) for training, which suggests that there may be datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Numerical experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in experiments. Here, the authors mention two specific datasets:

1. **Seismic Images Dataset**: This dataset is derived from a processed 3D seismic survey reported in Veritas and WesternGeco. The authors state that 2D patches were selected from the original 3D volume, resulting in 64 Ã— 64 pixel images. This dataset is normalized and used for the supervised training phase.

2. **Synthetic Data for Gaussian Likelihood**: The authors describe a synthetic dataset generated for testing their method, which includes observations y generated from a known prior distribution. While this dataset is synthetic, it is important to note its significance in the context of their experiments.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The seismic dataset is referenced in the context of two technical reports:

- For the **Seismic Images Dataset**, the citations are:
  > Veritas. *Parihaka 3D Marine Seismic Survey - Acquisition and Processing Report*. Technical Report New Zealand Petroleum Report 3460, New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals, Wellington, 2005.
  
  > WesternGeco. *Parihaka 3D PSTM Final Processing Report*. Technical Report New Zealand Petroleum Report 4582, New Zealand Petroleum & Minerals, Wellington, 2012.

The synthetic dataset does not have a specific citation as it is generated for the purpose of the study, but I will note that it is based on a Gaussian likelihood model.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for the seismic dataset while noting the synthetic dataset's context.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ready for further processing or review.
