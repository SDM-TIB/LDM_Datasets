To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LM4HPC: Towards Effective Language Model Application in High-Performance Computing" by Le Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses HPC-specific datasets, which suggests that there will be detailed descriptions later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Approach)**, where the authors outline their framework and mention specific datasets. In this section, they explicitly list several datasets that are crucial for their experiments. I will take note of each dataset mentioned, including any descriptions provided.

In **subsection 3.3 (Datasets)**, the authors detail the datasets they have worked with:

1. **POJ-104**: This dataset is derived from a pedagogical programming open judge system that evaluates the validity of submitted source code. It is particularly useful for code similarity tasks.

2. **DRB-ML**: This dataset contains 658 C/C++ OpenMP kernels derived from DataRaceBench. The authors extended it to include labels indicating whether a kernel is parallelizable.

3. **OMP4Par**: An open-source benchmark dataset composed of code crawled from GitHub, OpenMP benchmarks, and synthetic code. It includes loops labeled for parallelism detection.

4. **OMPQA**: A newly created dataset for OpenMP question answering, which includes various request-response pairs related to OpenMP.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For **POJ-104**:
  > Mou, L., Li, G., Zhang, L., Wang, T., Jin, Z. (2016). *Convolutional neural networks over tree structures for programming language processing*. In Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, vol. 30.

- For **DRB-ML**:
  > Lin, P.H., Liao, C. (2022). *Drb-ml-dataset*. https://doi.org/10.11579/1958879.

- For **OMP4Par**:
  > Chen, L., Mahmud, Q.I., Phan, H., Ahmed, N.K., Jannesari, A. (2023). *Learning to Parallelize with OpenMP by Augmented Heterogeneous AST Representation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.05779.

- For **OMPQA**:
  > This dataset is newly created by the authors, so it may not have a formal citation yet, but I will note that it is part of their contributions in this paper.

Now, I will compile the information about each dataset, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
