To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient estimation of the ANOVA mean dimension, with an application to neural net classification" by Christopher R. Hoyt and Art B. Owen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions an application to the **MNIST dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any specific details about the datasets used. In the introduction, the authors state that they consider the mean dimension of a neural network classifier of digits from the **MNIST dataset**. This confirms that the MNIST dataset is indeed used in their analysis.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MNIST dataset, stating that it consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, size-normalized and centered within 28 × 28 pixel grayscale images. This description gives me the necessary details about the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is as follows:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A dataset consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, size-normalized and centered within 28 × 28 pixel grayscale images.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset information along with its citation.
