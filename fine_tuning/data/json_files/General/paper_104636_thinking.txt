To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Demystifying Representation Learning with Non-contrastive Self-supervision" by Xiang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on several datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, and ImageNet** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including any specific characteristics or configurations mentioned.

1. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is also used for image classification tasks and is more challenging than CIFAR-10 due to the increased number of classes.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset consists of 10 classes and contains 13,000 labeled images, with 5,000 training images and 8,000 unlabeled images. It is designed for developing unsupervised feature learning algorithms.

4. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images across thousands of categories. It is widely used for training deep learning models and is known for its complexity and diversity.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Coates, A., Ng, A. Y., & Lee, H. (2011). *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., & Fei-Fei, L. (2009). *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for easy reference and further use.
