To extract datasets from the research paper titled "2-Level 3-Way Hardware-Software Co-Verification for the Mapping of Deep Learning Architecture (DLA) onto FPGA Boards" by Tolulope A. Odetola, Katie M. Groves, and Syed Rafay Hasan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets that are crucial for their experiments. This section often outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include dataset details.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their characteristics, such as size, type, and the specific tasks they are used for. 

The **experimental validation section** is particularly important as it typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methodologies. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate that the authors may have used datasets related to deep learning architectures, such as the **MNIST dataset** for the LeNet DLA and the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for the Caffe-inspired DLA. I will confirm this by checking the relevant sections.

Once I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: 
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding.
