To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAT-ViL: Co-Attention Gated Vision-Language Embedding for Visual Question Localized-Answering in Robotic Surgery" by Long Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conduct experimental validation on public surgical videos from the **MICCAI EndoVis Challenge 2017 and 2018**, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **EndoVis 2018 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14 robotic surgery videos from the MICCAI Endoscopic Vision Challenge 2018. The authors mention that the VQLA annotations are publicly accessible, and they provide specific details about the training and test sets, including the number of frames and QA pairs.

2. **EndoVis 2017 Dataset**: This dataset is also from the MICCAI Endoscopic Vision Challenge, specifically the 2017 edition. The authors describe how they manually selected and annotated frames with common organs, tools, and interactions, generating a specific number of frames and QA pairs for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **EndoVis 2018 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Kondo, S., Bodenstedt, S., Leger, S., Kadkhodamohammadi, R., Luengo, I., Fuentes, F., Flouty, E., Mohammed, A., Pedersen, M., et al. (2020). *2018 robotic scene segmentation challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.11190.

- For the **EndoVis 2017 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Shvets, A., Kurmann, T., Zhang, Z., Duggal, R., Su, Y.H., Rieke, N., Laina, I., Kalavakonda, N., et al. (2019). *2017 robotic instrument segmentation challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.06426.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective citation, which is crucial for proper attribution in any subsequent work.
