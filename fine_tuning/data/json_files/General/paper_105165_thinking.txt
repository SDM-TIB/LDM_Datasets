To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble of Averages: Improving Model Selection and Boosting Performance in Domain Generalization" by Devansh Arpit et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on the **DomainBed benchmark**, which suggests that this benchmark may include multiple datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using several datasets, including:

1. **PACS Dataset**: This dataset consists of images from four domains (Art, Cartoon, Photo, and Sketch) and is commonly used for domain generalization tasks.
2. **VLCS Dataset**: This dataset includes images from four different domains (Caltech101, LabelMe, Sun09, and VOC2007).
3. **OfficeHome Dataset**: This dataset contains images from four domains (Art, Clipart, Product, and RealWorld).
4. **TerraIncognita Dataset**: This dataset includes images from four domains (L100, L38, L43, and L46).
5. **DomainNet Dataset**: This dataset consists of six domains (Clip, Info, Paint, Quick, Real, and Sketch).

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- **PACS Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help in maintaining clarity and accuracy in the extraction process.
