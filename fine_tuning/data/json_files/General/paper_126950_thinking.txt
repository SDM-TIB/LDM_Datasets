To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaNtLE: Model-agnostic Natural Language Explainer" by Rakesh R Menon et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they evaluate MaNtLE on the **CLUES-Real benchmark**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, and I will need to find more details about it.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 6, where they mention using three structured classification tasks:

1. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is used to predict income levels based on various features.
2. **Recidivism Dataset**: This dataset is used to predict whether a convict is likely to re-commit crimes, as referenced from Schmidt and Witte (1988).
3. **Travel Insurance Dataset**: This dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is used to predict whether a traveler will purchase travel insurance.

In section 6.2, the authors provide more context about these datasets, confirming their use in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Adult Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dheeru Dua and Casey Graff. *UCI machine learning repository*. 2017.

- For the **Recidivism Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Schmidt and Ann D Witte. *Predicting recidivism in North Carolina, 1978 and 1980*. Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.

- For the **Travel Insurance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Tejashvi. *Travel insurance prediction data*. 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for any further analysis or replication of the study.
