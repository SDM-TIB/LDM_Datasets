To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Directed Acyclic Graph Factorization Machines for CTR Prediction via Knowledge Distillation" by Zhen Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **four real-world datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present in the paper. I will note this down as a key point.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors provide a summary of the datasets in **Table 1**, which lists the datasets used along with their statistics. The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Criteo**: A popular CTR prediction benchmark dataset containing user logs over a period of 7 days.
2. **Avazu**: Another dataset containing user logs over a period of 7 days, used in the Avazu CTR prediction competition.
3. **MovieLens-1M**: A well-known dataset for recommendation systems research.
4. **WeChat**: A dataset collected from the WeChat platform, which includes data from over one hundred million daily active users.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper or from known sources if they are not explicitly cited in the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **Criteo**, the citation is:
  > Criteo. *Kaggle Display Advertising Challenge Dataset*. Available at: http://labs.criteo.com/2014/02/kaggle-display-advertising-challenge-dataset.

- For **Avazu**, the citation is:
  > Avazu. *Avazu CTR Prediction Dataset*. Available at: http://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction.

- For **MovieLens-1M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens 1M Dataset*. Available at: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens.

- For **WeChat**, the citation is:
  > WeChat. *WeChat Official Account Platform Data*. Available at: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/.

After collecting this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, ensuring that I maintain clarity and accuracy in the details provided.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
