To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sparsifying Sparse Representations for Passage Retrieval by Top-k Masking" by Jheng-Hong Yang, Xueguang Ma, and Jimmy Lin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method improves effectiveness on the **MS MARCO passage ranking test collection**, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They specifically mention using the **MS MARCO passage corpus** for their experiments. This section provides details about the evaluation protocols and the dataset's characteristics.

In the **References section**, I will find the full citation for the MS MARCO dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> P. Bajaj, D. Campos, N. Craswell, L. Deng, J. Gao, X. Liu, R. Majumder, A. McNamara, B. Mitra, T. Nguyen, M. Rosenberg, X. Song, A. Stoica, S. Tiwary, and T. Wang. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. arXiv:1611.09268v3, 2018.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details. The **MS MARCO passage corpus** is a dataset used for passage ranking tasks, consisting of human-generated queries and corresponding passages.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
