To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quality versus speed in energy demand prediction for district heating systems" by Witold Andrzejewski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their algorithms on a real-world dataset from a district heating system in Poland. This indicates that there is at least one dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (DHS Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they provide a detailed account of the dataset, including the number of counters, the time period covered, and the types of data collected. The dataset comprises heat measurements from 28 hot water and 83 heat energy counters, covering the period from September 1, 2015, to February 28, 2019. This section is crucial as it provides the necessary details about the dataset.

The authors also mention that the dataset is made public for research purposes and provide a link to access it. This is important for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors refer to the dataset in reference [17], which is a URL pointing to a webpage that hosts the dataset. The citation for this dataset is as follows:
> Test dataset. Real data sets on district-heating systems energy consumption. https://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/rwrembel/energy-cons-data.html, 2022.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction as follows:

1. **DHS Dataset**: This dataset includes heat measurements from 28 hot water and 83 heat energy counters in a district heating system in Poland, covering the period from September 1, 2015, to February 28, 2019. It contains measurement timestamps, energy consumption, weather conditions, type of day, and season. The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.

   Full citation:
   > Test dataset. Real data sets on district-heating systems energy consumption. https://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/rwrembel/energy-cons-data.html, 2022.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details into a structured format for further processing or review.
