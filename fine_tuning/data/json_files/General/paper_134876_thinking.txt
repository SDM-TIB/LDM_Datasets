To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Aligned CLIP for Few-shot Classification" by Muhammad Waleed Gondal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions benchmarking on "11 widely used image classification tasks," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, widely used in the computer vision community.
2. **UCF101**: A dataset of 101 human action classes from videos in the wild.
3. **Caltech101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories.
4. **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft.
5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
6. **Flowers102**: A dataset for flower classification with 102 categories.
7. **StanfordCars**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of cars.
8. **DTD**: A dataset for describing textures in the wild.
9. **Food101**: A dataset containing images of food items across 101 categories.
10. **OxfordPets**: A dataset for pet classification with images of cats and dogs.
11. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited for future reference.
