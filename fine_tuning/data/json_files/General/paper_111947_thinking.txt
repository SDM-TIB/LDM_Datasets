To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Class of Low-Complexity DCT-like Transforms for Image and Video Coding" by T. L. T. da Silveira et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any references to datasets used in the context of image and video coding experiments. The authors may mention datasets for still-image compression or video coding, which are crucial for validating their proposed methods.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors refer to a dataset like the "USC-SIPI Image Database," I will ensure to note the full citation as follows:
> USC-SIPI, The USC-SIPI Image Database, 2011. University of Southern California, Signal and Image Processing Institute.

If they mention any other datasets, I will follow the same process to extract their full citations.

Finally, I will compile all the identified datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
