To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EigenDamage: Structured Pruning in the Kronecker-Factored Eigenbasis" by Chaoqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to identify any specific datasets mentioned. If the authors reference datasets used for training or evaluation, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. This is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, test).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which might be something like:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009.

If they mention another dataset, such as **Tiny-ImageNet**, I would find its citation as well, which could be:
> Tiny-ImageNet. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Available at: https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
