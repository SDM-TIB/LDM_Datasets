To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AWNet: Attentive Wavelet Network for Image ISP" by Linhui Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets utilized in their research. In this section, I will look for explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of images, types of images, and how they were used in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention the **Zurich dataset** from the AIM 2020 Learned Smartphone ISP Challenge, which consists of 48,043 RAW-RGB image pairs. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, and I will note the specifics provided, such as the training and testing splits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Zurich dataset. The citation is essential for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, conference or journal name, and publication year.

The citation for the Zurich dataset is:
> Ignatov, A., Timofte, R., et al. *AIM 2020 challenge on learned image signal processing pipeline*. In: European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for any further processing or review, ensuring that all extracted information is accurate and well-organized.
