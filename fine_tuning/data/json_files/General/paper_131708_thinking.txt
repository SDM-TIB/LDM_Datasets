To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of NetOps Capability of Pre-trained Large Language Models," I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the creation of **NetEval**, an evaluation set for measuring the capabilities of LLMs in Network Operations (NetOps). This indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Evaluation Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe **NetEval**, which consists of over 5,732 questions about NetOps, covering various sub-domains. This section will likely contain the specifics I need for the dataset description.

Within **section 2.1 (Multi-choice Evaluation Set)**, the authors elaborate on the construction of the dataset, stating that it includes 5,269 multiple-choice questions sourced from certification exams and other relevant materials. They also mention that the dataset is multilingual, with questions in both English and Chinese.

In **section 2.2 (Non-multi-choice Evaluation Set)**, the authors discuss an additional collection of 463 non-multi-choice questions, which were generated through various methods, including rule-based filtering and using GPT-4 for extraction. This section confirms the existence of another dataset component.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper cites the following sources relevant to the dataset:

1. For **NetEval**, the citation is:
   > Miao, Y., Bai, Y., Ren, Y., Sun, D., Wang, X., Luo, Z., Xiang, C., Li, X., Chen, L., Sun, H., Zhang, Q., Li, D., Xu, X. (2023). *An Empirical Study of NetOps Capability of Pre-trained Large Language Models*. [arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.XXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.XXXX).

2. For the **Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)** dataset, which is referenced in the context of comparison, the citation is:
   > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2020). *Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately represent the datasets extracted from the paper.
