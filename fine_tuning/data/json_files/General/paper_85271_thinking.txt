To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Association rule mining and itemset-correlation based variants" by Niels MÃ¼ndler, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the apriori algorithm and its variations but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **sections that describe the algorithms and examples**. In the introduction, the author discusses the application of association rules in the context of shopping behavior, but again, no specific datasets are named. 

I will then look for any **examples or case studies** that might include datasets. In the section titled "Example," there is a mention of a transaction database for a market, which includes items like Aubergine, Beer, Charcoal, etc. However, this is more of a hypothetical example rather than a reference to a specific dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily consist of foundational papers on association rule mining, such as those by Agrawal and Srikant, but they do not provide specific datasets either.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets with full citations, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper. The examples provided are illustrative and do not refer to actual datasets with citations.

2. **References to foundational works** in association rule mining are present, but they do not include datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper discusses algorithms and concepts related to association rule mining, it does not provide specific datasets or their citations. Therefore, I will note that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.
