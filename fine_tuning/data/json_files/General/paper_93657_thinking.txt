To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Language Models as Few-Shot Learner for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems" by Andrea Madotto et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the evaluation of language models on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention several models and approaches related to task-oriented dialogue systems, but I need to look for specific datasets. The introduction also references prior work, which may include dataset names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets along with their descriptions.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SNIPS Dataset**: Used for evaluating the SLOT-FILLING and INTENT recognition tasks. This dataset is known for its application in natural language understanding tasks.

2. **MultiWoZ Dataset**: Utilized for evaluating the Dialogue State Tracking (DST) and ACT tasks. This dataset is a large-scale multi-domain dialogue dataset that has been widely used in dialogue system research.

3. **FewShotWOZ Dataset**: Mentioned for evaluating the Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. This dataset is specifically designed for few-shot learning in dialogue systems.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SNIPS Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MultiWoZ Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **FewShotWOZ Dataset**, the citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
