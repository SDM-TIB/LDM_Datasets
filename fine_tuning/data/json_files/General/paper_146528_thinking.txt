To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIPVQA: Video Quality Assessment via CLIP" by Fengchuang Xing et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments were conducted on **eight in-the-wild video datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to identify them.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** within the paper. In this case, the datasets are summarized in **Table V**, which provides detailed information about each dataset used in the experiments. I will extract the names of the datasets along with their descriptions, including the year of publication, total number of unique contents, resolution, frame rate, and mean opinion score (MOS) range.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
