To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Histo-Genomic Knowledge Distillation For Cancer Prognosis From Histopathology Whole Slide Images" by Zhikang Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarking datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention five cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA):

1. **Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma (BLCA)**
2. **Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA)**
3. **Glioblastoma & Lower Grade Glioma (GBMLGG)**
4. **Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD)**
5. **Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC)**

The authors provide details about the datasets, including the context of their use in cancer prognosis and the specific analyses performed.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The datasets are derived from TCGA, which is a well-known resource, and the citation for TCGA is typically as follows:

- **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**: 
  > The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. *The Cancer Genome Atlas*. Available at: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for TCGA as the source of the datasets used in the study.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format that highlights the names of the datasets and their respective citations, ready for further processing or review.
