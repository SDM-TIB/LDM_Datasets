To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Objects with Context-Likelihood Graphs and Graph Refinement" by Aritra Bhowmik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on the **Visual Genome** and **MS-COCO** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. Here, they specify that they use the **Visual Genome** dataset in two configurations: **VG1000** and **VG3000**, which correspond to the 1000 and 3000 most frequent object categories, respectively. They also mention the **MS-COCO 2017** dataset, which is another key dataset for their experiments.

In section 4.1, the authors provide specific details about the **Visual Genome** dataset, stating that it contains 92.9K images split into 87.9K for training and 5K for testing. They also mention that they use synsets as class labels due to inconsistent label annotations. For the **MS-COCO** dataset, they note that it includes 118K images for training and 5K for evaluation, with 80 object categories.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Visual Genome Dataset**:
   > Ranjay Krishna, Yuke Zhu, Oliver Groth, Justin Johnson, Kenji Hata, Joshua Kravitz, Stephanie Chen, Yannis Kalantidis, Li-Jia Li, David A Shamma, et al. *Visual Genome: Connecting language and vision using crowdsourced dense image annotations*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):32–73, 2017.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Visual Genome**: A dataset containing dense annotations of images, including object instances, attributes, and relationships. The authors utilize two configurations: VG1000 and VG3000, based on the most frequent object categories.

- **MS-COCO**: A widely used dataset for object detection, containing images with multiple object instances and annotations for 80 object categories.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
