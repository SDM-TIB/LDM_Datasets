To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Face Pyramid Vision Transformer" by K. Islam, M. Zaigham Zaheer, and A. Mahmood, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed FPVT is evaluated on **seven benchmark datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of face recognition (FR) and mention the need for large-scale datasets. They also reference a dataset with **4M identities and 260M face images**, which suggests the importance of datasets in their research.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that lists the datasets used for training and testing. The authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Face Scrub Dataset**: Contains 107,818 images of 265 male and 265 female celebrities, with a cleaned version used for training that includes 91,712 images of 263 males and 263 females.

2. **LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild)**: Comprises 13,233 images of faces gathered from online sources, used for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments.

3. **CA-LFW (Cross-Age LFW)**: Contains 3,000 positive face aging pairs, split into 10 distinct folds with 4,025 individuals.

4. **CP-LFW (Cross-Pose LFW)**: An extended version of LFW with 11,652 face images and 3,968 unique identities.

5. **Age-DB**: A manually collected dataset containing 16,488 images of various individuals, with 568 unique identities.

6. **CFP-FP (Frontal Profile)**: Contains 7,000 face images of 500 unique identities, split into subsets for experiments.

7. **VGG2-FP**: Extracted from the VGGFace2 dataset, specifically designed for frontal-profiles, containing 10,000 images of 300 identities.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. Here are the citations I will include:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
