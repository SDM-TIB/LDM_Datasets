To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AUGSPLICING: Synchronized Behavior Detection in Streaming Tensors" by Jiabao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the detection of synchronized behavior in streaming tensors, and the introduction provides context for the problem but does not explicitly mention datasets yet.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention several datasets, specifically in Table 2, which lists the data statistics for the datasets used in their experiments.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset consists of rating data with dimensions 468K × 73.3K × 0.73K and contains 1.34 million edges.
2. **BeerAdvocate Dataset**: This dataset has dimensions 26.5K × 50.8K × 0.5K and contains 1.08 million edges.
3. **App Dataset**: This dataset includes mobile devices, apps, installing time, and uninstalling time with dimensions 2.47M × 17.9K × 30 × 30, totaling 5.43 million edges.
4. **Wi-Fi Dataset**: This dataset consists of device IPs, Wi-Fi APs, connecting time, and disconnecting time with dimensions 119.4K × 0.84K × 1.46K × 1.46K, totaling 6.42 million edges.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets used, as they are likely publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that the authors mention that the datasets are publicly available, but I will not be able to provide formal citations for them.

Next, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as dimensions and the number of edges.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that I have accurately captured the information from the paper.
