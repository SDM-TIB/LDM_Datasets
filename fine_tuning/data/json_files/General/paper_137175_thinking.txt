To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "EAT: Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Efficient Audio Transformer" by Wenxi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the Efficient Audio Transformer (EAT) achieves state-of-the-art performance on several audio-related tasks, including specific datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains information about the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention the datasets they used for their experiments:

1. **AudioSet (AS-2M, AS-20K)**: The authors describe AudioSet as comprising approximately two million YouTube video audio clips, spanning 527 classes. They processed 1,912,134 clips for the unbalanced set (AS-2M) and 20,550 clips for the balanced set (AS-20K).

2. **Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50)**: This dataset consists of 2,000 audio clips, each five seconds long, distributed across 50 semantic classes.

3. **Speech Commands V2 (SPC-2)**: This dataset is used for a keyword-spotting task in speech recognition, comprising 84,843 training recordings, 9,981 validation recordings, and 11,005 testing recordings.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For **AudioSet**, the citation is:
  > Jort Gemmeke, Daniel Ellis, Dylan Freedman, Aren Jansen, et al. *Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2017.

- For **ESC-50**, the citation is:
  > Karol J. Piczak. *ESC: Dataset for environmental sound classification*. In Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM), 2015.

- For **Speech Commands V2**, the citation is:
  > Pete Warden. *Speech commands: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.03209, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research.
