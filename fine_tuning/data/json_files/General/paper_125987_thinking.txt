To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Calibration of Local Volatility Models with Stochastic Interest Rates using Optimal Transport" by Grégoire Loeper, Jan Obłój, and Benjamin Joseph, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for calibration or testing.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets that are critical to their methodology or results. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

I will then examine the **methodology section** to identify any datasets used in the calibration process. This section often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will look for any references to datasets that were used to validate the findings. The authors may discuss the performance of their model on specific datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their results.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Hull-White model" or "Cox model," I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets in detail. I will ensure to capture the full citation format as required.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing full citations for each to maintain academic integrity.
