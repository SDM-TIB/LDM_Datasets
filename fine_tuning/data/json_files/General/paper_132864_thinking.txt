To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Kernel-based function learning in dynamic and non-stationary environments" by Alberto Giaretta, Mauro Bisiacco, and Gianluigi Pillonetto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the problem of reconstructing an unknown function from noisy data, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiment section (Section 4)**, as this is likely where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they generated input locations from different probability densities and collected output data. Specifically, they describe using three truncated Gaussian distributions to generate the input locations and the corresponding output data.

The details provided indicate that:
1. The first set of 1000 input locations was generated using the first density (green curve).
2. The second set of 2000 input locations was generated using the second density (red curve).
3. The output data followed a model with Gaussian noise.

I will now look for the **full citations** for the datasets mentioned. Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or references, I will need to create citations based on the context provided in the paper. The authors do not reference any external datasets but rather describe their own generated data.

For the datasets, I will summarize them as follows:
- **Dataset 1**: Generated from the first truncated Gaussian distribution, consisting of 1000 input-output pairs.
- **Dataset 2**: Generated from the second truncated Gaussian distribution, consisting of 2000 input-output pairs.

Since these datasets are generated by the authors and do not have formal citations, I will note that they are original datasets created for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset descriptions and any relevant citations, even if they are self-referential.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing the necessary citations and descriptions.
