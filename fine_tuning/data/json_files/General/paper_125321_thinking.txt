To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explaining, Analyzing, and Probing Representations of Self-Supervised Learning Models for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition" by Bulat Khaertdinov and Stylianos Asteriadis, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two single-device datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MobiAct Dataset**: This dataset contains data collected from 61 subjects using smartphones placed in their pockets, encompassing 11 daily activities. The authors reference the dataset as [34] in the references.

2. **UCI-HAR Dataset**: This dataset is acquired using smartphones equipped with IMUs placed on the waists of subjects, involving 30 subjects performing 6 basic activities of daily living. The authors cite this dataset as [2] in the references.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **MobiAct Dataset**, the citation is:
  > G. Vavoulas, C. Chatzaki, T. Malliotakis, M. Pediaditis, and M. Tsiknakis. *The MobiAct Dataset: Recognition of Activities of Daily Living Using Smartphones*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Ageing Well and e-Health - Volume 1: ICT4AWE, pages 143–151, 2016.

- For the **UCI-HAR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Anguita, A. Ghio, L. Oneto, X. Parra, and J. Reyes. *A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones*. In Proceedings of the 21st International European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, pages 437–442, 2013.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **MobiAct Dataset**: Collected from 61 subjects using smartphones, containing 11 daily activities.
   - Citation: G. Vavoulas, C. Chatzaki, T. Malliotakis, M. Pediaditis, and M. Tsiknakis. *The MobiAct Dataset: Recognition of Activities of Daily Living Using Smartphones*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Ageing Well and e-Health - Volume 1: ICT4AWE, pages 143–151, 2016.

2. **UCI-HAR Dataset**: Acquired using smartphones with IMUs, involving 30 subjects performing 6 basic activities.
   - Citation: D. Anguita, A. Ghio, L. Oneto, X. Parra, and J. Reyes. *A Public Domain Dataset for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones*. In Proceedings of the 21st International European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, pages 437–442, 2013.

With this information, I can now proceed to compile the dataset entries in the required format for further processing or review.
