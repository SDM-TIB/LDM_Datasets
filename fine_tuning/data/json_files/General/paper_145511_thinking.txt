To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System for Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge" by Federico Costa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge, which suggests that there are datasets involved. The introduction provides context about the challenge and hints at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the database used for their experiments. Here, they specifically mention the **MSP-Podcast dataset**, which is crucial for the emotion recognition tasks they conducted. The authors describe this dataset as containing speech segments obtained from audio-sharing websites, annotated with emotional labels.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MSP-Podcast dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **MSP-Podcast dataset**:
  > Reza Lotfian and Carlos Busso. *Building naturalistic emotionally balanced speech corpus by retrieving emotional speech from existing podcast recordings*. IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, vol. 10, no. 4, pp. 471â€“483, 2017.

Since the paper primarily discusses this dataset, I will ensure to include it in my final output.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that the full citation is included as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
