To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coreference-aware Double-channel Attention Network for Multi-party Dialogue Reading Comprehension" by Yanling Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimentation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark corpora, specifically **Molweni** and **FriendsQA**. This indicates that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look into **section IV (Experimentation)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets. Here, they explicitly state that they utilized two benchmark datasets:

1. **Molweni**: This dataset is described as the first MDRC dataset that annotates the discourse dependency structure of dialogues, derived from the Ubuntu Chat Corpus. It contains an average of 3.51 interlocutors per dialogue and includes both answerable and unanswerable questions.

2. **FriendsQA**: This dataset is a question-answering dataset extracted from the TV show "Friends." It consists of colloquial everyday conversations and contains 1,222 dialogues with 10,610 answerable extractive questions. Unlike Molweni, FriendsQA does not provide ground-truth annotations of discourse dependency structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Molweni**, the citation is:
  > J. Li, M. Liu, M.-Y. Kan, Z. Zheng, Z. Wang, W. Lei, T. Liu, and B. Qin. *Molweni: A challenge multiparty dialogues-based machine reading comprehension dataset with discourse structure*. In Proceedings of the 28th COLING, 2020, pp. 2642–2652.

- For **FriendsQA**, the citation is:
  > Z. Yang and J. D. Choi. *FriendsQA: Open-domain question answering on TV show transcripts*. In Proceedings of the 20th SIGDIAL, 2019, pp. 188–197.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
