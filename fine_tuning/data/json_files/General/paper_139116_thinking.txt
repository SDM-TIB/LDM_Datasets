To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ToolSword: Unveiling Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Tool Learning Across Three Stages" by Junjie Ye et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **11 open-source and closed-source LLMs**, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these models.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used, such as **section 2 (ToolSword)** and **section 3 (Experiments)**. In these sections, the authors describe various safety scenarios and the models evaluated, but I need to confirm if they explicitly mention datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors refer to **Advbench** as a dataset used for testing malicious queries, which is crucial for my extraction. They also mention that they randomly selected **55 queries from Advbench** for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Advbench dataset. The citation is as follows:
- For **Advbench**, the citation is:
  > Andy Zou, Zifan Wang, J. Zico Kolter, and Matt Fredrikson. *Universal and transferable adversarial attacks on aligned language models*. CoRR, abs/2307.15043, 2023.

Additionally, I will note that the paper discusses various safety scenarios but does not introduce new datasets beyond those referenced. Therefore, I will compile the findings into a structured format.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Advbench**: A dataset used for testing malicious queries in the context of evaluating LLMs.

Now, I will prepare the final output with the dataset details and citations.
