To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting key Soccer match events to create highlights using Computer Vision" by Narayana Darapaneni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview of the research focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for automatic highlight generation in soccer matches, which suggests that they likely used specific datasets for their model training. However, I need to find explicit mentions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 3 (Methodology and approach)**, where the authors describe the creation of a training set of images for key events in soccer matches. They mention the following classes of events and the number of images collected for each:

1. **Foul**: 27 images
2. **Corner kick**: 89 images
3. **Goal**: 57 images
4. **Penalty kick**: 81 images

This indicates that the authors created a custom dataset consisting of 254 annotated images for training their models.

In **section 3.1 (Dataset used for the Analysis)**, the authors elaborate on the significant moments they aimed to capture, which further confirms the focus on specific events in soccer matches. However, they do not mention any publicly available datasets or external sources, indicating that their dataset is likely proprietary or created specifically for this study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** for any relevant citations that might pertain to datasets or methodologies used in their research. However, it appears that the authors primarily reference literature related to methodologies and previous works rather than specific datasets.

Since the authors did not provide full citations for any external datasets, I will document the custom dataset they created for their study, noting the classes and the number of images for each class. The citation for the paper itself will be included as the source of this dataset.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Narayana Darapaneni, Prashant Kumar, Nikhil Malhotra, Vigneswaran Sundaramurthy, Abhaya Thakur, Shivam Chauhan, Krishna Chaitanya Thangeda, Anwesh Reddy Paduri. *Detecting key Soccer match events to create highlights using Computer Vision*. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
