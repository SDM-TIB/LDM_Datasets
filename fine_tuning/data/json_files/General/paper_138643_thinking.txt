To extract datasets from the research paper titled "3D Printer-Controlled Syringe Pumps for Dual, Active, Regulable and Simultaneous Dispensing of Reagents" by Gabriel Siano et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the manufacturing process of lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) and mention the use of various reagents and techniques. However, I need to look for specific datasets related to the experiments conducted.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section**, particularly subsection 2.6 (Serum samples), where the authors mention the use of two sera classified as positive and negative controls provided by a specific laboratory. This indicates that there is a dataset related to serum samples used in their experiments.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional datasets that may have been generated or analyzed during the study. The authors describe the dispensing of reagents and the evaluation of LFIA, which may involve quantitative data that could be considered a dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. For example, the serum samples were provided by the Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia de Leptospirosis (LNRL), and I will need to cite this appropriately.

Now, I will compile the identified datasets along with their full citations. The key datasets I have identified so far include:

1. **Positive Control Serum Samples**: Provided by the Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia de Leptospirosis (LNRL), Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER), Santa Fe, Argentina. The use of these samples was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Facultad de Bioquímica y Ciencias Biológicas of the Universidad Nacional del Litoral (CE2019-37, Acta 05/19).

2. **Negative Control Serum Samples**: Also provided by the same laboratory as the positive control samples.

I will ensure that I accurately document the full citations for these datasets, as they are crucial for proper attribution and reproducibility in research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are included.
