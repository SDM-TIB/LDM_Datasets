To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: Improving DNN-based Music Source Separation" by Ryosuke Sawata et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of music source separation and mention various methods, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention the **MUSDB18 dataset** in the experiments section, which is crucial for their evaluation of the proposed methods.

The paper describes the MUSDB18 dataset as follows:
- It consists of 150 songs recorded at a 44.1-kHz sampling rate, with each song containing a mixture and its four sources: bass, drums, other, and vocals. The dataset is split into "train" and "test" subsets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MUSDB18 dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Z. Rafii, A. Liutkus, F.-R. St√∂ter, S. I. Mimilakis, and R. Bittner. *The MUSDB18 corpus for music separation*. Dec. 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset extraction process:
1. Identify the relevant sections of the paper (abstract, introduction, experiments).
2. Locate the specific datasets mentioned (MUSDB18).
3. Gather details about the datasets (number of songs, sampling rate, sources).
4. Retrieve the full citation from the references.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
