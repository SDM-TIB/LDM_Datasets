To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Diffusion Models with 3D Perspective Geometry Constraints" by Rishi Upadhyay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a novel geometric constraint in training generative models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. The introduction may provide context on the datasets used, so I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior works that might include datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention using the **HoliCity dataset** for fine-tuning their model, which consists of 50,078 real images taken in London along with ground truth vanishing points for each image. This is a clear dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, they refer to the **SYNTHIA-AL** dataset, which includes depth and semantic segmentation information for images of a synthetic city, and the **Virtual KITTI 2** dataset, which is a photorealistic copy of the popular KITTI dataset. Both of these datasets are used for generating synthetic images conditioned on depth maps.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **HoliCity Dataset**:
   > Zhou, Y., Huang, J., Dai, X., Luo, L., Chen, Z., & Ma, Y. (2020). HoliCity: A City-Scale Data Platform for Learning Holistic 3D Structures. arXiv:2008.03286 [cs.CV].

2. **SYNTHIA Dataset**:
   > Ros, G., Sellart, L., Materzynska, J., Vazquez, D., & Lopez, A. M. (2016). The SYNTHIA Dataset: A Large Collection of Synthetic Images for Semantic Segmentation of Urban Scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 3234â€“3243.

3. **Virtual KITTI 2 Dataset**:
   > Cabon, Y., Murray, N., & Humenberger, M. (2020). Virtual KITTI 2. arXiv:2001.10773 [cs.CV].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
