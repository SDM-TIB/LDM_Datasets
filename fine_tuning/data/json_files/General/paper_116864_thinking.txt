To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of stationarity regions in measured non-WSSUS 60 GHz mmWave V2V channels" by Danilo Radovic et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channels and their characteristics, which may hint at the data used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **measurement scenarios section** (Section III) and the **results section** (Section V). In these sections, the authors describe the measurement setup, including the frequency, resolution, and the urban environment where the data was collected. They mention that the measurements were taken at a frequency of 60 GHz with specific parameters, which indicates that the data is likely derived from these experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion section** for any summaries or references to datasets used in the analysis. The authors discuss the characteristics of the channels and the results of their measurements, which may include references to the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

For example, if the paper references specific datasets or measurement campaigns, I will ensure to extract the full citation for each. If the authors refer to their own measurements, I will note the details provided in the text, such as the parameters of the measurements and the context in which they were taken.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the full citations, into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's details, ensuring that all necessary information is included for future reference or analysis.
