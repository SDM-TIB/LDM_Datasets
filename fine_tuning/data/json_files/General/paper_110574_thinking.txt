To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ultra-marginal Feature Importance: Learning from Data with Causal Guarantees" by Joseph Janssen, Vincent Guan, and Elina Robeva, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their analyses. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **BRCA dataset** for their experiments. I will note the specifics provided about this dataset, such as the number of features, the type of data (e.g., gene expression data), and the context in which it was used (e.g., breast cancer classification).

Additionally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For the **BRCA dataset**, I will find the citation:
- Tomczak, K., Czerwińska, P., & Wiznerowicz, M. (2015). The cancer genome atlas (TCGA): An immeasurable source of knowledge. *Contemporary Oncology*, 19(1A), A68.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the paper, such as the **CAMELS dataset** used in the hydrology experiments. I will extract the relevant details and citation for this dataset as well.

For the **CAMELS dataset**, the citation is:
- Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N., & Clark, M. P. (2017). The CAMELS data set: Catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies. *Hydrology and Earth System Sciences*, 21(10), 5293–5313.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
