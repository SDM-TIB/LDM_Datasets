To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BN-NAS: Neural Architecture Search with Batch Normalization" by Boyu Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on **ImageNet**, which suggests that this is a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on **ImageNet**, providing details about the number of training and validation samples. This confirms that ImageNet is a primary dataset used in their research.

I will also check the **related works** and **methodology sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced, but it appears that the focus is primarily on ImageNet for their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the ImageNet dataset. The citation for ImageNet is as follows:
> Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: ImageNet
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset with 1.28 million training samples and 50,000 validation samples, used for image classification tasks.
   - **Full Citation**: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2009.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
