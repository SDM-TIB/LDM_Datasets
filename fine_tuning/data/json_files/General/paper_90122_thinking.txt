To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Vision-Dialog Navigation by Exploring Cross-modal Memory" by Yi Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on the **CVDN dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Settings)**, they explicitly state that they evaluate their model on the **CVDN dataset**, which collects 2050 human-human navigation dialogs and over 7,000 trajectories in 83 MatterPort houses. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its structure and purpose.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CVDN dataset. The authors reference the original source of the MatterPort dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The relevant citation is:

- For the **CVDN dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peter Anderson, Qi Wu, Damien Teney, Jake Bruce, Mark Johnson, Niko Sunderhauf, Ian Reid, Stephen Gould, and Anton van den Hengel. *Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments*. In 2018 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3674â€“3683, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details and ensure that I include the full citation for the CVDN dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all necessary details are included.
