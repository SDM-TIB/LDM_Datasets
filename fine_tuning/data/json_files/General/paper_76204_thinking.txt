To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Importance of Attention in Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Text Classification" by Xiang Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of **miniRCV1** and **miniReuters-21578** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5.2, the authors describe the **miniRCV1 dataset** as a smaller version of the RCV1 dataset, tailored for few-shot learning. They specify that it consists of two versions: one for single-label classification and another for multi-label classification. The authors provide details about how the dataset is constructed, including the number of documents sampled from each class.

For the **miniReuters-21578 dataset**, the authors mention that it is also a smaller version created for few-shot learning, with about 20 examples for each label. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **miniRCV1 dataset**, the citation is:
  > David D Lewis, Yiming Yang, Tony G Rose, and Fan Li. *RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research*. Journal of machine learning research, 5(Apr):361â€“397, 2004.

- For the **miniReuters-21578 dataset**, the citation is:
  > David D Lewis. *Reuters-21578 text categorization test collection*. 1997.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **miniRCV1 Dataset**: A smaller version of the RCV1 dataset, designed for few-shot text classification, consisting of single-label and multi-label classification tasks.
2. **miniReuters-21578 Dataset**: A smaller version of the Reuters-21578 dataset, also tailored for few-shot learning, with approximately 20 examples for each label.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output.
