To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detecting Wandering Behavior of People with Dementia" by Nicklas Sindlev Andersen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of GPS data for detecting wandering behavior, which suggests that there may be datasets related to GPS trajectories.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using **synthetically generated data** for their experiments, which is a key point. I will look for any specific details about this synthetic dataset, including how it was generated and its characteristics.

In the **case studies section**, the authors describe two case studies involving synthetic trajectories. They mention that the synthetic data was generated to simulate normal and anomalous trajectories, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments. I will note the details provided about the generation process, including the parameters used.

The authors also reference the **GeoLife Trajectory Dataset** released by Microsoft Research Asia as another dataset they considered, although they ultimately used synthetic data for their experiments. This is important to note as it provides context for the types of datasets relevant to their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors do not provide a formal citation for the synthetic data since it was generated as part of their research. However, they reference the method used for generating this data, which is based on the work by Hermoupolis. The citation for this method is:
   > N. Pelekis, S. Sideridis, P. Tampakis, and Y. Theodoridis. *Hermoupolis: A semantic trajectory generator in the data science era*. SIGSPATIAL Special, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 19â€“26, May 2015.

2. **GeoLife Trajectory Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Microsoft Research. *GeoLife Trajectory Dataset*. Available: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
