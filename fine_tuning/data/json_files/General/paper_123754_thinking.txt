To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Panoptic One-Click Segmentation: Applied to Agricultural Data" by Patrick Zimmer, Michael Halstead, and Chris McCool, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of "challenging sugar beet and corn image data," which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two specific datasets:

1. **SB20 (Sugar Beet 2020)**: This dataset consists of 71 training images, 37 validation images, and 35 evaluation images, with a total of 1424 plant instances in the training set. The images have a resolution of 640×480.

2. **CN20 (Corn 2020)**: This dataset includes 150 training images, 40 validation images, and 45 evaluation images, totaling 1781 plant objects for training. The images have a resolution of 1280×720, which is resized to 704×416 for the experiments.

In the same section, the authors provide details about the characteristics of these datasets, such as the presence of various weed species and the method of data collection using a robot equipped with a camera.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are likely original contributions of the authors and not previously published datasets, they may not have formal citations in the references. Instead, I will note that the datasets are described in detail within the paper itself.

Finally, I will compile the information about each dataset, ensuring to include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details, while also noting that they are original datasets created for this research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
