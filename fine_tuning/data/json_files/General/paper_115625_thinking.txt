To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SSL-WM: A Black-Box Watermarking Approach for Encoders Pre-trained by Self-Supervised Learning" by Peizhuo Lv et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors discuss the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention using **eight benchmark datasets** for their experiments, which is a strong indication that specific datasets will be detailed.

I will then compile the datasets mentioned in the **experiments section**:

1. **CIFAR-10**: An image classification dataset with 60,000 images in 10 classes.
2. **STL-10**: Contains 5,000 labeled training images and 8,000 labeled testing images, along with 100,000 unlabeled images in the same 10 classes as CIFAR-10.
3. **CINIC-10**: Constructed from ImageNet and CIFAR-10, containing 270,000 images in the same 10 classes as CIFAR-10.
4. **GTSRB**: A dataset containing 51,800 traffic sign images in 43 categories, commonly used for evaluating autonomous driving applications.
5. **WikiText-103**: A large corpus of text data collected from Wikipedia, containing approximately 103 million tokens.
6. **SNLI**: A dataset consisting of 570,000 sentence pairs labeled as “entailment”, “neutral”, or “contradiction”.
7. **MRPC**: A corpus with 5,801 sentence pairs, labeled as paraphrase or not.
8. **IMDB**: A movie reviews dataset for sentiment classification, with 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will look into the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**:

- **IMDB**:

Finally, I will compile all this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that each dataset is properly documented with its citation.
