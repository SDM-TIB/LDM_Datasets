To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Approximation of BV Functions by Neural Networks" by Benny Avelin and Vesa Julin, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss methodology and experiments**. The abstract provides a concise overview of the paper's focus, which may hint at the datasets used. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, potentially mentioning specific datasets.

Next, I will look for sections explicitly labeled as **"Datasets," "Experiments," or similar**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. I will pay close attention to any tables, figures, or references to datasets, as they often summarize key information.

While reviewing the paper, I will take note of any datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics described by the authors. For example, if the authors mention a dataset containing a certain number of samples or specific types of data, I will record that information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets used in the research. I will ensure to note the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper references existing datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources where these datasets were introduced or described. This may involve searching for the dataset names in academic databases or online repositories.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The dataset name.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its size and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset, formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper, complete with necessary citations for future reference.
