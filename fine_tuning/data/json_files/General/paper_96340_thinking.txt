To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ADMM-Net for Communication Interference Removal in Stepped-Frequency Radar" by Jeremy Johnston et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used "random data generated according to the radar and communication signal models" for training the network. This suggests that there may not be publicly available datasets but rather synthetic data generated for the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to see if there are any specific datasets mentioned. The authors describe the training data generation process, which involves creating complex-valued ground truth data and corresponding measurements based on a statistical signal model. However, they do not reference any external datasets or benchmarks.

Since the paper does not cite any publicly available datasets, I will look into the **References section** to see if any related works or datasets are mentioned that could be relevant to the experiments. However, the references primarily discuss theoretical frameworks and previous works in radar and communication systems rather than specific datasets.

In conclusion, while the paper describes the generation of synthetic datasets for training, it does not provide citations for any external datasets. Therefore, I will note that the datasets used are not publicly available and are generated based on the authors' models.

I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Data**: The authors generated random data based on radar and communication signal models for training the ADMM-Net.
2. **No Public Datasets**: There are no publicly available datasets cited in the paper.

Since there are no external datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries in the specified format. Instead, I will document the nature of the data used in the experiments as synthetic and generated by the authors.
