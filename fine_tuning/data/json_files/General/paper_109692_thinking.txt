To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CAD: Co-Adapting Discriminative Features for Improved Few-Shot Classification" by Philip Chikontwe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used in previous work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention four datasets:

1. **miniImageNet**: This dataset consists of a subset of 100 object classes from ImageNet, with 600 images per class. The authors follow the setting proposed by Ravi et al. (2017) for their experiments.

2. **tieredImageNet**: This is a larger subset of ImageNet, containing 351 training classes, 97 validation classes, and 160 testing classes, organized into 20 super-classes. The authors note that this dataset is more challenging due to its disjoint splits.

3. **CUB-200-2011**: This dataset includes 200 bird species with a total of 11,788 images. The authors mention that they follow the protocols of Hilliard et al. (2018) for splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **CIFAR-FS**: Built upon CIFAR-100, this dataset has 100 classes, each containing 600 images. The authors use the same split of 64 base, 16 validation, and 20 novel classes as in Bertinetto et al. (2018).

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **miniImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ravi, S., & Larochelle, H. (2017). Optimization as a model for few-shot learning. In ICLR.

- For **tieredImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ren, M., Triantafillou, E., Ravi, S., Snell, J., Swersky, K., Tenenbaum, J. B., & Larochelle, H. (2018). Meta-learning for semi-supervised few-shot classification. In ICLR.

- For **CUB-200-2011**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset.

- For **CIFAR-FS**, the citation is:
  > Bertinetto, L., Henriques, J. F., Torr, P. H. S., & Vedaldi, A. (2018). Meta-learning with differentiable closed-form solvers. In ICLR.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
