To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "CGoDial: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Chinese Goal-oriented Dialog Evaluation" by Yinpei Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that CGoDial consists of three datasets: a slot-based dialog dataset (SBD), a flow-based dialog dataset (FBD), and a retrieval-based dialog dataset (RBD). This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will delve into **section 3 (CGoDial Benchmark)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. Here’s what I will extract:

1. **Slot-Based Dialog Dataset (SBD)**: 
   - The SBD is constructed based on the existing RiSAWOZ dataset (Quan et al., 2020) and includes 44,800 dialogs and 473,348 turns. It incorporates features like external knowledge, out-of-scope detection, and spoken noise.
   - Citation for RiSAWOZ:
     > Quan, J., Zhang, S., Cao, Q., Li, Z., & Xiong, D. (2020). *RiSAWOZ: A large-scale multi-domain Wizard-of-Oz dataset with rich semantic annotations for task-oriented dialogue modeling*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 930–940, Online. Association for Computational Linguistics.

2. **Flow-Based Dialog Dataset (FBD)**:
   - The FBD consists of 6,786 dialogs and 26,349 turns, collected from real conversations using a tree-structured dialog flow.
   - Since this dataset is newly created and does not have a prior citation, I will note it as part of the CGoDial benchmark.

3. **Retrieval-Based Dialog Dataset (RBD)**:
   - The RBD is adapted from the E-commerce Dialogue Corpus (Zhang et al., 2018) and includes 100,000 turns of complex dialog examples.
   - Citation for E-commerce Dialogue Corpus:
     > Zhang, Y., Ou, Z., & Yu, B. (2018). *Modeling multi-turn conversation with deep utterance aggregation*. In Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 3740–3752, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After identifying and summarizing the datasets, I will compile the full citations for each dataset into a structured format. This will ensure that I have all necessary references for future use.

Finally, I will prepare to format this information according to the required output structure, ensuring clarity and completeness in the dataset descriptions and citations.
