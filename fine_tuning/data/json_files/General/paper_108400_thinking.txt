To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pruning Networks with Cross-Layer Ranking & k-Reciprocal Nearest Filters" by Mingbao Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the experiments conducted, which can lead to dataset identification.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors typically discuss the context of their research and may reference datasets used in previous works or their own experiments. I will look for any mentions of datasets or benchmarks that are relevant to their study.

Then, I will examine the **methodology** section, particularly any subsections that detail the experimental setup. This section often contains explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. I will take note of any datasets used for training or evaluation purposes.

Following that, I will review the **experiments section**. This section usually provides detailed information about the datasets used, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. If the authors mention any datasets here, I will ensure to note them down carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and credit to the original dataset creators. I will look for papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would find the citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009.

If they mention **ImageNet**, I would find the citation:
> Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document all relevant datasets from the research paper while providing proper citations for each.
