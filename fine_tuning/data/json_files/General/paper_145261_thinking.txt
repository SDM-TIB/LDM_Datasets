To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Efficient Pareto Set Approximation via Mixture of Experts Based Model Fusion" by Anke Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions conducting extensive experiments on vision and language tasks using large-scale models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they mention evaluating their method on various tasks, specifically using the **CLIP-ViT** model for image classification tasks and the **GPT-2** model for natural language tasks. 

In the experiments, they list several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition.
2. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset for fine-grained image classification of cars.
3. **RESISC45**: A dataset for remote sensing image scene classification.
4. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use and land cover classification.
5. **SVHN**: A dataset for digit recognition in natural images.
6. **GTSRB**: A dataset for traffic sign recognition.
7. **MNIST**: A dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
8. **DTD**: A dataset for texture recognition.

For the natural language tasks, the authors mention using the **GLUE benchmark**, which includes several datasets:

1. **MRPC**: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus.
2. **MNLI**: Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference.
3. **CoLA**: The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability.
4. **SST-2**: Stanford Sentiment Treebank.
5. **QNLI**: Question Natural Language Inference.
6. **QQP**: Quora Question Pairs.
7. **RTE**: Recognizing Textual Entailment.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. 

For example, the citation for the **EuroSAT dataset** is:
> Helber, P., Bischke, B., Dengel, A., & Borth, D. (2018). Introducing EuroSAT: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification. In IGARSS 2018-2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (pp. 204–207). IEEE.

The citation for the **MNIST dataset** is:
> LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278–2324.

I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I prepare the final output. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
