To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Research on Patch Attentive Neural Process" by Xiaohan Yu and Shaochen Mao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections, where datasets are more likely to be described in detail.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of Neural Processes (NP) in various fields, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will continue to the **background** and **methodology** sections, where the authors might describe the datasets used for their experiments.

Upon reviewing the **background section**, I notice that the authors mention generating a dataset based on a Gaussian process with a fixed kernel. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. This indicates that the dataset is likely synthetic and generated for the purpose of their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (if present) to see if they provide more details about the dataset used. In this case, the authors do not explicitly mention any publicly available datasets or provide citations for datasets used in their experiments.

Since the paper primarily discusses a synthetic dataset generated from a Gaussian process, I will note that down. However, I will also check the **References section** to see if any cited works provide datasets that could be relevant to their research.

After reviewing the references, I find that the authors cite several papers related to Neural Processes and attention mechanisms, but none of them provide specific datasets that are directly used in this research.

In conclusion, I will document the findings as follows:

1. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors generated a dataset based on a Gaussian process with a fixed kernel for their experiments. However, no specific name or citation is provided for this dataset.

Since there are no publicly available datasets mentioned in the paper, I will note that down as well. The lack of specific dataset citations means that I cannot provide full citations for datasets as typically required.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present them in the required format, ensuring to highlight the absence of specific dataset citations.
