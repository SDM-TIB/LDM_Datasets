To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Malaria Detection: Overview, Challenges and Future Directions" by Imen JDEY, Ghazala HCINI, and Hela LTIFI, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Malaria classification using machine learning)**, where the authors discuss various studies and their methodologies. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets used in the research. I will look for any specific dataset names, descriptions, and the number of images included.

In **subsection 2.1 (Public Datasets)**, the authors mention a public database containing **27,558 images**. They provide a link to this dataset, which is crucial for citation. I will note this dataset and its link for later citation.

Additionally, I will check **subsection 2.2 (Private Datasets)** for any other datasets mentioned. The authors describe various studies that utilize different datasets, including specific numbers of images and their sources. I will extract these details carefully.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is essential for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed by others.

For example, the public dataset mentioned is linked to:
- **Malaria Cell Images**: 27,558 images available at [NIH Malaria Dataset](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/proj/malaria/cell images.zip) and [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria).

I will also note any other datasets mentioned in the private datasets section, ensuring to capture their details and citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its citation, making it easy for others to reference and utilize the data in their own research.
