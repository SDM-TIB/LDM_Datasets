To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Chop Chop BERT: Visual Question Answering by Chopping VisualBERT’s Heads" by Chenyu Gao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset called **Task Driven Image Understanding Challenge (TDIUC)**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is being utilized in the research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1**, where the authors describe their experimental settings. Here, they explicitly mention that they conducted experiments on the **TDIUC dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset's purpose and structure, confirming its relevance to the study.

I will also check the **related work section** to see if any other datasets are referenced. However, the primary focus seems to be on the TDIUC dataset, which is designed to address the distribution bias of question types in Visual Question Answering (VQA).

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the TDIUC dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kaﬂe, K., & Kanan, C. (2017). An analysis of visual question answering algorithms. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 1965–1973.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference other models and datasets in the context of their work, but the TDIUC dataset is the primary dataset used for their experiments.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings for the dataset in a structured manner, ensuring that I include the full citation for the TDIUC dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution.

In conclusion, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **TDIUC dataset**, and its full citation is noted for reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding datasets used in the research.
