To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Parameter Selection for Distributed Optimal Power Flow" by Sihan Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or testing.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the context of the research.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MATPOWER format** for their experiments, which indicates that they are likely using datasets related to power systems. I will look for any specific references to datasets within the context of the numerical experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets from the MATPOWER library, I will find the appropriate citation for MATPOWER, which is:

> R. Zimmerman, C. Murillo-Sánchez, and R. Thomas. *MATPOWER: Steady-state operations, planning, and analysis tools for power systems research and education*. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 12–19, February 2011.

If there are any other datasets mentioned, I will follow the same process to extract their names and citations.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and presented clearly for future use or analysis.
