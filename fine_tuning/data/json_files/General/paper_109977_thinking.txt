To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-end Learnable Diversity-aware News Recommendation" by Chuhan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Experimental Settings)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they describe:

1. **MIND Dataset**: This is a large-scale English benchmark dataset for news recommendation, containing 1 million users' news click logs on Microsoft News over six weeks.

2. **PrivateNews Dataset**: This dataset is proprietary and was collected from a commercial news platform, consisting of 1 million news impression logs from a specific date range.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citation for the MIND dataset is:

- For **MIND Dataset**:
  > Fangzhao Wu, Ying Qiao, Jiun-Hung Chen, Chuhan Wu, Tao Qi, Jianxun Lian, Danyang Liu, Xing Xie, Jianfeng Gao, Winnie Wu, et al. *MIND: A Large-scale Dataset for News Recommendation*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 3597â€“3606, 2020.

The PrivateNews dataset does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it is described as a proprietary dataset collected by the authors themselves.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MIND dataset and a note regarding the PrivateNews dataset being proprietary without a formal citation.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
