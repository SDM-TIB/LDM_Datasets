To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Concurrent Training Improves the Performance of Behavioral Cloning from Observation" by Zachary W. Robertson and Matthew R. Walter, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed algorithm on various benchmark domains, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they mention using **30 demonstrations for the Mountain Car, Ant, and Half-Cheetah environments**. This indicates that these environments are likely datasets used for their experiments.

I will also check the **related work section** (Section 2) and the **theoretical analysis section** (Section 4) for any references to datasets or benchmarks that might have been used in previous studies or comparisons.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the environments used for their experiments:
1. **Mountain Car**: A classic reinforcement learning environment where the goal is to drive a car up a hill.
2. **Ant**: A more complex environment where the robot must learn to navigate and perform tasks.
3. **Half-Cheetah**: Another challenging environment that involves locomotion tasks.

Now, I will look for full citations for these environments in the **References section**. However, since these environments are standard benchmarks in the reinforcement learning community, they may not have specific citations in the paper. Instead, I will note that they are part of the OpenAI Gym and PyBullet physics simulator.

For the **Mountain Car**, the citation is:
> G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

For the **Ant** and **Half-Cheetah**, they are also part of the OpenAI Gym, so the same citation applies.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations. The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Mountain Car**: A reinforcement learning environment for training agents to navigate a car up a hill.
   - Citation: G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

2. **Ant**: A complex environment for training agents to navigate and perform tasks.
   - Citation: G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

3. **Half-Cheetah**: A locomotion task environment for training agents.
   - Citation: G. Brockman, V. Cheung, L. Pettersson, J. Schneider, J. Schulman, J. Tang, and W. Zaremba. *OpenAI Gym*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1606.01540, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
