To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Machine Learning Framework for Event Identification via Modal Analysis of PMU Data" by Nima Taghipourbazargani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used two datasets for their experiments, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **results section** where the authors describe their experiments. They mention using two datasets:

1. **Texas 2000-bus synthetic grid dataset**: This dataset is obtained from dynamic simulations of line trip and generation loss events in a synthetic power system. The authors specify that they generated a total of 800 events, including 400 generation loss and 400 line trip events.

2. **Proprietary dataset**: This dataset consists of labeled events obtained from a large utility in the USA, involving measurements from nearly 500 PMUs. The authors mention that this dataset includes 70 labeled events, with 23 being generation loss events and 47 being line trip events.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The Texas 2000-bus synthetic grid dataset is referenced in the paper as follows:

- For the Texas 2000-bus synthetic grid dataset, the citation is:
  > Birchfield, A. B., Xu, T., Gegner, K. M., Shetye, K. S., & Overbye, T. J. (2017). Grid Structural Characteristics as Validation Criteria for Synthetic Networks. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 32(4), 3258-3265.

The proprietary dataset does not have a specific citation since it is described as being collected from a utility, but it is important to note that it is a real-world dataset.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Texas 2000-bus synthetic grid dataset**: A dataset generated from dynamic simulations of line trip and generation loss events in a synthetic power system, containing 800 events.
   - Citation: Birchfield, A. B., Xu, T., Gegner, K. M., Shetye, K. S., & Overbye, T. J. (2017). Grid Structural Characteristics as Validation Criteria for Synthetic Networks. *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*, 32(4), 3258-3265.

2. **Proprietary dataset**: A dataset with labeled events obtained from a large utility in the USA, involving measurements from nearly 500 PMUs, containing 70 labeled events.
   - Citation: Not applicable (proprietary dataset).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
