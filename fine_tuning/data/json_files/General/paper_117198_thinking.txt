To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Entity Tracking via Effective Use of Multi-Task Learning Model and Mention-guided Decoding" by Janvijay Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method, MEET, achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular entity tracking datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they refer to two benchmark datasets: **ProPara** and **Recipes**. I will gather details about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics provided.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the **ProPara dataset** as containing 488 scientific process-based procedural paragraphs, while the **Recipes dataset** consists of 866 cooking recipes. They also provide average statistics for both datasets, such as the number of procedures and average steps per procedure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ProPara**, the citation is:
  > Bhavana Dalvi, Lifu Huang, Niket Tandon, Wen-tau Yih, and Peter Clark. *Tracking state changes in procedural text: a challenge dataset and models for process paragraph comprehension*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers), pages 1595â€“1604, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

- For **Recipes**, the citation is:
  > Antoine Bosselut, Omer Levy, Ari Holtzman, Corin Ennis, Dieter Fox, and Yejin Choi. *Simulating action dynamics with neural process networks*. In Proceedings of the 6th International Conference for Learning Representations (ICLR), 2018.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
