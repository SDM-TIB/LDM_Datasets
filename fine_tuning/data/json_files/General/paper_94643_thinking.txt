To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Representational aspects of depth and conditioning in normalizing flows" by Frederic Koehler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract typically provides a summary of the work and may mention key datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where authors usually detail the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that are provided.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that discuss empirical results or evaluations, as these often include datasets used for training and testing models. I will also check for any tables or figures that may summarize the datasets or their properties.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, I would look for the following citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: A benchmark in machine learning*. 2009.

If the paper discusses a dataset like **MNIST**, I would find its citation:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998.

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will review the entire process to ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper, ready for further analysis or reporting.
