To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SOTOPIA: Interactive Evaluation for Social Intelligence in Language Agents" by Xuhui Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SOTOPIA environment and hints at the use of various datasets for generating social scenarios and evaluating agent performance.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the parts that describe how the authors generated scenarios and characters. Here, they mention using data from several existing datasets to inspire the generation of social scenarios. Specifically, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the creation of the SOTOPIA environment.

In the **task space section**, the authors detail the datasets that were referenced to generate scenarios. They mention using data from the following sources:

1. **Social Chemistry**: This dataset is referenced for generating social scenarios and is cited as:
   > Maxwell Forbes, Jena D. Hwang, Vered Shwartz, Maarten Sap, and Yejin Choi. *Social Chemistry 101: Learning to Reason about Social and Moral Norms*. In Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 653–670, 2020.

2. **Social IQa**: This dataset is also mentioned for scenario generation, with the citation:
   > Maarten Sap, Hannah Rashkin, Derek Chen, Ronan Le Bras, and Yejin Choi. *Social IQa: Commonsense Reasoning about Social Interactions*. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 4463–4473, 2019.

3. **Deal-or-no-Deal**: This dataset is referenced for generating scenarios related to negotiation, and the citation is:
   > Lewis R. Goldberg, Denis Yarats, Yann Dauphin, Devi Parikh, and Dhruv Batra. *Deal or No Deal? End-to-End Learning of Negotiation Dialogues*. In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 2443–2453, 2017.

4. **NormBank**: This dataset is used for generating scenarios and is cited as:
   > Caleb Ziems, Jane Dwivedi-Yu, Yi-Chia Wang, Alon Halevy, and Diyi Yang. *NormBank: A Knowledge Bank of Situational Social Norms*. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 7756–7776, 2023.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific contributions to the SOTOPIA environment, such as how they were used to inspire the generation of social scenarios and characters.

Finally, I will compile the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective contributions to the study.
