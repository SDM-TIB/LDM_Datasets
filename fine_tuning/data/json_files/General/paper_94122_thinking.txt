To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BoostingBERT: Integrating Multi-Class Boosting into BERT for NLP Tasks" by Tongwen Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on the **GLUE dataset** and three popular **Chinese NLU benchmarks**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for understanding the experimental results.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they explicitly mention:

1. **GLUE Dataset**: A benchmark for evaluating natural language understanding tasks, which includes multiple sub-tasks.
2. **ChnSenti**: A dataset for sentiment analysis in Chinese.
3. **XNLI**: The Cross-lingual Natural Language Inference corpus, which is a collection of sentence pairs annotated for entailment.
4. **ECDT**: A dataset used for classifying user intents in human-computer dialogue technology.

In the **appendix**, the authors provide additional details about each dataset, including their purpose and structure. This is important for understanding how each dataset contributes to the experiments.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section**:

- For the **GLUE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing, pages 1631–1642.

- For **ChnSenti**, the citation is:
  > Lin, Z. et al. *Sentiment classification analysis based on extraction of sentiment key sentence*. Jisuanji Yanjiu yu Fazhan/Computer Research and Development, 49:2376–2382, 2012.

- For **XNLI**, the citation is:
  > Alexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Ruty Rinott, Adina Williams, Samuel R Bowman, Holger Schwenk, and Veselin Stoyanov. *XNLI: Evaluating cross-lingual sentence representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.05053, 2018.

- For **ECDT**, the citation is:
  > Wei-Nan Zhang, Zhigang Chen, Wanxiang Che, Guoping Hu, and Ting Liu. *The first evaluation of Chinese human-computer dialogue technology*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.10217, 2017.

After compiling this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation for future reference or processing.
