To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A relic sketch extraction framework based on detail-aware hierarchical deep network" by Jinye Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for training or evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental results section typically details the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of sketch extraction for painted cultural relics and mention the challenges faced due to limited data. This suggests that they may have used specific datasets to train their models.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used:

1. **Natural Image Dataset (BSDS500)**: This dataset is used to pre-train the detail-aware BDCN model. It contains 500 images and reference edge labels.

2. **Painted Cultural Relics Images**: The authors collected 53 relic images from Fengguo Temple, Qianling, and the Dunhuang murals. They mention that the reference sketches were delineated by experts from the Shaanxi History Museum.

3. **Hyperspectral Painted Cultural Relics Images**: The authors used hyperspectral imaging equipment to collect over 20 relic images from Fengguo Temple and Qianling, selecting specific bands for testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **BSDS500**, the citation is:
  > P. Arbelaez, M. Maire, C. Fowlkes, and J. Malik. "Contour detection and hierarchical image segmentation." IEEE Trans Pattern Anal Mach Intell, 33(5):898â€“916, 2011.

- For the **painted cultural relics images**, since they are collected by the authors, I will note that they are not from a publicly available dataset but rather a custom collection.

- For the **hyperspectral images**, the authors do not provide a specific citation for the hyperspectral imaging equipment or dataset, but they mention using hyperspectral imaging technology widely used in cultural relic research.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the datasets that have them. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper.
