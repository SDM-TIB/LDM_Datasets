To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Cross-Lingual Relation Extraction with Transformers" by Jian Ni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, which indicates that specific datasets are used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized. Here, they mention:

1. **ACE05 Dataset**: This dataset includes manually annotated relation extraction data for three languages: English, Arabic, and Chinese. It defines seven entity types and six relation types.

2. **KLUE Dataset**: This dataset contains manually annotated relation extraction data for six languages: English, German, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese. It defines 56 entity types and 53 relation types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ACE05 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Christopher Walker, Stephanie Strassel, Julie Medero, and Kazuaki Maeda. *ACE 2005 multilingual training corpus*. In Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2006.

- For the **KLUE Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ding-Jung (Benjamin) Han. *KLUE Annotation Guidelines - Version 2.0*. IBM Research Report, RC25042, 2010.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
