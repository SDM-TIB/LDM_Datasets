To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics" by Kislaya Ravi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any mention of datasets or data sources used in the research.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of surrogate modeling and the need for data. They mention using multi-fidelity methods, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly any subsections that discuss datasets or experiments. Here, the authors describe their approach to multi-fidelity modeling and may provide details about the datasets used for training and testing their models.

In **section 4 (Numerical Examples)**, the authors present various academic and real-world examples. I will carefully examine this section for any explicit mentions of datasets. For instance, they describe the terramechanical example, which includes data from two types of lower-fidelity models (TerRA and SCM) and a high-fidelity model (TROLL). I will note down the details of these datasets.

The authors also mention a plasma-physics example, where they use the Automated System for Transport Analysis (ASTRA) with two subroutines (QLK and QLKNN) for low and high-fidelity models, respectively. I will extract this information as well.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For the terramechanical example, I will cite the relevant papers that describe the TerRA and SCM models, as well as the TROLL testbed. For the plasma-physics example, I will cite the papers related to ASTRA, QLK, and QLKNN.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will ensure that I have the following datasets:

1. **TerRA Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Fabian Buse. *Development and Validation of a Deformable Soft Soil Contact Model for Dynamic Rover Simulations*. PhD thesis, Tohoku University, 2022.

2. **SCM Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Fabian Buse. *Development and Validation of a Deformable Soft Soil Contact Model for Dynamic Rover Simulations*. PhD thesis, Tohoku University, 2022.

3. **TROLL Dataset**:

4. **ASTRA Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Gregorij V Pereverzev and PN Yushmanov. *ASTRA: Automated System for Transport Analysis in a Tokamak*. 2002.

5. **QLK Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Clarisse Bourdelle. *Turbulent Transport in Tokamak Plasmas: Bridging Theory and Experiment*. PhD thesis, Aix Marseille UniversitÃ©, 2015.

6. **QLKNN Dataset**: 
   - Citation: 
     > Aaron Ho et al. *Neural Network Surrogate of QuaLiKiz Using JET Experimental Data to Populate Training Space*. Physics of Plasmas, 28(3), 2021.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets and their citations in a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets from the paper along with their full citations.
