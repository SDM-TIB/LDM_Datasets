To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parametric Scaling of Preprocessing assisted U-net Architecture for Improvised Retinal Vessel Segmentation" by Kundan Kumar and Sumanshu Agarwal, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and materials and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validated their method on the **DRIVE database**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Method)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset used for their experiments. They mention that the **DRIVE (Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction)** dataset contains 40 color images, with 20 for training and 20 for testing. This section provides specific details about the dataset, including its resolution and the availability of ground truth images.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DRIVE dataset. The authors reference the original paper that describes the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation.

The citation for the DRIVE dataset is:
> Staal, J., Abramoﬀ, M.D., Niemeijer, M., Viergever, M.A., Van Ginneken, B. "Ridge-based vessel segmentation in color images of the retina." *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, 23(4), 501–509, 2004.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Focus on the materials and methods section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the DRIVE dataset, ensuring that it is complete and accurately cited.
