To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Visual Transformer by Learnable Token Merging" by Yancheng Wang and Yingzhen Yang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation. 

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors usually describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will pay attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as well as any textual descriptions that provide details about the datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for mentions of datasets like ImageNet, COCO, or any other specific datasets that the authors might have used for training or evaluation. For instance, if the authors mention using the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks, I will note that down.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention using the ImageNet dataset, I will look for the citation that corresponds to it, which might look something like this:
> O. Russakovsky et al., "ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge," International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 115, no. 3, pp. 211-252, 2015.

Similarly, if they mention the COCO dataset, I will find its citation:
> T.-Y. Lin et al., "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context," in European Conference on Computer Vision, 2014.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments section for detailed descriptions of datasets used.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset mentioned.
4. Compile the dataset information, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper.
