To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multitask Adaptation by Retrospective Exploration with Learned World Models" by Artem Zholus and Aleksandr I. Panov, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may mention specific benchmarks or datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (section 5) where the authors describe the environments and tasks used for their experiments. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets or environments utilized in their research.

In section 5, the authors mention testing their model on several domains, specifically:
1. **DeepMind Control Suite**: This suite includes various tasks that are commonly used in reinforcement learning research. I will look for specific tasks mentioned within this suite.
2. **Meta-World**: This is a benchmark for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning, which may include multiple datasets or tasks.
3. **NVIDIA Isaac Environment**: This is a custom environment created for their experiments, which may also be considered a dataset in the context of reinforcement learning.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets or environments mentioned. The references may include foundational papers or documentation for the datasets used in the experiments.

For the **DeepMind Control Suite**, the citation is:
> Tassa, Y., Tunyasuvunakool, S., Muldal, A., Doron, Y., Liu, S., Bohez, S., Merel, J., Erez, T., Lillicrap, T., & Heess, N. (2020). *dm_control: Software and tasks for continuous control*. 

For the **Meta-World**, the citation is:
> Yu, T., Quillen, D., He, Z., Julian, R., Hausman, K., Finn, C., & Levine, S. (2019). *Meta-world: A benchmark and evaluation for multi-task and meta reinforcement learning*. In Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL).

For the **NVIDIA Isaac Environment**, since it is a custom environment created by the authors, I will note that it is based on the NVIDIA Isaac SDK, which can be referenced as:
> NVIDIA. (n.d.). *NVIDIA Isaac SDK*. Retrieved from https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sdk.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset or environment as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
