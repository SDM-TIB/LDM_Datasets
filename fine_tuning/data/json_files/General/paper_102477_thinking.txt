To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking and Improving Relative Position Encoding for Vision Transformer" by Kan Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions improvements in performance on datasets like **ImageNet** and **COCO**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.3, the authors compare their methods on **ImageNet** and **COCO** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for evaluation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In CVPR, 2009.

2. **COCO**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Doll√°r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In ECCV, 2014.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification tasks.
- **COCO**: A dataset used for object detection and segmentation tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately captured for future reference or processing.
