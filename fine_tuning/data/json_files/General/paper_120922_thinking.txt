To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data Augmentation and Classification of Sea-Land Clutter for Over-the-Horizon Radar Using AC-VAEGAN" by Xiaoxuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a dataset of OTHR sea-land clutter, which suggests that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **Section IV (Experiment and Evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention preparing three kinds of sea-land clutter datasets: **original dataset, imbalanced dataset, and scarce dataset**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets.

In **Section IV.A (Dataset)**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **Sea-Land Clutter Dataset**. They specify the classes, attributes, labels, and quantities for each class, which are crucial for understanding the dataset's structure. The dataset consists of three classes: sea, land, and sea-land, with a total of 3000 samples (1000 for each class). The training and testing splits are also provided.

Additionally, the authors mention the **MSTAR dataset** in the same section, which is used to validate the AC-VAEGAN method. They provide a detailed description of the classes and quantities for this dataset as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Sea-Land Clutter Dataset**, the paper does not provide a specific citation, as it appears to be a dataset collected by the authors themselves. Therefore, I will note it as an original dataset created for this study.

2. For the **MSTAR Dataset**, the citation is:
   > E. R. Keydel, S. W. Lee, and J. T. Moore. *MSTAR Extended Operating Conditions: A Tutorial*. Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery III, vol. 2757, pp. 228â€“242, 1996.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations where applicable. The Sea-Land Clutter Dataset will be noted as an original dataset, while the MSTAR dataset will have its citation included.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for each dataset extracted from the paper.
