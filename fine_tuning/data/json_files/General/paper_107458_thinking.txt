To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual attention prediction improves performance of autonomous drone racing agents" by Christian Pfeiffer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses eye gaze and flight trajectory data from human drone pilots, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods section**, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention the "Eye Gaze Drone Racing Dataset," which is publicly available and consists of eye gaze data, control commands, drone state ground-truth, and FPV video recordings from experienced drone pilots. This is a key dataset for the research.

The paper provides a link to the dataset on the Open Science Framework, which is crucial for citation purposes. The authors also mention that the dataset includes 675,251 valid frames from 18 subjects, split into training and test sets. This detailed description will help in documenting the dataset accurately.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The dataset is originally released by the authors of the paper, so I will cite it as follows:

- **Eye Gaze Drone Racing Dataset**:
  > Pfeiffer, C., Wengeler, S., Loquercio, A., & Scaramuzza, D. (2022). *Eye Gaze Drone Racing Dataset*. Open Science Framework. https://osf.io/gvdse/

Additionally, I will note that the dataset is available in another Open Science Framework repository with a DOI for further reference:

- DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/UABX4

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
