To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DEFT-FUNNEL: An Open-Source Global Optimization Solver for Constrained Grey-Box and Black-Box Problems" by Phillipe R. Sampaio, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are referenced. The abstract mentions that the code and test sets used for experiments are available on a GitHub repository, which suggests that datasets may be included there.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. In this case, I will focus on the **numerical experiments** section, as it typically contains information about the datasets used for testing the proposed methods.

In the **numerical experiments** section, the author discusses two types of experiments: one focused on black-box optimization problems and the other on grey-box optimization problems. The author lists several benchmark problems used in these experiments, which are likely datasets.

I will compile the datasets mentioned in the experiments:

1. **Benchmark Problems for Black-Box Optimization**:
   - **Harley Pooling Problem**: A well-known optimization problem with a specific objective function value.
   - **Welded Beam Design (WB4)**: Another benchmark problem with defined constraints and objective values.
   - **Gas Transmission Compressor Design (GTCD4)**: This problem is also included in the experiments.
   - **Pressure Vessel Design (PVD4)**: Another benchmark problem referenced.
   - **Speed Reducer Design (SR7)**: Included in the set of benchmark problems.
   - **Hesse Problem**: A complex problem with multiple local minima.
   - **GÃ³mez #3 Problem**: Another benchmark problem with disconnected feasible regions.
   - **G3, G4, G6, G7, G8, G9, G11**: Additional benchmark problems referenced in the experiments.

2. **Grey-Box Optimization Problems**:
   - **GTCD4**: Reused from the black-box experiments.
   - **SR7**: Also reused from the black-box experiments.
   - **Hesse**: Reused from the black-box experiments.
   - **HS21**: A problem from the Hock-Schittkowski collection with specific characteristics.
   - **HS23**: Another problem from the same collection.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for benchmark problems are often included in the references, which will provide authoritative sources for each dataset.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- For the **Harley Pooling Problem**, I will find the original source or paper that introduced it.
- For **Welded Beam Design**, I will locate the reference that describes this problem in detail.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its full citation, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or sharing with others interested in the datasets used in this research.
