To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-objective Asynchronous Successive Halving" by Robin Schmucker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their empirical analysis. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on three real-world tasks: Neural Architecture Search, Algorithmic Fairness, and Language Model Optimization. I will look for specific datasets associated with each of these tasks.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **NAS-201 Benchmark Dataset**: This dataset is used for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and contains evaluations of 15,625 different neural network architectures across three datasets. The specific datasets used for evaluation in NAS-201 are not detailed in the text, but it is a well-known benchmark in the field.

2. **Adult Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating algorithmic fairness techniques. It contains census data and is used to predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ron Kohavi. *Scaling up the accuracy of naive-bayes classifiers: A decision-tree hybrid*. In KDD, volume 96, pages 202â€“207, 1996.

3. **Wikitext2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for training language models and is known for its application in evaluating perplexity and word error rate. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, James Bradbury, and Richard Socher. *Pointer sentinel mixture models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.07843, 2016.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper, as this is crucial for proper documentation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
