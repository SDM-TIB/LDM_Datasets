To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PESTS: Persian_English Cross Lingual Corpus for Semantic Textual Similarity" by Mohammad Abdous et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract introduces the PESTS dataset, which is a corpus of semantic textual similarity between Persian and English sentences. It mentions that this dataset contains 5,375 sentence pairs, which is a clear indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the PESTS dataset in detail, including its purpose, the number of sentence pairs, and the methodology used to create it. 

In the **corpus production process** section, the authors explain how they constructed the dataset, starting with a Persian-Persian semantic similarity corpus and then translating it into English. They also provide statistics about the dataset, confirming its size and structure.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PESTS dataset. The paper provides a link to the dataset's GitHub repository, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- For the PESTS dataset, the citation is:
  > Abdous, M., Piroozfar, P., & Minaei Bidgoli, B. (2023). PESTS: Persian_English Cross Lingual Corpus for Semantic Textual Similarity. Available at: https://github.com/mohammadabdous/PESTS

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **PESTS Dataset**: A corpus containing 5,375 sentence pairs for measuring semantic textual similarity between Persian and English.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review. This structured entry will include the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured.
