To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Simple Adaptive Unfolding Network for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction" by Junyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors set new records on **CAVE** and **KAIST** HSI reconstruction benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will proceed to the **introduction** section. Here, the authors discuss the applications of hyperspectral images and mention the CASSI systems, but they do not provide additional dataset details. However, the mention of CAVE and KAIST in the abstract is sufficient to confirm their relevance.

In the **experiments section (Section 4)**, I will look for a subsection specifically dedicated to datasets. In **Section 4.1**, the authors explicitly state that they conducted simulations on two public datasets: **CAVE** and **KAIST**. They describe the CAVE dataset as being developed by Yasuma et al. in 2010 and the KAIST dataset as developed by Choi et al. in 2017. This provides the necessary details for both datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section**:

1. **CAVE Dataset**:
   > Yasuma, F., Mitsunaga, T., Iso, D., & Nayar, S. K. (2010). Generalized assorted pixel camera: postcapture control of resolution, dynamic range, and spectrum. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 19(9), 2240-2250.

2. **KAIST Dataset**:
   > Choi, I., Jeon, D. S., Nam, G., Gutierrez, D., & Kim, M. H. (2017). High-quality hyperspectral reconstruction using a spectral prior. In *Proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2017 Conference* (pp. 1-12).

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

- The paper utilizes the **CAVE** dataset for simulation experiments.
- The **KAIST** dataset is also used for testing, with specific details about the scenes selected for training and testing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation, ready for further processing or review.
