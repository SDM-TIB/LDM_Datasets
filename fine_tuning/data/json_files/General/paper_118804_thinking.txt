To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auto Lead Extraction and Digitization of ECG Paper Records Using CGAN" by Rupali Patil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the digitization of ECG signals and mentions the use of images captured from paper records, which suggests that there may be a dataset related to ECG images.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section**, particularly the **Image Acquisition** subsection, where the authors describe the sources of their ECG images. They mention that the ECG records were provided by **Saidhan Hospital** and **STEMI Global**, indicating that these institutions are sources of the dataset used in their research.

In the **Methodology** section, I will also look for any specific details about the dataset, such as the number of images used, their resolution, and how they were processed. The authors state that they created a database of ECG images acquired by a camera (Samsung Galaxy S21+) and also mention the use of 12 lead ECG data records in PDF format (Model: ECG600G). This information is crucial for describing the dataset.

I will then check the **Results** section to see if the authors provide any additional insights or statistics about the dataset, such as the number of images used for training and testing. They mention using **53 images** in total, with **48 images for training** and **5 images for testing**. This detail is important for understanding the dataset's composition.

Finally, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference their own work regarding the digitization of ECG signals, which may not have a separate citation but is essential for understanding the context of their dataset.

Based on this analysis, I will compile the following dataset entries:

1. **ECG Images Dataset**: This dataset consists of ECG images captured from paper records provided by Saidhan Hospital and STEMI Global. It includes a total of 53 images, with 48 used for training and 5 for testing. The images were captured using a Samsung Galaxy S21+ camera and processed for digitization.

2. **12 Lead ECG Data Records**: This dataset includes ECG data records in PDF format (Model: ECG600G), which were used in conjunction with the captured images for the digitization process.

Now, I will write the full citations for these datasets, ensuring that I accurately represent the sources:

- For the ECG images dataset, since it is derived from the authors' own work and the institutions involved, I will note it as:
  > Rupali Patil, Bhairav Narkhede, Shubham Varma, Shreyans Suraliya, and Ninad Mehendale. *Auto Lead Extraction and Digitization of ECG Paper Records Using CGAN*. [Journal Name], [Volume], [Pages], [Year].

- For the 12 lead ECG data records, I will reference the model used:
  > ECG600G. *Model Information*. [Manufacturer/Source], [Year].

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
