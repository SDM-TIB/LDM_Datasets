To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Equalized Focal Loss for Dense Long-Tailed Object Detection" by Bo Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on the **LVIS v1 benchmark**, which suggests that this is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on the **LVIS v1 dataset** and also mention the **OpenImages dataset**. I will take note of these datasets and their descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the **LVIS v1 dataset**, describing it as a large vocabulary benchmark for long-tailed object recognition, containing 1203 categories and about 1.3 million instances in the training split. They also mention that the **OpenImages dataset** is used for additional experiments, which contains 500 categories and 1.7 million images in the training split.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **LVIS v1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Agrim Gupta, Piotr Dollar, and Ross Girshick. *LVIS: A Dataset for Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5356–5364, 2019.

2. For the **OpenImages dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alina Kuznetsova, Hassan Rom, Neil Alldrin, Jasper Uijlings, Ivan Krasin, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Shahab Kamali, Stefan Popov, Matteo Malloci, Alexander Kolesnikov, et al. *The Open Images Dataset V4*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 128(7):1956–1981, 2020.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **LVIS v1 Dataset**: A large vocabulary benchmark for long-tailed object recognition, containing 1203 categories and approximately 1.3 million instances in the training split.
- **OpenImages Dataset**: A dataset containing 500 categories and 1.7 million images, used for additional experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
