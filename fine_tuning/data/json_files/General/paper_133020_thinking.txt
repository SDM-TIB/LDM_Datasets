To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TransCC: Transformer Network for Coronary Artery CCTA Segmentation" by Chenchu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the importance of CCTA images for coronary artery segmentation, which suggests that datasets related to CCTA images will be discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental setup)**, where the authors typically provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they utilized a comprehensive set of CCTA datasets, specifically stating that they selected a total of **848 CCTA images** from six patients, with each image measuring **600 × 600 pixels**. This indicates that the dataset is specifically curated for their study.

I will also look for any additional details about the datasets, such as their source or any specific characteristics that might be relevant. The authors mention that the dataset consists of images that include coronary arteries, which is crucial for understanding the context of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, in this case, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it appears to be a custom dataset created from patient images. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is derived from clinical data without a formal citation.

To summarize, the dataset extracted from the paper is as follows:

1. **CCTA Dataset**: A custom dataset consisting of 848 CCTA images selected from six patients, each measuring 600 × 600 pixels. The dataset focuses on images that include coronary arteries.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
