To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancement of Pitch Controllability using Timbre-Preserving Pitch Augmentation in FastPitch" by Hanbin Bae and Young-Sun Joo, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a training algorithm that utilizes pitch-augmented speech datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will look for explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for a diverse range of pitch samples for training, hinting at the existence of a dataset that includes various pitch ranges. However, I need to find the exact names and details of these datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention using "14,000 speech samples of a single Korean female speaker," which indicates that this is a dataset they created or utilized for their experiments. They also specify how this dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, which is crucial information.

I will also check the **data preparation section** for any additional details about the dataset, such as how the samples were collected or processed. The authors mention that the dataset was sampled at 22.05 kHz and consists of approximately 20 hours of speech, which provides context about the dataset's characteristics.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not seem to reference any external datasets explicitly, as it primarily discusses the authors' own dataset.

Since the authors created their dataset, I will note that the citation for this dataset would be:
> Hanbin Bae and Young-Sun Joo. *Enhancement of Pitch Controllability using Timbre-Preserving Pitch Augmentation in FastPitch*. Speech AI Lab, NCSOFT Corp., Republic of Korea, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for proper attribution and reference in future work.
