To extract datasets from the research paper titled "General multi-fidelity surrogate models: Framework and active learning strategies for efficient rare event simulation" by Promit Chakroborty et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or case studies.

Next, I will focus on the **case studies and experiments sections** of the paper. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for validation or testing. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant metrics or parameters associated with them.

In the **case studies section**, the authors describe two analytical and two numerical case studies. I will pay close attention to any datasets mentioned in these contexts. For example, if they refer to specific models or simulations, I will check if they provide any dataset names or references.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced correctly in future work.

For instance, if the paper mentions a dataset like "TRISO particle fuel performance data," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail. The citation should include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring that they are clear and well-documented for future reference.
