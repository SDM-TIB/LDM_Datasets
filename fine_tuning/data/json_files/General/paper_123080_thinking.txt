To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient and Explicit Modelling of Image Hierarchies for Image Restoration" by Yawei Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets along with their full citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is applied to **seven image restoration types**, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any tables or figures that list datasets, as well as any accompanying text that describes them.

In the experiments section, I notice that the authors mention using various datasets for different image restoration tasks. Specifically, they refer to datasets for tasks like **image super-resolution**, **image denoising**, **JPEG compression artifacts removal**, **demosaicking**, **single image motion deblurring**, and **defocus deblurring**. I will take note of any datasets explicitly named in this context.

Upon reviewing the tables, I find references to specific datasets:

1. **GoPro Dataset**: Used for training in single-image motion deblurring. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Seungjun Nah, Tae Hyun Kim, and Kyoung Mu Lee. *Deep multi-scale convolutional neural network for dynamic scene deblurring*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3883–3891, 2017.

2. **RealBlur Dataset**: Used for testing in single-image motion deblurring. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jaesung Rim, Haeyun Lee, Jucheol Won, and Sunghyun Cho. *Real-world blur dataset for learning and benchmarking deblurring algorithms*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 184–201, Springer, 2020.

3. **Urban100 Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of image super-resolution. The citation for this dataset is:
   > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, volume 2, pages 416–423. IEEE, 2001.

4. **BSD68 Dataset**: Used for image denoising tasks. The citation for this dataset is:
   > David Martin, Charless Fowlkes, Doron Tal, and Jitendra Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, volume 2, pages 416–423. IEEE, 2001.

5. **Kodak Dataset**: Also mentioned for image denoising. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rich Franzen. *Kodak lossless true color image suite*. source: http://r0k.us/graphics/kodak, 4(2), 1999.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, including the specific tasks they were used for and any unique characteristics mentioned in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for future reference or processing.
