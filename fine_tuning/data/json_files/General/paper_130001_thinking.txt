To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Sparse then Prune: Toward Efficient Vision Transformers" by Yogi Prasetyo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and method sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to using **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 datasets** for their experiments, which indicates that these datasets are crucial to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 RGB images categorized into ten classes, with each class containing 6,000 images. The images are standardized to a resolution of 32x32 pixels.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 60,000 images of the same resolution but is divided into 100 classes, providing a broader range of categories for classification tasks.

3. **ImageNet-100**: This is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, specifically containing 100 classes sampled from ImageNet1k. The authors mention that this dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their model after applying sparse regularization and pruning techniques.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets to ensure proper attribution:

- For **CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009. 

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng Su, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015. doi:10.1007/s11263-015-0816-y.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
