To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fake News Detection Using Majority Voting Technique" by Dharmaraj R. Patil, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors used a "publicly available fake news dataset, comprising of 20,800 news articles among which 10,387 are real and 10,413 are fake news labeled as binary 0 and 1." This indicates that there is a specific dataset being utilized.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **methodology** and **experimental setup** sections. In section 4.1, the author explicitly mentions the "Fake News Kaggle dataset," confirming that this is the dataset used for their experiments. The dataset is described as containing 20,800 news articles, with a breakdown of real and fake articles.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the dataset is available on Kaggle, so I will note that down as the source.

The citation for the dataset is:
> Fake News Dataset. Available online: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data

Since this is a publicly available dataset, I will ensure to include the URL in the citation.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation accurately.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper is:
- **Dataset Name**: Fake News Kaggle Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset comprising 20,800 news articles, with 10,387 labeled as real and 10,413 labeled as fake news (binary 0 and 1).
- **Citation**: Fake News Dataset. Available online: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data

With this information, I will be ready to format it according to the required structure for further processing or review.
