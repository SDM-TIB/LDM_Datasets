To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brainformer: Modeling MRI Brain Functions to Machine Vision" by Xuan-Bac Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may include references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this section, the authors mention leveraging the **Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD)** for pretraining their model. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In the **4.1 Datasets subsection**, the authors provide specific information about the NSD, stating that it is a comprehensive compilation of responses from eight subjects obtained through high-quality 7T fMRI scans. They mention that each subject was exposed to approximately 73,000 natural scenes, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NSD. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Emily J Allen, Ghislain St-Yves, Yihan Wu, Jesse L Breedlove, Jacob S Prince, Logan T Dowdle, Matthias Nau, Brad Caron, Franco Pestilli, Ian Charest, et al. *A massive 7t fmri dataset to bridge cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence*. Nature neuroscience, 25(1):116â€“126, 2022.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the experimental results, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NSD, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
