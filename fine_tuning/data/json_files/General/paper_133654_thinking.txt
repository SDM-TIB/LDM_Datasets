To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring In-Context Learning of Textless Speech Language Model for Speech Classification Tasks" by Ming-Hao Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the context of the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing speech language models and the need for in-context learning (ICL). However, they do not mention specific datasets here.

Next, I will focus on the **method section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.1. Tasks and Datasets**. Here, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they evaluate the speech LM's ICL ability on a diverse set of speech classification tasks with **seven datasets**. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Arabic SC**: A dataset for Arabic speech command recognition.
2. **IEMOCAP**: An interactive emotional dyadic motion capture database.
3. **Google SC v2**: A dataset for limited-vocabulary speech recognition.
4. **Lithuanian SC**: A dataset for speech command recognition in Lithuanian.
5. **Dysarthric Mandarin SC**: A dataset for speech command recognition for dysarthric patients.
6. **Voxforge**: A dataset for open-source speech recognition.
7. **MUStARD**: A dataset for multimodal sarcasm detection.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I found:

- **Arabic SC**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
