To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-learning sparse PCA for multimode process monitoring" by Jingxin Zhang, Donghua Zhou, and Maoyin Chen, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and case study sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a "numerical case" and a "practical pulverizing system," which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these examples.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **case study section**. The authors describe two case studies: one involving a numerical case and another involving a coal pulverizing system. I will pay close attention to any data descriptions, including the number of samples, variables, and any specific characteristics of the datasets.

In the **numerical case**, the authors mention generating 1000 normal samples and 1000 samples for fault detection, which includes specific distributions for different modes. I will note the details provided about the data generation process, including the distributions used (uniform and Gaussian) and the parameters for each mode.

In the **pulverizing system case**, the authors provide information about the number of training and testing samples for different modes, as well as the types of faults being monitored. I will extract this information to document the datasets used in this practical application.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. If the datasets are original to the authors' work, I will note that as well.

For the **numerical case**, I will document the following dataset:
- **Numerical Dataset**: Generated from two modes with specific distributions (Mode 1 and Mode 2). The dataset consists of 2000 samples in total, with details on the distributions used for each variable.

For the **pulverizing system case**, I will document:
- **Pulverizing System Dataset**: Contains data from a coal pulverizing system with specific training and testing sample sizes for different modes and faults.

Finally, I will compile the full citations for any referenced datasets or methodologies, ensuring that I provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset identified.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entries for documentation, ensuring that I include all necessary details and citations for future reference.
