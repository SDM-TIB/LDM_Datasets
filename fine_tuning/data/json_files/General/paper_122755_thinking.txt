To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of a Batter in ODI Cricket Implementing Regression Models from Match Commentary" by Ahmad Al Asad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the authors gathered fundamental cricket data from open-source datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, in the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of various factors like pitch and weather conditions, hinting that they may have used specific datasets to analyze these variables. I will look for any references to datasets in this section.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, the authors describe their data collection process. They mention collecting data from **ESPNcricinfo** and **Cricmetric**. This is a crucial point as it indicates the sources of their datasets.

In **section III (Methodology)**, the authors detail the primary dataset they used, which includes batting records for three players: Rohit Sharma, David Warner, and Kane Williamson. They specifically mention that they collected data from **ESPNcricinfo's Statsguru** and **Cricmetric**. I will note these datasets and their descriptions:

1. **ESPNcricinfo Statsguru Dataset**: This dataset includes batting records for over 500 matches, containing variables such as "Bat1," "Runs," "BF," "SR," "4s," "6s," "Opposition," "Ground," and "Start Date."

2. **Cricmetric Dataset**: This dataset provides additional statistics, specifically the "Dot Ball %" for all matches.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors mention that they created a new dataset that includes additional features derived from their analysis, such as "Opposition Rank," "Opposition Index," "Middled," "Left Alone," "Control," "Actual Control," "Pitch," "Pitch Index," "Weather," and "Impact." However, this dataset is a result of their processing and not a separate dataset from an external source.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for the datasets mentioned:

- For the **ESPNcricinfo Statsguru**, the citation is:
  > ESPNcricinfo. "ESPNcricinfo - Cricket Teams, Scores, Stats, News, Fixtures, Results, Tables." [Online]. Available: http://www.espncricinfo.com/. [Accessed: 28-May-2022].

- For the **Cricmetric Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Cricmetric. "Cricmetric Cricket statistics, analytics, live match score." [Online]. Available: http://www.cricmetric.com/. [Accessed: 28-May-2022].

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all relevant details are captured for further processing or review.
