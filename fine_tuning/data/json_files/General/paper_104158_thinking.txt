To extract datasets from the research paper titled "NudgeSeg: Zero-Shot Object Segmentation by Repeated Physical Interaction" by Chahat Deep Singh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or comparison. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In the **results section**, I will check for any additional context or insights regarding the datasets, such as performance metrics or comparisons with other methods. This may help confirm the datasets' relevance and importance in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets themselves.

For this paper, I will specifically look for datasets mentioned in the context of the experiments. If the authors refer to any established datasets, such as "ChairThingsMix" or "YCB object set," I will ensure to extract their full citations as follows:

1. **ChairThingsMix**: I will look for the original paper or source that introduced this dataset and extract the citation.
2. **YCB Object Set**: Similarly, I will find the citation for the YCB object set, which is commonly used in robotics and manipulation research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and accuracy in the dataset extraction process, ensuring that all relevant information is captured effectively.
