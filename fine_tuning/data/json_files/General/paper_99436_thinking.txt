To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EXPLAINABOARD: An Explainable Leaderboard for NLP" by Pengfei Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss tasks and datasets**. The abstract mentions that EXPLAINABOARD covers **50 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed in detail throughout the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Tasks, Datasets, and Systems)**, where the authors provide a brief description of the datasets included in EXPLAINABOARD. This section is crucial as it outlines the specific datasets used for various NLP tasks.

In this section, the authors mention several tasks and the corresponding datasets. For example:

1. **Sentiment Classification**: The authors reference the dataset used for sentiment classification, which is the **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: They mention the **CoNLL-2003 dataset**, which is widely used for NER tasks.
3. **Machine Translation**: The paper refers to datasets from the **WMT shared tasks**, specifically the WMT20 dataset.

I will also look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as these often provide concise information about the datasets, including their characteristics and the tasks they are associated with.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to allow readers to locate the datasets easily.

For example, I will find the following citations:

- **Stanford Sentiment Treebank**:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642.

- **CoNLL-2003 Dataset**:
  > Tjong Kim Sang, E. F., & De Meulder, F. (2003). *Introduction to the CoNLL-2003 Shared Task: Language-Independent Named Entity Recognition*. In Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Natural Language Learning at HLT-NAACL 2003, pages 142–147.

- **WMT20 Dataset**:
  > Barrault, L., Biesialska, M., Bojar, O., Costa-jussà, M. R., Federmann, C., Graham, Y., Grundkiewicz, R., Haddow, B., Huck, M., Joanis, E., Kocmi, T., Koehn, P., Lo, C., Ljubešić, N., Monz, C., Morishita, M., Nagata, M., Nakazawa, T., Pal, S., Post, M., & Zampieri, M. (2020). *Findings of the 2020 Conference on Machine Translation (WMT20)*. In Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–55.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
