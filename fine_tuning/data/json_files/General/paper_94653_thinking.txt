To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Flow in Sparse Neural Networks and How Lottery Tickets Win" by Utku Evci et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the experiments. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in previous works, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any mentions of specific datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors conducted experiments using two models: **LeNet5 on MNIST** and **ResNet-50 on ImageNet-2012**. Both of these datasets are well-known in the machine learning community, and their details are crucial for my extraction.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset consists of handwritten digits and is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The authors mention using LeNet5 architecture on this dataset, which is a classic convolutional neural network model.

2. **ImageNet-2012 Dataset**: This dataset is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. The authors used the ResNet-50 architecture on this dataset, which is another well-established model in deep learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Boser, B., Denker, J. S., Henderson, D., Howard, R. E., Hubbard, W., & Jackel, L. D. (1989). Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition. *Neural Computation*, 1(4), 541-551.

- For the **ImageNet-2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., ... & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. *International Journal of Computer Vision*, 115(3), 211-252.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured effectively.
