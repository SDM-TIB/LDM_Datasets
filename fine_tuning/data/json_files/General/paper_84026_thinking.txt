To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FAST UNSUPERVISED AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF SEM IMAGES OF CD4+ CELLS WITH VARYING EXTENT OF HIV VIRION INFECTION" by John M. Wandeto and Birgitta Dresp-Langley, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied a classification procedure to sets of SEM images of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which suggests that there are specific datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for automatic classification of medical images, specifically mentioning the use of SEM images of CD4+ cells with varying HIV infection levels. This reinforces the idea that there are datasets related to these images.

Next, I will focus on the **materials and methods section** where the authors describe the datasets in detail. They mention that a total of **34 images** were used, divided into two series:

1. **Achromatic SEM Images**: This series consists of **17 grayscale images** of CD4+ T-lymphocytes with varying extents of HIV virion infection. The images are described as having higher relative luminance contrast in infected areas compared to healthy tissue.

2. **Color-Enhanced SEM Images**: This series also consists of **17 images**, which are color-processed versions of the grayscale images. In these images, healthy tissue is coded in blue, and HIV virions are coded in yellow.

In the **results section**, the authors present the classification results based on the quantization error (QE) from the SOM output for both series of images, confirming that these datasets were used for their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific dataset citations for the SEM images used, as they appear to be original data collected by the authors.

Since the datasets are original and not publicly cited in other works, I will note that the datasets are:

- **Achromatic SEM Images of CD4+ T-lymphocytes**: 17 grayscale images with varying HIV infection levels.
- **Color-Enhanced SEM Images of CD4+ T-lymphocytes**: 17 color-processed images corresponding to the grayscale images.

I will summarize the datasets with the following details:

1. **Achromatic SEM Images**: Original dataset of grayscale images used for classification.
2. **Color-Enhanced SEM Images**: Original dataset of color-processed images used for classification.

Since there are no external citations for these datasets, I will indicate that they are original datasets created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I clearly indicate the nature of the datasets and their original source.
