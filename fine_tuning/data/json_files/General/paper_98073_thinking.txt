To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DO-GAN: A Double Oracle Framework for Generative Adversarial Networks" by Aye Phyu Phyu Aung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA datasets**, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the paper's findings.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 6) to gather more details about these datasets. The authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: This dataset contains 60,000 samples of handwritten digits with images of size 28 × 28 pixels. It is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images of size 32 × 32 pixels across 10 different classes. It is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms.

3. **CelebA Dataset**: This is a large-scale face dataset containing more than 200,000 images of size 128 × 128 pixels. It is widely used for tasks related to facial recognition and attribute prediction.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun and Corinna Cortes. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 2010.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research)*. https://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html, 2009.

- For the **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
