To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Privacy-preserving Stacking with Application to Cross-organizational Diabetes Prediction" by Quanming Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on two benchmark datasets, **MNIST** and **NEWS20**, and also apply it to a real application using the **RUIJIN dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors provide details about the MNIST and NEWS20 datasets, including their characteristics and how they were used. They also mention the RUIJIN dataset in the context of a real-world application for diabetes prediction.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The paper describes the MNIST dataset as containing images of handwritten digits, specifically using the digits 0 and 8. The authors mention that they randomly selected 5000 samples, with 60% for training and the remaining for testing.

2. **NEWS20 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a collection of newsgroup documents, where documents from the "sci" topic are treated as positive samples and those from the "talk" topic as negative samples. The authors also mention using PCA to reduce the feature dimensionality.

3. **RUIJIN Dataset**: This dataset is used for cross-organizational diabetes prediction and contains over 105,763 records collected from various branches of the Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The authors highlight the importance of privacy in handling this dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

- For **NEWS20**, the citation is:
  > Ken Lang. *Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews*. In ICML. Citeseer, 1995.

- For the **RUIJIN dataset**, since it is a specific dataset collected by the authors, I will note that it is referenced in the context of their own research and does not have a separate citation in the references.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for clarity and completeness. This will ensure that all relevant information is documented properly for future reference or analysis.
