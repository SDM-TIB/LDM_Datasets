To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Audio-Infused Automatic Image Colorization by Exploiting Audio Scene Semantics" by Pengcheng Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that an **audiovisual colorization dataset** has been established for training and testing, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection labeled **IV. A. Dataset**. Here, the authors describe the **AVColor dataset**, which is crucial for their research. They mention that this dataset is collected from **VGGSound** and consists of audiovisual pairs, specifically designed for the audio-guided image colorization task.

The authors provide details about the dataset, including:
- The dataset consists of **13 categories** such as underwater bubbling, rooster crowing, and skiing.
- The training set contains **5,383 pairs**, while the test set (AVColor Test1) has **130 pairs**.
- An additional test set (AVColor Test2) is constructed from other audiovisual datasets, containing **50 pairs**.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **AVColor dataset**, the citation is:
   > Zhao, P., Chen, Y., Zhao, Y., Jia, W., Zhang, Z., Wang, R., & Hong, R. (2021). Audio-Infused Automatic Image Colorization by Exploiting Audio Scene Semantics. *Journal of LaTeX Class Files*, 14(8), 1-10.

2. For the **VGGSound dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
