To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EigenGAN: Layer-Wise Eigen-Learning for GANs" by Zhenliang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors discuss their method's application to various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **CelebA**: This dataset contains 202,599 celebrity face images with annotations of 40 binary attributes. This is a well-known dataset in the field of facial attribute recognition.

2. **FFHQ**: The authors mention that this dataset contains 70,000 high-quality face images. FFHQ is recognized for its diversity and high resolution, making it a popular choice for generative models.

3. **Danbooru2019 Portraits**: This dataset consists of 302,652 anime face images. It is a large-scale dataset specifically designed for anime-style illustrations.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **FFHQ**, the citation is:
  > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2019.

- For **Danbooru2019 Portraits**, the citation is:
  > Gwern Branwen, Anonymous, and Danbooru Community. *Danbooru2019 Portraits: A Large-Scale Anime Head Illustration Dataset*, 2019.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or processing.
