To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generating Quizzes to Support Training on Quality Management and Assurance in Space Science and Engineering" by Andres Garcia-Silva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses a system for generating quizzes from documents about quality assurance procedures, but it does not mention specific datasets. 

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction focuses on the importance of quality management in space missions and mentions the SpaceQQuiz system but does not provide any dataset names.

Moving on to the **methodology section**, I will look for any specific datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. The paper mentions the use of models like T5, BART, and RoBERTa, and references SQuAD1.1 and SQuAD2.0, which are datasets used for training question generation and answering models. 

In the **evaluation section**, the authors discuss the evaluation of the quiz generation system but do not introduce any new datasets. However, they do mention that the models were fine-tuned on SQuAD1.1 and SQuAD2.0, which are crucial datasets for their work.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **SQuAD1.1**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Zhang, J., Lopyrev, K., & Liang, P. (2016). *SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text*. In Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 2383–2392.

2. **SQuAD2.0**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Rajpurkar, P., Jin, Z., Yu, A., & Liang, P. (2018). *Know What You Don’t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), pages 784–789.

Since these datasets are integral to the methods described in the paper, I will ensure to include them in the final output.

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
