To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICE-Score: Instructing Large Language Models to Evaluate Code" by Terry Yue Zhuo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their metric on two different datasets: **CoNaLa** and **HumanEval-X**. This indicates that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiment setup** sections to gather more details about these datasets. In the **experiment setup** section, the authors explicitly state that they use the **CoNaLa dataset** for measuring human preference and the **HumanEval-X dataset** for evaluating functional correctness. This confirms their relevance to the experiments conducted.

Now, I will extract the specific details about each dataset:

1. **CoNaLa Dataset**: The paper describes it as a widely used dataset for natural language context to Python code generation, consisting of 2,860 annotated code snippets. The authors reference the original work by Yin et al. (2018) for this dataset.

2. **HumanEval-X Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as an extension of the original HumanEval benchmark, which includes natural language goals, input-output test cases, and reference solutions for coding problems. The authors reference Zheng et al. (2023) for this dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CoNaLa**, the citation is:
  > Pengcheng Yin, Bowen Deng, Edgar Chen, Bogdan Vasilescu, and Graham Neubig. *Learning to mine aligned code and natural language pairs from stack overflow*. In International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, MSR, pages 476â€“486, ACM, 2018.

- For **HumanEval-X**, the citation is:
  > Qinkai Zheng, Xiao Xia, Xu Zou, Yuxiao Dong, Shan Wang, Yufei Xue, Zihan Wang, Lei Shen, Andi Wang, Yang Li, et al. *Codegeex: A pre-trained model for code generation with multilingual evaluations on humaneval-x*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.17568, 2023.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information about each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help me accurately document the datasets used in the research paper.
