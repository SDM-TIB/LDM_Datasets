To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Understanding the Impact of Model Size on Differential Private Classification" by Yinchen Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on real data, which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using "common real data such as RCV1, CIFAR-10." This gives me the names of two datasets that are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the datasets used and gather more details. In section 4, the authors describe their experiments and explicitly mention using the **RCV1 dataset** and **CIFAR-10 dataset**. They provide context on how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, which is crucial for understanding their relevance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are important for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. For the **RCV1 dataset**, the citation is:
   > David D Lewis, Yiming Yang, Tony Russell-Rose, and Fan Li. *RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5:361â€“397, 2004.

2. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
