To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated detection of block falls in the north polar region of Mars" by L. Fanara et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors developed a method using NASA's HiRISE images, which suggests that these images are part of the dataset used for their analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **3.2.1 Data**. Here, the authors describe the specific HiRISE images they used for their study. They mention two grayscale HiRISE images taken at specific coordinates: **ESP_027750_2640_RED** (the 'before' image) and **ESP_036888_2640_RED** (the 'after' image). This indicates that these images are crucial components of their dataset for training and testing their change detection method.

I will also check the **results section** to see if the authors provide any additional context or details about the datasets used, but it seems that the primary focus is on the analysis of the images rather than additional datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the HiRISE images are part of a larger dataset managed by NASA, I will reference the HiRISE project as follows:

- For the HiRISE images, the citation is:
  > McEwen, A.S., Eliason, E.M., Bergstrom, J.W., Bridges, N.T., Hansen, C.J., Delamere, W.A., Grant, J.A., Gulick, V.C., Herkenhoff, K.E., Keszthelyi, L., Kirk, R.L., Mellon, M.T., Squyres, S.W., Thomas, N., Weitz, C.M. (2007). Mars Reconnaissance Orbiterâ€™s High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). *Journal of Geophysical Research*, 112. https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JE002605

With this information, I will create entries for the datasets used in the study, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
