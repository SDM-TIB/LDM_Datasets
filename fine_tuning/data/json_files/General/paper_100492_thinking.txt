To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Power-law escape rate of SGD" by Takashi Mori et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Background)** and **section 5 (Experiments)**. In these sections, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments or analyses.

In **section 2.1 (Setup)**, the authors define the training dataset \( D = \{(x(\mu), y(\mu)) : \mu = 1, 2, \ldots, N\} \), which indicates that they are using a dataset for supervised learning. However, they do not specify the source or name of this dataset in this section.

Moving to **section 5 (Experiments)**, I will look for any mentions of specific datasets used in their experiments. The authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for a binary classification problem, which is a well-known dataset in machine learning.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST dataset. The citation for the MNIST dataset is:

- **MNIST Dataset**:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

Additionally, I will verify if there are any other datasets mentioned in the experiments or results sections. If the authors refer to any other datasets, I will ensure to extract their names and corresponding citations as well.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
