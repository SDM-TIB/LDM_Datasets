To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the Generalization of Models Trained with SGD: Information-Theoretic Bounds and Implications" by Ziqiao Wang and Yongyi Mao, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research objectives.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is crucial as it usually contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics relevant to the study.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets. For instance, if the authors refer to datasets like "MNIST," "CIFAR-10," or "SVHN," I will note these down. I will also check for any descriptions that provide context about how these datasets were used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is important as it provides the necessary attribution and allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

For example, if the paper mentions the "CIFAR-10" dataset, I will look for its citation, which typically includes:
- The authors of the original dataset paper.
- The title of the dataset paper.
- The conference or journal where it was published.
- The year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information clearly, ready for any further processing or presentation as required.
