To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secondary Protein Structure Prediction Using Neural Networks" by Sidharth Malhotra and Robin Walters, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using datasets related to protein structures, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.3 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention the use of the **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**, which is a significant dataset containing structural data for proteins from various species.

In this section, the authors specify that they collected structural data for **30,000 human proteins** and **6,000 mouse proteins**. They also mention that they created species-specific datasets to enhance the similarity and patterning in their analysis. This indicates that the datasets are not only large but also tailored for their specific experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Protein Data Bank. The citation is as follows:
> Berman, H. M., Westbrook, J., Feng, Z., Gilliland, G., Bhat, T. N., Weissig, H., Shindyalov, I. N., and Bourne, P. E. *The Protein Data Bank*. Nucleic Acids Res 28 (2000), 235â€“242.

Since the authors did not provide separate citations for the human and mouse datasets, I will use the citation for the Protein Data Bank as the authoritative source for both datasets.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
