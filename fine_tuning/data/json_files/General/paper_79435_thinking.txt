To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asynchronous Stochastic Proximal Optimization Algorithms with Variance Reduction" by Qi Meng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on three benchmark datasets: **rcv1**, **real-sim**, and **news20**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their sizes and feature dimensions.

The paper provides the following information about the datasets:

1. **rcv1**: 
   - Data size: 20,242
   - Feature size: 47,236
   - Regularization parameters: λ1 = 10^-5, λ2 = 10^-4

2. **real-sim**: 
   - Data size: 72,309
   - Feature size: 20,958
   - Regularization parameters: λ1 = 10^-4, λ2 = 10^-4

3. **news20**: 
   - Data size: 19,996
   - Feature size: 1,355,191
   - Regularization parameters: λ1 = 10^-6, λ2 = 10^-4

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it is common for benchmark datasets to be cited in their original papers, so I will look for the original sources of these datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will provide the following citations based on common knowledge:

- **rcv1**: 
  > Lewis, D. D., Yang, Y., Rose, T. G., & Li, F. (2004). *RCV1: A New Benchmark Collection for Text Categorization Research*. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 5, 361-397.

- **real-sim**: 
  > Joachims, T. (2002). *Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory, and Algorithms*. Kluwer Academic Publishers.

- **news20**: 
  > Lang, K. J. (1995). *Newsweeder: Learning to Filter Netnews*. In Proceedings of the 1995 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 331-339.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that I have accurately captured the dataset names, sizes, feature dimensions, and full citations.
