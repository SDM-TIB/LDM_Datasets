To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flood Inflow Forecast Using â„“2-norm Ensemble Weighting Sea Surface Feature" by Takato Yasuno et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the importance of forecasting dam inflow and mentions the use of a "sea feature vector" extracted from analyzed images of the sea surface, which suggests that there may be datasets related to sea surface temperature or similar features.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (section 2) where the authors describe their approach to creating the sea temperature feature vector. They mention extracting 4,096 elements from the fc6 layer of the pre-trained VGG16 network, which indicates that they are using a specific dataset of sea surface images for this extraction. However, I need to find the exact source or dataset name.

In the **applied results section** (section 3), the authors discuss the application of their method to a dam in the Kanto region of Japan, focusing on data from 2007 to 2018 and testing accuracy over the 2019 flood term. This implies that there is a dataset of hydrological data collected over these years, but I need to confirm the specific datasets used.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that summarize the datasets or provide additional details about the data used in their experiments. For instance, the paper includes tables that describe the hydrological and meteorological data predictors, which may contain dataset names or references.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be accessed or referenced by others.

Based on my review, I will compile the following datasets:

1. **Sea Surface Temperature Dataset**: This dataset is implied to be derived from analyzed images of the sea surface, but I need to find the specific source or dataset name.
   
2. **Hydrological Data**: This dataset includes data collected from 2007 to 2018, specifically for dam inflow forecasting. I will need to identify the exact source or dataset name.

3. **Meteorological Data**: This dataset includes various meteorological predictors used in the study. Again, I will need to find the specific source or dataset name.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to write down their full citations as provided in the references section of the paper. This will include any relevant papers or datasets that the authors have cited.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and citations for clarity and completeness.
