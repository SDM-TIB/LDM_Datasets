To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLMRec: Large Language Models with Graph Augmentation for Recommendation" by Wei Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and evaluation sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges of data sparsity and the importance of side information in recommendation systems. They mention using publicly available datasets, specifically **Netflix** and **MovieLens**, for their experiments.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors provide statistical details about the datasets used. They mention that the **MovieLens dataset** is derived from ML-10M and includes side information such as movie title, year, and genre. The **Netflix dataset** is noted to include multi-modal side information collected through web crawling, with implicit feedback sourced from the Netflix Prize Data on Kaggle.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MovieLens Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > GroupLens Research. *MovieLens Datasets*. Available at: https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html

2. **Netflix Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Netflix, Inc. *Netflix Prize Data*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
