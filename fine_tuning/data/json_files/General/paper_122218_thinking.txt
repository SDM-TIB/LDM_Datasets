To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invariant Collaborative Filtering to Popularity Distribution Shift" by An Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they list the datasets along with their statistics, which is crucial for understanding the context in which they were used.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **Yahoo!R3**: This dataset is described as having 14,382 users, 1,000 items, and 129,748 interactions. The density is noted as 0.0090.

2. **Coat**: This dataset consists of 290 users, 295 items, and 2,776 interactions, with a density of 0.0324.

3. **Douban Movie**: This dataset has 36,644 users, 22,226 items, and 5,397,926 interactions, with a density of 0.0066.

4. **Meituan**: This dataset includes 67,529 users, 29,785 items, and 2,190,658 interactions, with a density of 0.0011.

5. **Yelp2018**: This dataset has 95,709 users, 41,602 items, and 2,937,228 interactions, with a density of 0.0007.

6. **Tencent**: This synthetic dataset is mentioned but does not have specific statistics provided in the same way as the others.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Yahoo!R3**: 
  > Marlin, B. M., & Zemel, R. S. (2009). Collaborative prediction and ranking with non-random missing data. In RecSys.

- **Coat**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
