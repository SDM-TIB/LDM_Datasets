To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Trustworthy Sensor Fusion against Inaudible Command Attacks in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems" by Jiwei Guan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the development of a Multimodal Fusion Framework (MFF) for detecting inaudible voice command attacks, which suggests that datasets related to audio and visual data might be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Dataset and Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention the creation of a development dataset consisting of:

1. **A2D2 Dataset**: This dataset is used for autonomous driving scenarios and includes driving videos with annotations for object detection and instance segmentation. It is noted for covering various driving scenarios and capturing large static objects.

2. **Google Speech Command Dataset**: This dataset consists of audio recordings of single spoken words, specifically the commands "go" and "stop," which are used for keyword spotting systems.

In this section, the authors provide details about how these datasets are utilized in their experiments, confirming their relevance to the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **A2D2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Geyer, Y. Kassahun, M. Mahmudi, X. Ricou, R. Durgesh, A. S. Chung, L. Hauswald, V. H. Pham, M. Mühlegg, S. Dorn, T. Fernandez, M. Jänicke, S. Mirashi, C. Savani, M. Sturm, O. Vorobiov, M. Oelker, S. Garreis, and P. Schuberth. *A2D2: Audi Autonomous Driving Dataset*. CoRR, vol. abs/2004.06320, 2020.

- For the **Google Speech Command Dataset**, the citation is:
  > P. Warden. *Speech Commands: A Dataset for Limited-Vocabulary Speech Recognition*. CoRR, vol. abs/1804.03209, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document each dataset's name, description, and full citation as required.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that all necessary details are included for each dataset extracted from the paper.
