To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Three Quantization Regimes for ReLU Networks" by Weigutian Ou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a concise overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this section typically details the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, or references to publicly available datasets.

If the datasets are not clearly named in the experiments section, I will check the **results and discussion sections** for any references to datasets that may have been used indirectly or in comparison to other works.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to gather the following information for each dataset:
1. **Name of the dataset**: This is crucial for identification.
2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the dataset contains, including the type of data (e.g., images, text, numerical data), the number of samples, and any relevant characteristics.
3. **Citation**: I will look for the full citation of the dataset in the **References section** of the paper. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

For example, if I find a dataset named "CIFAR-10", I will note its description (e.g., "A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class") and then find the citation, which might look like:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset*. 2009.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and results sections.
2. Identify and document each dataset's name, description, and citation.
3. Ensure that the citations are accurate and complete for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
