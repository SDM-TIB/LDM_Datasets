To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TranSMS: Transformers for Super-Resolution Calibration in Magnetic Particle Imaging" by Alper Güngör et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for calibration and imaging measurements.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Datasets**. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. I will look for specific names, sizes, and characteristics of the datasets.

In the **Methods section**, I find three datasets mentioned:

1. **Simulated Dataset**: This dataset is generated using an in-house MPI simulator and includes specific parameters such as field of view (FOV) size, grid size, and sample size. The details provided indicate that it is used for controlled analyses and ablation studies.

2. **Open MPI Dataset**: This is a public dataset that contains calibration and imaging measurements on a preclinical FFP scanner. The dataset includes specific FOV sizes and sample sizes, and it is analyzed for calibration data collected at different times.

3. **In-house MPI Dataset**: This dataset is collected on an open-sided ASELSAN FFL scanner and includes various parameters such as FOV size, sample size, and specific imaging protocols.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for proper attribution.

For the **Simulated Dataset**, since it is generated in-house, it may not have a formal citation. However, I will note that it is based on the methodology described in the paper.

For the **Open MPI Dataset**, the citation is:
> Knopp, T., Szwargulski, P., Griese, F., & Gräser, M. (2020). OpenMPIData: An initiative for freely accessible magnetic particle imaging data. *Data in Brief*, 28, 104971.

For the **In-house MPI Dataset**, it may also not have a formal citation, but I will note that it is based on the experimental setup described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations where applicable. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
