To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unrecognizable Yet Identifiable: Image Distortion with Preserved Embeddings" by Dmytro Zakharova et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors experimented on widely used datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors mention using the **MNIST** and **LFW** datasets for their experiments. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial to their research.

I will then look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any relevant sections that provide more details about these datasets. In this case, the authors describe the datasets in the introduction and methods sections. They mention:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for training various image processing systems. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Deng, L. (2012). The MNIST database of handwritten digit images for machine learning research. *IEEE Signal Processing Magazine*, 29(6), 141-142.

2. **LFW Dataset**: The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset is used for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Huang, G.B., Ramesh, M., Berg, T., & Learned-Miller, E. (2007). Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments. *Technical Report 07-49*, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details about each dataset, including their names and citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citations are included for each dataset.
