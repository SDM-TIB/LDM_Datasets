To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Compact CNN Structure Learning by Knowledge Distillation" by Waqar Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention three standard classification datasets: **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet**. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 tiny images of dimensions 32×32, categorized into 10 distinct classes. It includes 50,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset also contains 60,000 images of size 32×32, but it is categorized into 100 distinct classes. It has the same training and test set distribution as CIFAR-10.

3. **ImageNet**: This is a larger dataset consisting of 1 million images in the training set and 50,000 images in the test set, with images categorized into 1,000 classes and dimensions of 224×224.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Tech Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248–255, 2009.

Now that I have gathered all necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
