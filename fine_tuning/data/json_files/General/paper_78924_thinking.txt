To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving training of deep neural networks via Singular Value Bounding" by Kui Jia, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the author mentions experiments on benchmark image classification datasets, specifically **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **ImageNet**. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section (Section VI), the author explicitly states that they conducted experiments using **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **ImageNet**. The author provides details about the datasets, including their characteristics and the results achieved using these datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation for CIFAR10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**: The citation for CIFAR100 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Tech. Report, 2009. (CIFAR100 is derived from CIFAR10, so it shares the same citation.)

3. **ImageNet**: The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

After confirming the datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately for future reference or analysis.
