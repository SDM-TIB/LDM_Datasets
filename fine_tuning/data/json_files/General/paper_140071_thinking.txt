To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Design of an Open-Source Architecture for Neural Machine Translation" by SÃ©amus Lankford et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections that discuss the architecture and experiments** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the application, but I need to look deeper into the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Architecture of adaptNMT)**, where the authors describe the requirements for building translation models. They mention that the system requires **parallel text corpora for both the source and target languages**. This indicates that datasets are essential for the application, but I need to find specific examples.

In **section 4.1.4 (Use of subword segmentation)**, the authors discuss the ability for users to upload datasets that include train, validation, and test splits for both source and target languages. However, they do not specify any particular datasets by name. I will continue to search for any references to specific datasets in the paper.

In **section 5 (Discussion)**, the authors mention the importance of smaller, in-domain datasets for high-performing NMT models. They emphasize that the adaptNMT framework makes this approach accessible, but again, no specific datasets are cited.

Since the paper does not explicitly name any datasets, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets relevant to the research. However, the references primarily focus on methodologies and frameworks rather than specific datasets.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors do not provide specific dataset names or citations. Instead, they discuss the general need for parallel corpora in NMT without referencing particular datasets.

In conclusion, while I have thoroughly searched the paper for datasets, it seems that the authors have not included specific dataset names or citations. Therefore, I will note that no datasets were explicitly mentioned in this paper, and I will document this finding accordingly.
