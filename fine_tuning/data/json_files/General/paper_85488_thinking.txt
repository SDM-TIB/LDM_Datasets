To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explicit Shape Encoding for Real-Time Instance Segmentation" by Wenqiang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, ESE-Seg, is evaluated on standard public datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention that they evaluate their method on **Pascal VOC** and **COCO** datasets. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the context in which they are used.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their method on both datasets. They report mAP scores for Pascal VOC 2012 and COCO 2017, which confirms that these datasets are indeed used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Pascal VOC**:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, June 2010.

2. **COCO**:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C. Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Computer Vision – ECCV 2014, pages 740–755, Cham, 2014. Springer International Publishing.

With the dataset names and their citations identified, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **Pascal VOC**: A dataset used for object detection and segmentation tasks, providing annotated images for various object classes.
- **COCO**: A large-scale dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, featuring complex scenes with multiple objects.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
