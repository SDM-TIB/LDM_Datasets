To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Excitation Dropout: Encouraging Plasticity in Deep Neural Networks" by Andrea Zunino et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the contributions and may hint at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Architectures)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Cifar10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 RGB images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The training and test splits contain 50,000 and 10,000 images, respectively.

2. **Cifar100**: Similar to Cifar10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The training and test splits are also 50,000 and 10,000 images, respectively.

3. **Caltech256**: This dataset includes 31,000 RGB images across 256 classes. The authors mention using five different random splits of 50 training images and 20 testing images for each class.

4. **UCF101**: A video action recognition dataset containing 13,320 action videos across 101 action classes. The authors note that they sample two million frames from this dataset for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Cifar10** and **Cifar100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **Caltech256**, the citation is:
  > Greg Griffin, Abhinav Holub, and Pietro Perona. *Caltech-256 object category dataset*. Technical Report 7694, California Institute of Technology, 2007.

- For **UCF101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir R. Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
