To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Training Time Without Training" by Luca Zancato et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. Here, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention several datasets used for training time prediction. They specifically list:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 50,000 images across 10 classes.
2. **CIFAR-100**: A dataset containing 50,000 images across 100 classes.
3. **CUB-200**: A dataset with 5,994 images of birds across 200 classes.
4. **FGVC-Aircrafts**: A dataset with 6,667 images of aircraft across 100 classes.
5. **MIT-67**: A dataset with 5,360 images of indoor scenes across 67 classes.
6. **OpenSurfaces**: A dataset with 48,875 images for material recognition.
7. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset with 8,144 images of cars across 196 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
