To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretable Embedding for Ad-Hoc Video Search" by Jiaxin Wu and Chong-Wah Ngo, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate improvements on **TRECVid benchmarked datasets**, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention several datasets, including:

1. **MSR-VTT**: This dataset is referenced as a training set with 10,000 videos and 100,855 captions.
2. **TGIF**: Another dataset mentioned as part of the training set, with 200,000 videos and 124,534 captions.
3. **TV2016TRAIN**: This dataset is used as a validation set, containing 335,944 videos and 1,082,659 captions.
4. **MSVD**: This dataset is used for classification testing, with 1,907 videos and 80,837 captions.
5. **IACC.3**: This dataset is used for the AVS test set, which is part of the TRECVid evaluation.
6. **V3C1**: Another dataset mentioned for the AVS test set.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear understanding of the datasets used in the research and facilitate further exploration by others interested in this area.
