To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arabic Tweet Act: A Weighted Ensemble Pre-Trained Transformer Model for Classifying Arabic Speech Acts on Twitter" by Khadejaa Alshehri, Areej Alhothali, and Nahed Alowidi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors developed a new dataset by annotating a subset of an existing Arabic sentiment analysis dataset (ASAD) and evaluated their models on a previously developed Arabic Tweet Act dataset (ArSAS). This suggests that both datasets are relevant.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors describe the ASAD dataset, which consists of 100,000 tweets collected via the Twitter API, and they annotated 25,000 of these tweets into six speech act categories. They also mention the ArSAS dataset, which is used for comparison and is noted to be the first corpus with speech act labels for Arabic tweets.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for both datasets:

1. **ASAD Dataset**: The citation for the ASAD dataset is:
   > Alharbi, B., Alamro, H., Alshehri, M., Khayyat, Z., Kalkatawi, M., Jaber, I.I., & Zhang, X. (2020). ASAD: A Twitter-based benchmark Arabic sentiment analysis dataset. arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.00578.

2. **ArSAS Dataset**: The citation for the ArSAS dataset is:
   > Elmadany, A., Mubarak, H., & Magdy, W. (2018). ArSAS: An Arabic speech-act and sentiment corpus of tweets. OSACT 2018, 3, 20.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This includes ensuring that I have captured the key details about each dataset, such as their purpose, size, and any specific characteristics mentioned in the paper.
