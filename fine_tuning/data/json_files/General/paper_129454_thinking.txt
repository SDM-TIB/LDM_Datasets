To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilled Pruning: Using Synthetic Data to Win the Lottery" by Luke McDermott and Daniel Cummings, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "distilled datasets" which suggests that there are specific datasets involved in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the concept of distilled data and its application in neural network pruning. They mention that distilled datasets capture essential patterns from larger datasets, indicating that they are working with specific datasets, but I need to find their names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. They specifically mention using **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets for their experiments. The paper states that they distilled each class down to 10 or 50 images per class, which is crucial information for understanding the datasets used.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. 

The full citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images. 

The full citation for the CIFAR-100 dataset is:
> Krizhevsky, A. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images.

Both datasets are referenced in the same paper, which is a common source for these datasets.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is commonly used for training machine learning models.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images, but it is divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names and their full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future reference or processing.
