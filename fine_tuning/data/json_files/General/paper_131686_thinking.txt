To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distributionally Robust Machine Learning with Multi-source Data" by Zhenyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

1. **Initial Reading**: I will start by reading the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced or described. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the datasets used in the research.

2. **Identifying Datasets**: In the introduction, I will look for mentions of specific datasets or data sources. The authors may describe the datasets used for experiments or validation, which is crucial for understanding the context of their research.

3. **Detailed Sections**: I will then focus on sections that typically contain detailed information about datasets, such as **"Experiments," "Data," or "Methodology."** Here, the authors usually provide specifics about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

4. **Extracting Dataset Information**: As I identify datasets, I will take note of the following details for each:
   - **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset.
   - **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant characteristics (e.g., number of samples, features).
   - **Source**: Information about where the dataset can be accessed or who created it.

5. **Citations**: I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset. This is important for proper attribution and for readers who may want to access the datasets themselves.

6. **Compiling Information**: After gathering all necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, ensuring that I include the full citation for each dataset as per academic standards.

7. **Final Review**: Finally, I will review the extracted information to ensure accuracy and completeness before presenting it in the required format.

By following these steps, I will be able to systematically extract and document the datasets referenced in the research paper, ensuring that all relevant details and citations are included.
