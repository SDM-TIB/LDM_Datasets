To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Interpretations Steered Network Pruning via Amortized Inferred Saliency Maps" by Alireza Ganjdanesh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** benchmark datasets, indicating that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments** section, which is likely to provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this case, the authors explicitly state that they validated their proposed method on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This confirms that these two datasets are central to their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. (2009).

2. **ImageNet**:
   > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset with over 14 million images categorized into over 20,000 classes, widely used for image classification tasks.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its full citation.
