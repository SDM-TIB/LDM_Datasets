To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Union-net: Lightweight deep neural network model suitable for small data sets" by Jingyi Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using the **CIFAR-10** and **17 Flower** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets of interest.

Next, I will look closely at the **Materials & Methods section**, specifically subsection 2.2, where the authors describe their experimental settings. Here, they detail the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, explaining that it consists of 60,000 color images in 10 categories, with 5,000 images per category. They also mention that they created smaller datasets from CIFAR-10, specifically **CIFAR10_30**, **CIFAR10_60**, and **CIFAR10_100**, which are subsets containing 30, 60, and 100 samples per category, respectively.

In the same section, the authors describe the **17 Flower dataset**, which consists of 1,360 images across 17 flower categories, with 80 images per category. They note that this dataset is used for fine-grained classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
   > Krizhevsky, Alex. (2012). Convolutional Deep Belief Networks on CIFAR-10. https://core.ac.uk/display/21813460

2. For the **17 Flower dataset**, the citation is:
   > Nilsback, Maria Elena, and A. Zisserman. Automated Flower Classification over a Large Number of Classes. Sixth Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics & Image Processing, ICVGIP 2008, Bhubaneswar, India, 16-19 December 2008 IEEE, 2008.

Next, I will compile the information about the datasets, including their descriptions and citations, ensuring that I format it clearly for downstream processing.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 (32x32) color images in 10 categories, with 5,000 images per category.
- **CIFAR10_30, CIFAR10_60, CIFAR10_100**: Subsets of CIFAR-10 containing 30, 60, and 100 samples per category, respectively.
- **17 Flower**: A dataset of 1,360 images across 17 flower categories, with 80 images per category.

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset in the final output.
