To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Simultaneous Machine Translation with Monolingual Data" by Hexuan Deng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted preliminary experiments on En⇒Zh and En⇒Ja news domain corpora, which suggests that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they used the **CWMT Corpus** for the En⇒Zh translation task and **JParaCrawl** and **WikiMatrix** for the En⇒Ja task. This gives me the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, they provide details about the datasets:
1. **CWMT Corpus**: Used for training in the En⇒Zh direction, with specific references to its validation and test sets.
2. **JParaCrawl**: A large-scale web-based English-Japanese parallel corpus used for the En⇒Ja direction.
3. **WikiMatrix**: Another dataset used for the En⇒Ja translation task.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CWMT Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Chen, J., & Zhang, J. (2019). Machine Translation: 14th China Workshop, CWMT 2018, Wuyishan, China, October 25-26, 2018, Proceedings.

- For **JParaCrawl**, the citation is:
  > Morishita, M., Suzuki, J., & Nagata, M. (2020). JParaCrawl: A Large Scale Web-Based English-Japanese Parallel Corpus. In LREC.

- For **WikiMatrix**, the citation is:
  > Schwenk, H., Chaudhary, V., Sun, S., Gong, H., & Guzmán, F. (2021). WikiMatrix: Mining 135M Parallel Sentences in 1620 Language Pairs from Wikipedia. In EACL.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a clear and structured presentation of the datasets used in the research paper.
