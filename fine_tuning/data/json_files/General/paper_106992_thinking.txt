To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Full Transformer Framework for Robust Point Cloud Registration with Deep Information Interaction" by Guangyan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this case, they refer to the **ModelNet40 dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for point cloud registration tasks. The paper states that ModelNet40 includes 12,311 meshed CAD models across 40 categories, with a specific split for training and testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ModelNet40 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset. The reference for ModelNet40 is:

> Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 1912â€“1920, 2015.

Since the paper primarily discusses the ModelNet40 dataset, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will allow for easy reference and understanding of the dataset's relevance to the research.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
