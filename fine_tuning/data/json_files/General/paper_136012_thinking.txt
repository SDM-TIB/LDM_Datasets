To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computer Vision for Increased Operative Efficiency via Identification of Instruments in the Neurosurgical Operating Room: A Proof-of-Concept Study" by Tanner J. Zachem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected **1660 images of 27 commonly used neurosurgical instruments**, which suggests that this is the primary dataset used in their study.

Next, I will look into the **methods section**, specifically under the subsection titled "Instrument, Data Collection, and Data Preparation." Here, the authors describe how they obtained images of the surgical instruments, detailing that they took multiple images of each instrument from various angles and orientations. This confirms that the dataset consists of images of 27 different instruments, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset, such as the distribution of images per instrument. The paper mentions a total of **1660 images** collected, which is important for describing the dataset's size.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets but rather describes a custom dataset created by the authors, I will focus on documenting this dataset. The authors also mention that the data is openly available through The Open Science Framework, which is a significant detail for accessibility.

Now, I will gather the necessary citation information. The paper provides a DOI link for the dataset: **https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BCQK2**. This will serve as the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and citation. The dataset will be referred to as the "Neurosurgical Instruments Dataset," and I will describe it as containing images of 27 commonly used neurosurgical instruments, totaling 1660 images.

In summary, the steps I will take are:
1. Review the abstract and introduction for mentions of datasets.
2. Examine the methods section for details on data collection and preparation.
3. Confirm the dataset size and composition from the results section.
4. Note the DOI link for the dataset for citation purposes.
5. Compile the dataset information into a structured format for documentation.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the dataset from the research paper, including the necessary citation.
