To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge" by Yoonna Jang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of a dataset called **FoCus**, which is a strong indication that this is a primary dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **FoCus Dataset section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, including its purpose, structure, and how it was created. They mention that the dataset consists of **14,452 dialogues** that incorporate both user persona and Wikipedia knowledge, which is crucial for understanding its application.

In addition to the FoCus dataset, I will look for any other datasets referenced in the paper. The authors compare their dataset with others in **Table 1**, which lists several datasets used in conversational AI research. The datasets mentioned include:

1. **Wizard of Wikipedia**: A dataset that allows agents to generate responses based on Wikipedia knowledge.
2. **CMU-DoG**: A dataset focused on document-grounded conversations.
3. **PERSONA-CHAT**: A dataset that includes persona-based dialogues.

I will now gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For **FoCus Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yoonna Jang, Jungwoo Lim, Yuna Hur, Dongsuk Oh, Suhyune Son, Yeonsoo Lee, Donghoon Shin, Seungryong Kim, and Heuiseok Lim. *Call for Customized Conversation: Customized Conversation Grounding Persona and Knowledge*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2022.

- For **Wizard of Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Dinan, E., Roller, S., Shuster, K., Fan, A., Auli, M., and Weston, J. *Wizard of Wikipedia: Knowledge-Powered Conversational Agents*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.01241, 2018.

- For **CMU-DoG**, the citation is:
  > Zhou, K., Prabhumoye, S., and Black, A. W. *A Dataset for Document Grounded Conversations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.07358, 2018.

- For **PERSONA-CHAT**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, S., Dinan, E., Urbanek, J., Szlam, A., Kiela, D., and Weston, J. *Personalizing Dialogue Agents: I Have a Dog, Do You Have Pets Too?* arXiv preprint arXiv:1801.07243, 2018.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
