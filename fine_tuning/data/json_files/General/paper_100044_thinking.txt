To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Transformer and LSTM to Kalman Filter with EM algorithm for state estimation" by Zhuangwei Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset details. The introduction often discusses the context and may mention datasets used in prior work, which could be relevant.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others. If the authors reference existing datasets, I will look for the original papers or sources that describe these datasets to obtain their full citations.

In this particular paper, I will specifically look for any datasets related to the experiments conducted on the linear mobile robot model, as described in the experiments section. The authors may have used synthetic data generated from the model or real-world datasets for validation.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, including the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review, making sure to include all necessary details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
