To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-Standard Vietnamese Word Detection and Normalization for Text-to-Speech" by Huu-Tien Dang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a manually annotated dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their dataset in detail. They mention that they obtained a dataset consisting of **5819 labeled sentences** extracted from Vietnamese news articles, which contained **13472 non-standard words (NSWs)**. This dataset is crucial for understanding their experiments and results.

In addition, I will look for any references to other datasets or sources used in their experiments. The authors mention that they collected contact names from phone contact names and used a lexicon from various sources, including Vietnamese name databases and wordlists. However, the primary dataset they focus on is the one they manually annotated.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The paper does not provide a formal citation for the manually annotated dataset, but it does reference the sources from which they collected additional data:

1. **Vietnamese Named Database**: 
   > Available at: https://github.com/duyet/vietnamese-namedb

2. **Vietnamese Wordlists**: 
   > Available at: https://github.com/duyet/vietnamese-wordlist

3. **Underthesea Dictionaries**: 
   > Available at: https://github.com/undertheseanlp/underthesea

Since the main dataset is manually annotated and not formally published, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for the additional resources used in their experiments. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets referenced in the paper.
