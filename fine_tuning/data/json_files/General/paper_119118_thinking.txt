To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CRONOS: Colorization and Contrastive Learning for Device-Free NLoS Human Presence Detection using Wi-Fi CSI" by Li-Hsiang Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors often describe the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two main datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CSI Data for Human Presence Detection**: The authors collected their own dataset using Wi-Fi access points to capture channel state information (CSI) under various scenarios, including empty rooms, static non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases, static line-of-sight (LoS) cases, and dynamic cases. This dataset is crucial for training and evaluating their proposed CRONOS system.

2. **Existing Datasets for Comparison**: The authors also reference existing datasets in the literature for benchmarking their results. However, specific names or citations for these datasets are not provided in the text.

Next, I will check the **References section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references may include foundational datasets or previous works that the authors used for comparison or validation.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include full citations for any datasets mentioned. For the CSI dataset, since it is collected by the authors, I will note that it is a proprietary dataset created for this research. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, if applicable.

In conclusion, I will document the following datasets:

1. **CSI Data for Human Presence Detection**: A proprietary dataset collected by the authors using Wi-Fi access points to evaluate their CRONOS system.

2. **Existing Datasets**: Any referenced datasets from the literature will be noted, along with their citations if they are explicitly mentioned.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper citations for each.
