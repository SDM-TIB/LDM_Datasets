To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic fetal fat quantification from MRI" by Netanell Avisdris et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of a deep learning method for fetal fat segmentation based on Dixon MRI, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in the training and evaluation of the models. The introduction provides context about the importance of quantifying fetal adipose tissue and may reference specific datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their methodology for creating an annotated training dataset through a semi-automatic segmentation process. They mention that the dataset consists of **57 singleton fetuses** scanned between 31 and 39 weeks of gestation, which is crucial information for understanding the dataset's characteristics.

I will also check the **results** section to see if the authors provide any additional details about the datasets used for training and testing the deep learning models. They mention using **21 volumes for training** and **6 volumes for validation**, with **24 volumes tested**. This indicates a structured dataset split, which is important for reproducibility.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. The paper does not explicitly cite external datasets but provides details about the data acquisition process, including the use of **3T MRI scanners** and specific imaging sequences (TRUFI and Dixon). I will note these details as they pertain to the dataset's creation.

Since the paper does not reference external datasets, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Annotated Training Dataset**: This dataset consists of 57 singleton fetuses, with MRI scans performed at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. The dataset was created through a semi-automatic segmentation process, reviewed by radiologists.

2. **Training and Testing Volumes**: The authors used 21 volumes for training, 6 for validation, and 24 for testing the deep learning models.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details about the datasets, even if they are not traditional datasets with external citations. The focus will be on the methodology and the specifics of the dataset used in the study.
