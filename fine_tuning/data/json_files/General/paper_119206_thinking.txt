To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Decoding Attention from Gaze: A Benchmark Dataset and End-to-End Models" by Karan Uppal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors provide a publicly available dataset called the **Multiple Object Eye-Tracking (MOET)** dataset, which is a strong lead for my extraction.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (The Multiple Object Eye-Tracking (MOET) dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, I will note the key characteristics of the MOET dataset, including its purpose, the number of participants, the types of videos used, and the annotations provided.

The MOET dataset is described as consisting of eye-tracking data collected from participants viewing videos from the **Multiple Object Tracking 2016 (MOT16)** benchmark dataset. This is crucial as it indicates that the MOET dataset is built upon another dataset, which I need to cite as well.

In the **data collection section**, the authors mention that the MOET dataset includes gaze data from 16 participants tracking distinct target objects in 14 videos, with annotations for class labels and bounding boxes. This information will help me describe the dataset comprehensively.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for both the MOET dataset and the MOT16 dataset. The citation for the MOET dataset is not explicitly provided in the references, but since it is publicly available, I will note its access link: https://osf.io/28rnx/. For the MOT16 dataset, the citation is:

- Milan, et al. (2016). *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

Now, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets:

1. **Multiple Object Eye-Tracking (MOET) Dataset**:
   - Description: A dataset consisting of eye-tracking data collected from participants viewing videos from the MOT16 benchmark dataset, annotated with labels and bounding boxes for objects participants were assigned to track.
   - Citation: Available at https://osf.io/28rnx/.

2. **MOT16 Dataset**:
   - Description: A widely used benchmark dataset for multiple object tracking, consisting of 14 videos with a total of 11,221 frames.
   - Citation: Milan, et al. (2016). *MOT16: A benchmark for multi-object tracking*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.00831.

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that it is presented clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or review.
