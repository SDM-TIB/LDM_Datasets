To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SocialDial: A Benchmark for Socially-Aware Dialogue Systems" by Haolan Zhan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper presents a socially-aware dialogue corpus called **SocialDial**, which is a strong lead for the dataset I need to extract.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **main body of the paper**, particularly in sections that discuss the methodology or data collection. In this case, the authors describe **SocialDial** as consisting of two parts: 

1. **1,563 human-written dialogues** collected through crowd-sourcing, annotated with social factors.
2. **4,870 synthetic dialogues** generated by ChatGPT, also annotated with social factors.

I will note the details about the dataset, including the number of dialogues and the methods used for data collection and annotation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper itself serves as the primary source for the **SocialDial** dataset, so I will cite it accordingly.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Haolan Zhan, Zhuang Li, Yufei Wang, Linhao Luo, Tao Feng, Xiaoxi Kang, Yuncheng Hua, Lizhen Qu, Lay-Ki Soon, Suraj Sharma, Ingrid Zukerman, Zhaleh Semnani-Azad, Gholamreza Haffari. 2023. SocialDial: A Benchmark for Socially-Aware Dialogue Systems. In Proceedings of the 46th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR ’23), July 23–27, 2023, Taipei, Taiwan. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3539618.3591877

Finally, I will compile the extracted information about the **SocialDial** dataset, ensuring that I include the dataset's name, description, and the full citation in a structured format for further processing or review.
