To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automatic Gradient Descent: Deep Learning without Hyperparameters" by Jeremy Bernstein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the paper evaluates the proposed method on large datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3.3) where the authors describe the datasets used for testing their method. Here, they specifically mention using the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **ImageNet** datasets. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the experiments section, the authors state:
- **CIFAR-10**: A dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
- **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset used for image classification, containing millions of images across thousands of categories.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.
  
- For **ImageNet**:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research paper.
