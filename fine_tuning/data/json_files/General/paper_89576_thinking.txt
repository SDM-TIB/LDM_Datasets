To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Performance Aware Convolutional Neural Network: Channel Pruning for Embedded GPUs" by Valentin Radu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of model compression techniques, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section III), where the authors describe the neural network libraries and models used in their experiments. Here, they mention three popular deep neural networks: **ResNet-50**, **VGG-16**, and **AlexNet**. However, I need to check if they refer to any specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

I will then examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used in their experiments. If they mention any datasets, I will take note of their names and descriptions.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

If the authors refer to well-known datasets, such as ImageNet or CIFAR-10, I will ensure to include their standard citations. If they introduce new datasets or specific subsets of existing datasets, I will extract the full citation details as provided in the paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
