To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Shallow Networks for High-Accuracy Road Object-Detection" by Khalid Ashraf et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of detecting vehicles for autonomous driving, which suggests that datasets related to vehicle detection might be included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. Here, they state that they used the **KITTI object detection dataset**. This is a significant finding, as it indicates the primary dataset utilized in their research.

In this section, the authors provide details about the KITTI dataset, including its categories (car, pedestrian, bicyclists) and the number of images available for training and testing. They also mention the evaluation criteria based on the intersection over union (IoU) with ground truth bounding boxes.

Now, I will locate the **References section** to find the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The citation is as follows:
> A. Geiger, P. Lenz, and R. Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Since the KITTI dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, including its citation, into a structured format for further use.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and ready for any downstream processing or review.
