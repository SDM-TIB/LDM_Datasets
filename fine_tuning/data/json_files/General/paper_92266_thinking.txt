To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking the Role of Gradient-Based Attribution Methods for Model Interpretability" by Suraj Srinivas and FranÃ§ois Fleuret, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically detail the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR100 dataset** for their experiments. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its size, characteristics, and any relevant splits or configurations used in the experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors state that they conducted experiments using the CIFAR100 dataset, which consists of 100 classes with 600 images per class. This dataset is commonly used for evaluating image classification algorithms, and its characteristics are well-known in the machine learning community.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR100 dataset. The citation for the CIFAR100 dataset is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CIFAR100 dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for the CIFAR100 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or downstream processing.
