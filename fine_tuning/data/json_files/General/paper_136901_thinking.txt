To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Biased Transformer for Robust Multi-View 3D Human Pose Reconstruction" by Olivier Moliner et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three benchmark public datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look closely at **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention the three datasets:

1. **Human3.6M**: This dataset consists of 3.6 million images of 11 subjects performing various activities in an indoor environment, with corresponding 3D pose annotations. The images are captured at 50 Hz by 4 synchronized cameras. The citation for this dataset is:
   > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6M: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3D human sensing in natural environments*. IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 36(7):1325–1339, July 2014.

2. **CMU Panoptic**: This dataset contains multiple scenes where people perform different activities, captured by hundreds of cameras. The 3D pose annotations are obtained through triangulation. The citation for this dataset is:
   > H. Joo, T. Simon, X. Li, H. Liu, L. Tan, L. Gui, S. Banerjee, T. Godisart, B. Nabbe, I. Matthews, T. Kanade, S. Nobuhara, and Y. Sheikh. *Panoptic studio: A massively multiview system for social interaction capture*. IEEE Transactions on, Dec. 2016.

3. **Occlusion-Person**: This is a synthetic dataset rendered with UnrealCV, featuring human models in scenes with occluding objects, captured by multiple cameras. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Z. Zhang, C. Wang, W. Qiu, W. Qin, and W. Zeng. *Adafuse: Adaptive multiview fusion for accurate human pose estimation in the wild*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 129:703 – 718, 2020.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their specific characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments, as this information is crucial for understanding the context of the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accompanied by its full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research reference.
