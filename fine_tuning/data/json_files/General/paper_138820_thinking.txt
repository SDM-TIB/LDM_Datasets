To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Todyformer: Towards Holistic Dynamic Graph Transformers with Structure-Aware Tokenization" by Mahdi Biparva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that "Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that Todyformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for downstream tasks." This indicates that datasets are indeed used, but I need to find their specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section (Section 4)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for their experiments. In **subsection 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly list the datasets for the Future Link Prediction (FLP) task:

1. **MOOC**: A dataset used for evaluating the model's performance in predicting future links.
2. **LastFM**: Another dataset utilized for the same purpose.
3. **SocialEvolution**: This dataset is also mentioned as part of the evaluation.
4. **Enron**: Included in the experiments for FLP.
5. **UCI**: Another dataset used for the FLP task.

Additionally, the authors mention datasets for the Dynamic Node Classification (DNC) task, which includes:

1. **Wikipedia**: Used for evaluating node classification.
2. **Reddit**: Another dataset for the DNC task.
3. **MOOC**: Also used for DNC, confirming its dual role in both tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper documentation:

- For **MOOC**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, S., Zhang, X., & Leskovec, J. (2019). Predicting dynamic embedding trajectory in temporal interaction networks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining.

- For **LastFM**, the citation is:
  > Kumar, S., Zhang, X., & Leskovec, J. (2019). Predicting dynamic embedding trajectory in temporal interaction networks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining.

- For **SocialEvolution**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chang, Y.-Y., Liu, Y., Leskovec, J., & Li, P. (2021). Inductive representation learning in temporal networks via causal anonymous walks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Learning Representations.

- For **Enron**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chang, Y.-Y., Liu, Y., Leskovec, J., & Li, P. (2021). Inductive representation learning in temporal networks via causal anonymous walks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Learning Representations.

- For **UCI**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chang, Y.-Y., Liu, Y., Leskovec, J., & Li, P. (2021). Inductive representation learning in temporal networks via causal anonymous walks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Learning Representations.

- For **Wikipedia**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chang, Y.-Y., Liu, Y., Leskovec, J., & Li, P. (2021). Inductive representation learning in temporal networks via causal anonymous walks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Learning Representations.

- For **Reddit**, the citation is:
  > Wang, Y., Chang, Y.-Y., Liu, Y., Leskovec, J., & Li, P. (2021). Inductive representation learning in temporal networks via causal anonymous walks. In Proc. Int. Conf. on Learning Representations.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets referenced in the paper along with their proper citations.
