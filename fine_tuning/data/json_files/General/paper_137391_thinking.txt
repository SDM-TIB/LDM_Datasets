To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SENet: Visual Detection of Online Social Engineering Attack Campaigns" by Irfan Ozen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the SEShield framework, which includes a component called SECrawler that collects examples of social engineering (SE) attacks. This suggests that there may be a dataset associated with this component.

Next, I will focus on **section 3.1 (SECrawler)**, where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that SECrawler collects examples of SE attack campaigns and provides details about the number of screenshots and the labeling process. Here, they state that they collected a total of **7,484 labeled SE attack pages** from **74 different SE attack campaigns**. This is a clear indication of a dataset.

In **section 4.1 (SECrawler Setup)**, the authors provide a summary of the dataset, which includes the number of campaigns, screen resolutions, and screenshots collected. They also mention that they collected **396,255 distinct screenshots** of benign webpages, which is another dataset.

Now, I will compile the details of the datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **SE Attack Dataset**: This dataset consists of 7,484 labeled SE attack pages collected from 74 different SE attack campaigns. The authors describe the systematic labeling process used to ensure high-quality ground truth.

2. **Benign Webpage Dataset**: This dataset includes 396,255 distinct screenshots of benign webpages collected from popular websites.

Next, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the methodology. Therefore, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' own collection methods and do not have separate citations.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant details, ensuring to include the context in which they were collected and their significance in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing.
