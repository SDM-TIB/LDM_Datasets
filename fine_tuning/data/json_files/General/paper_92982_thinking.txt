To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REPrune: Filter Pruning via Representative Election" by Mincheol Park, Woojeong Kim, and Suhyun Kim, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental analysis sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of their work and may mention datasets relevant to their experiments. I will pay attention to any specific datasets that are highlighted.

Next, I will examine the **experimental analysis section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on **CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet**. I will gather details about these datasets, such as their size, number of classes, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

For each dataset, I will ensure to find the full citation in the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide a complete understanding of the datasets used.

1. **CIFAR-10**: The authors mention that CIFAR-10 contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, divided into 10 classes with an image size of 32x32 pixels. The citation for CIFAR-10 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 also contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, but it is divided into 100 classes. The citation for CIFAR-100 is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **ImageNet**: The authors describe ImageNet as a large-scale dataset with 1.27 million training images and 50,000 validation images, categorized into 1,000 classes. The citation for ImageNet is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
