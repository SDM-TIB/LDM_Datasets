To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Application of Deep Learning for Sweet Cherry Phenotyping using YOLO Object Detection" by Ritayu Nagpal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the development of a method for counting sweet cherry fruits using YOLO, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved in training or testing the model.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Model Development and Data)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their models. Here, they mention that they used **360 raw JPEG images** containing cherries, which were annotated for training purposes. This is a clear indication of a dataset being utilized.

In this section, the authors also specify that the images were provided by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, which is crucial for citing the dataset correctly. They detail the process of manually annotating the images using the LabelImg library, which further confirms the dataset's relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors do not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, but they do mention the organization that provided the images. Therefore, I will cite the organization as follows:

- **Dataset**: Cherry Image Dataset
  > Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. *Test images for cherry phenotyping*. Available: [https://www.agr.gc.ca](https://www.agr.gc.ca).

Since the dataset is derived from images provided by a government agency, this citation will suffice for referencing the dataset used in the study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name and the full citation as required. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or use in related research.
