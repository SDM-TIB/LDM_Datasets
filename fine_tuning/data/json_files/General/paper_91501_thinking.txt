To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the Gravitational Force Law and Other Analytic Functions" by Atish Agarwala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the learning of functions, including the gravitational force function, but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their empirical validation. Here, they mention creating synthetic datasets by randomly drawing k points from [0, 1]Â³ corresponding to the locations of k bodies and computing the gravitational force on a target body. This indicates that there is a dataset generated for their experiments.

I will also check the **methodology** or **results sections** for any additional datasets used or referenced. In the experiments, they specifically mention generating 5 million examples, each with 4(k + 1) features corresponding to the location and mass of each body, and a single label corresponding to the gravitational force on the target body. This provides a clear description of the dataset structure.

Now, I will compile the details of the dataset:

1. **Synthetic Gravitational Force Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5 million examples, where each example includes features for the locations and masses of k bodies in a 3-dimensional space, along with a label for the gravitational force on a target body.

Next, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since this dataset is synthetic and generated by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like other datasets.

Since the dataset is described in detail within the paper but does not have an external citation, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of this research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential for proper attribution.

The citation for the paper is:
> Atish Agarwala, Abhimanyu Das, Rina Panigrahy, Qiuyi Zhang. *Learning the Gravitational Force Law and Other Analytic Functions*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Learning Theory, 2023.

Now, I will compile the dataset information and the citation into a structured format for further processing.
