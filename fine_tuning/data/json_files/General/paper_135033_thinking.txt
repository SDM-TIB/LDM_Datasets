To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Prompting Large Language Models as Explainable Metrics" by Ghazaleh Mahmoudi, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses a shared task involving evaluation metrics for summarization, which suggests that datasets may be involved in the experiments.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Task Description)**, where the author describes the shared task and mentions the use of **SummEval** as the evaluation benchmark for summarization. This is a strong indication that SummEval is a dataset used in the experiments.

In **section 3.1 (Data)**, the author explicitly states that the shared task organizers opted for **SummEval** during the training and development phase. The section provides details about SummEval, including its purpose and the dimensions on which summaries are rated. This confirms that SummEval is indeed a dataset used in the research.

Additionally, the author mentions that the **CNN/DailyMail dataset** is used for constructing SummEval. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

I will also check the **References section** to gather full citations for both datasets mentioned:

1. **SummEval**: The citation is:
   > Alexander R. Fabbri, Wojciech Kryściński, Bryan McCann, Caiming Xiong, Richard Socher, and Dragomir Radev. *SummEval: Re-evaluating Summarization Evaluation*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:391–409, 2021.

2. **CNN/DailyMail dataset**: The citation is:
   > Karl Moritz Hermann, Tomáš Kočiský, Edward Grefenstette, Lasse Espeholt, Will Kay, Mustafa Suleyman, and Phil Blunsom. *Teaching machines to read and comprehend*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), pages 1693–1701, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research paper along with their proper citations.
