To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fire Together Wire Together: A Dynamic Pruning Approach with Self-Supervised Mask Prediction" by Sara Elkerdawy et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on **CIFAR** and **ImageNet** datasets, indicating that these are likely the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the **experiments** section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This confirms that these datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will gather more details about each dataset. The paper mentions that the CIFAR-10 dataset is used with various architectures like VGG16-BN and ResNet56, while ImageNet is used with ResNet18 and ResNet34. However, specific details about the datasets themselves (like the number of classes or images) are not provided in the text.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly cited as follows:
- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. 

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10** with citation: 
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.
   
2. **ImageNet** with citation:
   > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

This step-by-step process ensures that I have accurately extracted the datasets and their full citations from the research paper.
