To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "STEP CATFormer: Spatial-Temporal Effective Body-Part Cross Attention Transformer for Skeleton-based Action Recognition" by Bao Long Nguyen Huu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors highlight that their method achieves high performance on the **NTU RGB+D** and **NTU RGB+D 120** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, they describe the two datasets as follows:

1. **NTU RGB+D**: This dataset consists of 56,880 sequences of human actions based on skeleton data. It includes two evaluation benchmarks: Cross-Subject (X-Sub) and Cross-View (X-View), with specific details about the training and test sets.

2. **NTU RGB+D 120**: An extended version of the NTU RGB+D dataset, this dataset contains an additional 57,367 skeleton sequences across 60 new action classes, totaling 120 action classes. The authors also mention two benchmark evaluations for this dataset: Cross-Subject and Cross-Setup.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **NTU RGB+D**, the citation is:
  > Amir Shahroudy, Jun Liu, Tian-Tsong Ng, and Gang Wang. *NTU RGB+D: A large scale dataset for 3D human activity analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2016.

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), May 2019.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
