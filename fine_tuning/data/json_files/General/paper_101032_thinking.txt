To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention Temperature Matters in Abstractive Summarization Distillation" by Shengqiang Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three summarization datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, I will look for the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics that the authors provide.

The datasets mentioned in this section are:

1. **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**: This dataset contains online news articles from CNN and DailyMail paired with their associated highlights as reference summaries. The authors mention the number of document-summary pairs for training, validation, and test sets.

2. **XSum Dataset**: This dataset is collected from BBC articles and consists of single-sentence summaries that are professionally written. The authors provide the number of articles for training, validation, and test sets.

3. **New York Times Dataset**: This dataset comprises articles published by the New York Times, with summaries written by library scientists. The authors detail the number of articles in the dataset after applying their preprocessing procedures.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CNN/DailyMail Dataset**:
  > Hermann, K., Kociský, T., Grefenstette, E., Espeholt, L., Kay, W., Suleyman, M., & Blunsom, P. (2015). Teaching machines to read and comprehend. In NIPS.

- **XSum Dataset**:
  > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). Don’t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization. In EMNLP.

- **New York Times Dataset**:
  > Sandhaus, E. (2008). The New York Times annotated corpus. Linguistic Data Consortium.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
