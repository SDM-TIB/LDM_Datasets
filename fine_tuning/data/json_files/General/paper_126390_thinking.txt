To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of Vision-Language Models and their Performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge" by Bryan Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the "Hateful Memes Challenge," which suggests that there is a specific dataset associated with this challenge. I will note this as a potential dataset.

Next, I will look closely at the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the dataset in more detail. They describe the dataset as comprising 10,000 memes, each with an image, text, and a label indicating whether it is hateful or not. This confirms that the Hateful Memes dataset is indeed a key dataset used in their research.

I will then proceed to the **data preparation and manipulation** section, where the authors provide further details about how the dataset is structured. They mention that the dataset is split into training, development, and test sets, which is important for understanding its use in experiments.

After gathering this information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Hateful Memes Challenge dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **Hateful Memes Challenge dataset**, the citation is:
  > Douwe Kiela, Hamed Firooz, Aravind Mohan, Vedanuj Goswami, Amanpreet Singh, Pratik Ringshia, and Davide Testuggine. *The hateful memes challenge: Detecting hate speech in multimodal memes*. CoRR, abs/2005.04790, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Hateful Memes Dataset**: This dataset consists of 10,000 memes, each containing an image, text, and a label (hateful or not). It is split into training, development, and test sets, with specific proportions for each category.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is crucial for academic integrity and proper referencing.
