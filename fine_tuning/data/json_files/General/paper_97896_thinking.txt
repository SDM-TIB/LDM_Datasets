To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Regression Oracles and Exploration Strategies for Short-Horizon Multi-Armed Bandits" by Robert C. Gray et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often discusses the context and relevance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention using data from a Mechanical Turk experiment conducted in 2016 by Furberg et al. This indicates that there is a dataset related to daily steps collected from participants, which is crucial for the experiments described in the paper.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section III (Simulation Environments)** and **section IV (Approach)**. In these sections, the authors describe two simulation environments that utilize data from the Mechanical Turk experiment:

1. **Mechanical Turk Dataset**: This dataset consists of daily step counts collected from participants using a Fitbit. The authors mention that after removing outliers, they have 1,665 valid data points. This dataset is used to model human step behavior in their simulations.

2. **Gamma Distribution**: While not a dataset in the traditional sense, the authors fit a Gamma distribution to the step data to simulate daily steps in their experiments. They reference the parameters used for this distribution, which are derived from the Mechanical Turk dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Mechanical Turk dataset. The relevant citation is:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
