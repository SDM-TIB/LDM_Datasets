To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain-Specific Risk Minimization for Domain Generalization" by Yi-Fan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this section typically contains the most comprehensive information about the datasets used in the study. I will look for subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." Here, the authors usually describe the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations used in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

In this paper, I expect to find mentions of several datasets, including:

1. **Colored MNIST**: A dataset derived from the MNIST dataset, modified to include color variations and label noise.
2. **Rotated MNIST**: A dataset consisting of MNIST digits rotated at various angles.
3. **PACS**: A dataset containing images from different domains, each representing various classes.
4. **VLCS**: A dataset composed of images from multiple domains and classes.
5. **DomainNet**: A large dataset with images from various domains and a wide range of classes.

Once I have gathered the necessary information about each dataset, I will compile the full citations for each dataset as follows:

- For **Colored MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Ghifary, M., Kleijn, W. B., Zhang, M., & Balduzzi, D. (2015). Domain generalization for object recognition with multi-task autoencoders. In ICCV.

- For **Rotated MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Ghifary, M., Kleijn, W. B., Zhang, M., & Balduzzi, D. (2015). Domain generalization for object recognition with multi-task autoencoders. In ICCV.

- For **PACS**, the citation is:
  > Li, D., Yang, Y., Song, Y.-Z., & Hospedales, T. M. (2017). Deeper, broader and artier domain generalization. In ICCV.

- For **VLCS**, the citation is:
  > Torralba, A., & Efros, A. A. (2011). Unbiased look at dataset bias. In CVPR.

- For **DomainNet**, the citation is:
  > Peng, X., Bai, Q., Xia, X., Huang, Z., Saenko, K., & Wang, B. (2019). Moment matching for multi-source domain adaptation. In ICCV.

After compiling this information, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation, ready for inclusion in any structured output or further analysis.
