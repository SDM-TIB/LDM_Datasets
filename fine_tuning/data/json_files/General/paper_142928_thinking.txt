To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimization without Retraction on the Random Generalized Stiefel Manifold" by Simon Vary et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors usually detail the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics (e.g., number of samples, dimensions, etc.).

In this paper, the authors mention using datasets for experiments related to **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** and **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**. Specifically, they refer to the **MNIST dataset** for the stochastic CCA experiments and a synthetic dataset for the stochastic ICA experiments. 

I will now gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation for the MNIST dataset is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: The authors do not provide a specific citation for the synthetic dataset used in their experiments, as it is generated based on a specific method described in the paper. However, I will note that it is a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of the study.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are ready for any downstream processing or review, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation of the datasets used in the research.
