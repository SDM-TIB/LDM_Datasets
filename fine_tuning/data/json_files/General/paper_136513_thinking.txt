To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Kernel Function for Learning Architecture in AI" by Himanshu Singh, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets used for experiments or comparisons.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Empirical Evidence and Results Comparison)**, as this section typically contains detailed descriptions of the experiments conducted, including any datasets utilized. I will pay particular attention to subsections like **4.1 (Kernel Regression)**, **4.2 (Support Vector Machine)**, and **4.3 (Neural Network)**, as they may explicitly mention datasets used for training or testing the models.

In subsection **4.3.2 (DCNN)**, the author mentions using "1500-28x28 gray-scale letter images of A, B, and C in a 4-D array." This indicates a specific dataset used for the deep convolutional neural network experiments. I will note this dataset and its characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are not directly cited in the references, I will look for any relevant papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail.

For the dataset identified:
1. **Gray-scale letter images dataset**: This dataset consists of 1500 images of letters A, B, and C, formatted in a 4-D array. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset, so I will need to acknowledge that it may be a custom dataset or derived from a known source.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited where applicable. If no citation is available, I will note that as well.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and proper citation.
