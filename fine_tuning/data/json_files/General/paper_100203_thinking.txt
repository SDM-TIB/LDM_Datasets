To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In-Hindsight Quantization Range Estimation for Quantized Training" by Marios Fournarakis and Markus Nagel, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method is evaluated on **image classification benchmarks (Tiny ImageNet & ImageNet)**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look closely at the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. They explicitly state that they conduct experiments on **Tiny ImageNet** and **ImageNet**, confirming that these are the datasets utilized for their method's validation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Tiny ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le and X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. 2015.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, Alexander C. Berg, and Li Fei-Fei. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that the full citations are included as required. This will allow for proper documentation and referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
