To extract datasets from the research paper titled "M&M Mix: A Multimodal Multiview Transformer Ensemble" by Xuehan Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors participated in the **2022 Epic-Kitchens Action Recognition Challenge**, which suggests that the Epic-Kitchens dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In section 3.1, the authors mention that they trained their models on **Kinetics 400**, **Kinetics 700**, and **WTS** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

I will then look for specific descriptions of each dataset in the text. In section 3.1, the authors provide the following details:

1. **Kinetics 400**: This dataset consists of 230,000 video clips, each 10 seconds long, focusing on human actions with labels for 400 classes.
2. **Kinetics 700**: Similar to Kinetics 400, this dataset contains 530,000 video clips, each labeled with one of 700 classes.
3. **WTS**: This dataset contains 60 million videos with only video-level labels, making it a large-scale weakly supervised dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Kinetics 400**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For **Kinetics 700**, the citation is the same as Kinetics 400, as it is part of the same dataset family:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. In arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

- For **WTS**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan C. Stroud, Zhichao Lu, Chen Sun, Jia Deng, Rahul Sukthankar, Cordelia Schmid, and David A. Ross. *Learning video representations from textual web supervision*. In arXiv 2007.14937, 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
