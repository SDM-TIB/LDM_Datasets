To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Anomaly Detection with Budget Annotation Using Semi-Supervised Residual Transformer" by Hanxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors reference their method's performance on the **MVTec-AD dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors state that their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three well-known anomaly detection datasets: **MVTec-AD**, **BTAD**, and **KolektorSDD2**. This confirms that these datasets are integral to their research.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

1. **MVTec-AD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Bergmann, P., Fauser, M., Sattlegger, D., & Steger, C. (2019). MVTec AD—A comprehensive real-world dataset for unsupervised anomaly detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 9592–9600.

2. **BTAD Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mishra, P., Verk, R., Fornasier, D., Piciarelli, C., & Foresti, G. L. (2021). BeanTech Anomaly Detection (BTAD): A vision transformer network for image anomaly detection and localization. In 2021 IEEE 30th International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE), pp. 01–06.

3. **KolektorSDD2 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Božič, J., Tabernik, D., & Skočaj, D. (2021). Mixed supervision for surface-defect detection: From weakly to fully supervised learning. Computers in Industry, 129, 103459.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and provide proper references for each.
