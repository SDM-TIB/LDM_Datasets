To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality: How Machine Learning Can Guide Forest Management" by Lorenzo Tomaselli et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of machine learning to analyze smoke types, which suggests that there may be datasets related to smoke samples.

In the **introduction**, the authors highlight the need for understanding the impact of wildland burns on air quality and mention the collection of smoke samples. This indicates that there are datasets related to these samples, but I need to find specific details.

Next, I will focus on the **data section** where the authors describe their methodology for collecting smoke samples. They mention collecting a total of **54 prescribed burn smoke samples** at Blodgett Forest Research Station in 2017, which is a clear dataset. They also indicate plans to collect an additional **âˆ¼100 smoke samples** during future prescribed burns.

The paper describes the analysis of these smoke samples using two-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, which suggests that the dataset includes detailed chemical composition data of the smoke.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to their own work and other studies that may provide context or additional datasets related to smoke analysis.

The relevant citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Prescribed Burn Smoke Samples**: The dataset is described in the paper itself, but it does not have a formal citation since it is original research. However, I can summarize it as:
   > Tomaselli, L., Jen, C., & Lee, A. B. (2020). Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality: How Machine Learning Can Guide Forest Management. In Proceedings of the Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.

2. **Chemical Fingerprinting Data**: The methodology for analyzing the smoke samples is based on existing techniques, but the dataset itself is original to this research. Therefore, it will also be cited as:
   > Tomaselli, L., Jen, C., & Lee, A. B. (2020). Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality: How Machine Learning Can Guide Forest Management. In Proceedings of the Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the appropriate citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
