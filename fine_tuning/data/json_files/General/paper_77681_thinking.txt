To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Neural Stochastic Volatility Model" by Rui Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and conclusion sections** to gather information about any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "real-world stock price datasets," which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used. In this section, they specify that the dataset comprises **162 univariate time series of daily closing stock prices** collected from three institutions. They also describe the criteria for selecting these stocks, such as their listing date and the number of suspension days.

I will note the specific details provided about the dataset:
- The dataset consists of **2000 series of d-dimensional normalized log-return vectors** of length 2570, which corresponds to approximately 7 years of data.
- The authors mention that they divided the dataset into training and testing subsets, with the first 2000 time steps used for training and the remaining 570 for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for any datasets or related works mentioned. However, since the dataset is described as a collection of stock prices and does not have a specific citation like a publicly available dataset, I will summarize the information as follows:

1. **Stock Price Dataset**: A collection of 162 univariate time series of daily closing stock prices from Chinaâ€™s A-shares, collected from three institutions. The dataset includes 2000 series of d-dimensional normalized log-return vectors of length 2570.

Since this dataset is not attributed to a specific publication or repository, I will document it as described without a formal citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will include the dataset name, description, and any relevant details about its usage in the experiments.
