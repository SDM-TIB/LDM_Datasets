To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperPower: Power- and Memory-Constrained Hyper-Parameter Optimization for Neural Networks" by Dimitrios Stamoulis et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the HyperPower framework and its efficiency in hyper-parameter optimization but does not explicitly mention datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** (Section 4), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention using two datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**. The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a server machine with an NVIDIA GTX 1070, while the MNIST dataset is used on both the GTX 1070 and the NVIDIA Tegra TX1.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR-10 dataset is commonly cited as follows:
- For CIFAR-10:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For MNIST:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
   - Citation: Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **MNIST**: A dataset of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), commonly used for training various image processing systems.
   - Citation: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

With this information, I am ready to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
