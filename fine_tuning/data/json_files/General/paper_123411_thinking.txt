To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Low-Resolution Face Recognition with Feature Similarity Knowledge Distillation" by Sungho Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the use of the **AgeDB-30 benchmark** and mentions improvements in low-resolution face recognition, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss various benchmarks and datasets relevant to their study. Here, they mention the **CASIA dataset** and the **MegaFace benchmark**, which are important for understanding the context of their research.

I will then focus on **section 4.2 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. They mention:

1. **CASIA Dataset**: This dataset contains 0.5 million face images and 10,000 identities, which they used to train their face recognition model. The authors describe how they created high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) paired images from this dataset.

2. **AgeDB-30**: This dataset consists of 16,516 images with 570 subjects, used for the 1:1 verification task. The authors state that they evaluated their method on this dataset.

3. **TinyFace Dataset**: This dataset includes 169,403 low-resolution face images with 5,139 subjects, used for the 1:N identification task. The authors note that TinyFace is a well-known benchmark for low-resolution face recognition.

4. **SVHN Dataset**: This dataset contains character-level digit images obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images, with 73,257 training images and 26,032 evaluation images. The authors mention using this dataset for digit classification tasks.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

- For **AgeDB-30**, the citation is:
  > Stylianos Moschoglou, Athanasios Papaioannou, Christos Sagonas, Jiankang Deng, Irene Kotsia, and Stefanos Zafeiriou. *AgeDB: The First Manually Collected, In-the-Wild Age Database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1997â€“2005, 2017.

- For **CASIA**, the citation is:
  > Yi, D., Lei, Z., Liao, S., & Li, S. Z. *Learning Face Representation from Scratch*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1411.7923, 2014.

- For **TinyFace**, the citation is:
  > Zhiyi Cheng, Xiatian Zhu, and S. Gong. *Low-resolution face recognition*. In ACCV, 2018.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. NIPS, 2011.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
