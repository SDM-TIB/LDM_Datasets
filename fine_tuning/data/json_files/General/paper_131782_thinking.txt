To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Model Pruning and Personalization for Federated Learning over Wireless Networks" by Xiaonan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used in the experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors may describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. I will pay close attention to any specific names or descriptions of datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, if the authors mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments, I will look for the citation that typically includes:
- The authors of the dataset
- The title of the dataset or the paper describing it
- The conference or journal where it was published
- The year of publication

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will organize this information in a clear and structured manner, ready for presentation or further processing, ensuring that all citations are accurate and complete.
