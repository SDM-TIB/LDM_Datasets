To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Relative Molecule Self-Attention Transformer" by Łukasz Maziarka et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the importance of molecular property prediction and hints at the use of datasets for training and evaluation. This suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), as this is typically where datasets are explicitly listed. In this section, the authors compare their model (R-MAT) against several benchmarks and mention specific datasets used for evaluation.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention the following datasets:

1. **BBBP Dataset**: This dataset is used for classifying whether a molecule is active against a biological target. The authors note that it uses scaffold splits for evaluation.

2. **ESOL Dataset**: This dataset is used for predicting the solubility of a molecule in water, which is a key property in drug discovery. The authors also mention that the error is measured using RMSE.

3. **FreeSolv Dataset**: Similar to ESOL, this dataset is used for solubility prediction, and the authors indicate that it also employs scaffold splits.

4. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in section 4.3, where the authors evaluate their model on quantum property prediction tasks. It consists of around 130k small molecules with various properties.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **BBBP Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. W. Romero, J.-B. Cordonnier, et al. *Benchmarking molecular property prediction models*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning, 2020.

- For the **ESOL Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lipinski, C. A., et al. *Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in drug discovery and development settings*. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1997.

- For the **FreeSolv Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lipinski, C. A., et al. *Experimental and computational approaches to estimate solubility and permeability in drug discovery and development settings*. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 1997.

- For the **QM9 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. Ramakrishnan, P. O. Dral, M. Rupp, and O. A. von Lilienfeld. *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
