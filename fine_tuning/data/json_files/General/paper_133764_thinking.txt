To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parking spot classification based on surround view camera system" by Andy Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, but I will need to delve deeper into the sections that discuss the methodology and experiments for specific dataset details.

In **section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors describe their dataset, which is crucial for understanding the scope of their research. They mention that they have established a comprehensive benchmark dataset of surround view images, which includes three distinct categories of parking spots: Regular, Handicap, and Electric-Vehicle (EV). The dataset consists of 1352 generated bird’s eye view images with a total of 11,505 labels distributed across these categories.

Next, I will look for any references to existing datasets or benchmarks that may have been used or compared against in their research. However, in this paper, it appears that the authors have created their own dataset specifically for their experiments, rather than utilizing pre-existing datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find any citations that may relate to the dataset they created or any foundational work that informed their dataset design. However, since the dataset is original and not derived from previously published datasets, I will focus on the details provided in the paper itself.

The authors do not provide a formal citation for their dataset since it is newly established. Instead, I will summarize the dataset's characteristics as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Surround View Parking Slot Dataset
   - **Description**: A benchmark dataset of surround view images collected from various indoor and outdoor parking sites, representing diverse real-world scenarios. It includes three categories of parking spots: Regular, Handicap, and Electric-Vehicle (EV).
   - **Image Resolution**: Original fisheye images are 1920 × 1080; synthesized bird's eye view images are 1024 × 1024.
   - **Total Images**: 1352 generated bird’s eye view images.
   - **Total Labels**: 11,505 labels across three categories.

Since the dataset is original and created by the authors, I will note that the citation for this dataset is effectively the paper itself, as it is the primary source of information regarding the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Andy Xiao, Deep Doshi, Lihao Wang, Harsha Gorantla, Thomas Heitzman, and Peter Groth. *Parking spot classification based on surround view camera system*. 

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to present the dataset details in a clear and organized manner, ready for any further processing or review.
