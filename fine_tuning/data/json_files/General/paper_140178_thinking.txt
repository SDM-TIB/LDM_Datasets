To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An In-depth Evaluation of GPT-4 in Sentence Simplification with Error-based Human Assessment" by Xuanxin Wu and Yuki Arase, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study evaluates GPT-4's performance on three representative datasets for sentence simplification, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention both training and evaluation datasets, which is crucial for understanding the context of their experiments.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **WikiLarge**: This dataset consists of 296,000 complex-simple sentence pairs automatically extracted from English Wikipedia and Simple English Wikipedia. It is used for training purposes.

2. **Newsela**: This dataset originates from a collection of news articles with simplified versions written by professional editors. The authors utilized approximately 94,000 complex-simple sentence pairs from this dataset for training.

3. **Turk**: This dataset comprises 2,359 sentences from English Wikipedia, each paired with eight simplified references written by crowd-workers. It focuses on lexical paraphrasing.

4. **ASSET**: This dataset uses the same 2,359 source sentences as the Turk dataset but aims for more diverse transformations, providing 10 simplified references written by crowd-workers.

5. **Newsela (validation and test splits)**: The authors also used the validation and test splits from the Newsela dataset, totaling 2,206 sentence pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **WikiLarge**, the citation is:

- For **Newsela**, the citation is:

- For **Turk**, the citation is:
  > Alva-Manchego, F., Martin, L., Bordes, A., Scarton, C., Sagot, B., & Specia, L. (2020). ASSET: A Dataset for Tuning and Evaluation of Sentence Simplification Models with Multiple Rewriting Transformations. *Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics*. https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.424

- For **ASSET**, the citation is the same as for Turk since they share the same source sentences.

Now that I have gathered the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
