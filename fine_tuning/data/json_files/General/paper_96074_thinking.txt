To extract datasets from the research paper titled "UFPR-Periocular: A Periocular Dataset Collected by Mobile Devices in Unconstrained Scenarios" by Luiz A. Zanlorensi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are introduced or referenced. The abstract mentions the creation of a new periocular dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors describe the UFPR-Periocular dataset in detail in **Section III (Dataset)**. Here, they provide comprehensive information about the dataset, including the number of subjects, images, sessions, and the conditions under which the images were collected.

The key details about the UFPR-Periocular dataset are as follows:
- It contains images from **1,122 subjects**.
- A total of **33,660 images** were collected.
- The images were captured in **3 sessions** using **196 different mobile devices**.
- The dataset is publicly available for research purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the UFPR-Periocular dataset. Since the dataset is introduced in this paper, the citation will be the same as the paper itself. The full citation for the dataset is:
> Luiz A. Zanlorensi, Rayson Laroca, Diego R. Lucio, Lucas R. Santos, Alceu S. Britto Jr., and David Menotti. *UFPR-Periocular: A Periocular Dataset Collected by Mobile Devices in Unconstrained Scenarios*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS), 2022.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly used for comparison or evaluation, I will conclude that the UFPR-Periocular dataset is the primary dataset discussed.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UFPR-Periocular dataset as required. This will allow for easy reference and further analysis.
