To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Skin cancer diagnosis using NIR spectroscopy data of skin lesions in vivo using machine learning algorithms" by Flavio P. Lossa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the creation of a new dataset named **NIR-SC-UFES**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Data and Preprocessing)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the **NIR-SC-UFES Dataset**. This section describes the dataset's purpose, the types of skin lesions included, and the number of samples collected. The dataset consists of spectral data from skin lesions, categorized into cancerous and non-cancerous types, with specific counts for each lesion type.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset, the **PAD-UFES-20 dataset**, which is referenced in the context of images and metadata related to skin lesions. This dataset is also important as it complements the spectral data.

Now, I will gather the full citations for both datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **NIR-SC-UFES Dataset**: The authors indicate that this dataset is newly created and will be published as Data in Brief, so I will note that it is forthcoming and not yet available in a formal citation format.

2. **PAD-UFES-20 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Pacheco, A.G., Lima, R.G., Salom√£o, A.S., Krohling, B., Biral, I.P., de Angelo, G.G., Alves Jr, F.C., Esgario, J.G., Simora, C.A., Castro, P.B., et al. *PAD-UFES-20: a skin lesion dataset composed of patient data and clinical images collected from smartphones*. Data in Brief, 32, 106221, 2020.

With this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **NIR-SC-UFES Dataset**: A newly created dataset for skin lesions using NIR spectroscopy, containing 971 samples categorized into cancerous and non-cancerous lesions. The dataset is expected to be published soon.

- **PAD-UFES-20 Dataset**: A dataset comprising images and metadata of skin lesions, which includes various skin conditions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the citations are accurately represented.
