To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Bayesian network structure learning via local Markov boundary search" by Ming Gao and Bryon Aragam, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract typically provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any statements regarding the datasets used in the research. This section often outlines the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the study's objectives.

I will then focus on the **methodology** and **experiments sections**. These sections usually contain detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific features relevant to the research. I will look for sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar headings.

Once I identify the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if I find that the authors used a dataset called the **"UCI Machine Learning Repository"**, I would look for the full citation, which might be something like:
> Dua, D. and Graff, C. (2019). *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. University of California, Irvine, School of Information and Computer Sciences.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
