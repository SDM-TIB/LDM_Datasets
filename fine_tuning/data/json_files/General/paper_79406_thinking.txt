To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Sequence-based Sleep Stage Classification using Conditional Neural Fields" by Intan Nurma Yulita et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that two datasets are used: one is a public polysomnographic dataset, and the other is a dataset collected through a collaboration with a hospital. This gives me a clear starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 1.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the datasets in detail. Here, I will find the following information:

1. **St. Vincent’s University Hospital Dataset**: This dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from PhysioNet. It consists of recordings of EEG, EOG, and EMG, and is used to classify five sleep stages: Awake, Stage 1 (S1), Stage 2 (S2), Slow wave sleep (SWS), and Rapid eye movement (REM).

2. **Mitra Keluarga Kemayoran Hospital Dataset**: This dataset was collected from a research collaboration and includes approximately 8 hours of polysomnographic records from five subjects. It also classifies the same five sleep stages as the first dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets, but I can infer the following based on the context:

- For the **St. Vincent’s University Hospital Dataset**, I will cite the original source from PhysioNet:
  > PhysioNet. *UCD Sleep Study Dataset*. Available at: http://physionet.org/pn3/ucddb/.

- For the **Mitra Keluarga Kemayoran Hospital Dataset**, since it is a proprietary dataset from a collaboration, I will note that it is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the necessary details and citations. 

In summary, I will ensure that I have:
1. The names of the datasets.
2. A brief description of each dataset.
3. The full citation for the publicly available dataset and a note for the proprietary dataset.

This structured approach will help me accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
