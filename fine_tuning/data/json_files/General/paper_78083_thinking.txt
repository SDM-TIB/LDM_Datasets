To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Soft Correspondences in Multimodal Scene Parsing" by Sarah Taghavi Namin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their approach on **two publicly available datasets containing 2D and 3D data**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors mention using the **DATA61/2D3D dataset** and the **CMU/VMR dataset** for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any relevant statistics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the DATA61/2D3D dataset as containing 12 outdoor scenes with 3D point cloud data and panoramic images, and the CMU/VMR dataset as comprising 372 pairs of urban images and corresponding 3D point cloud data. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' contexts and applications.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets. 

For the **DATA61/2D3D dataset**, the citation is:
> S. T. Namin, M. Najaﬁ, M. Salzmann, and L. Petersson. *A multi-modal graphical model for scene analysis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2015.

For the **CMU/VMR dataset**, the citation is:
> D. Munoz, J. A. Bagnell, and M. Hebert. *Co-inference for multi-modal scene analysis*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

With these citations, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
