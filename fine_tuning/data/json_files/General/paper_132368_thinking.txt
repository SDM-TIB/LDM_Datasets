To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "HAVE-Net: Hallucinated Audio-Visual Embeddings for Few-Shot Classification with Unimodal Cues" by Ankit Jha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **AudioSetZSL**: This dataset is described as a subset of Audio Set that contains weakly annotated visuals related to different audio events. The authors specify the number of base and novel classes used in their experiments.

2. **ADVANCE**: This dataset consists of pairs of remote sensing audio and visual modalities, which are also split into base and novel classes for the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For **AudioSetZSL**, the citation is:
> Gemmeke, J.F., Ellis, D.P.W., Freedman, D., Jansen, A., Lawrence, W., Moore, R.C., Plakal, M., Ritter, M. *Audio set: An ontology and human-labeled dataset for audio events*. In: Proc. IEEE ICASSP 2017. New Orleans, LA (2017).

For **ADVANCE**, the citation is:
> Hu, D., Li, X., Mou, L., Jin, P., Chen, D., Jing, L., Zhu, X., Dou, D. *Cross-task transfer for geotagged audiovisual aerial scene recognition*. (2020).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation.

This process ensures that I have accurately extracted the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future reference.
