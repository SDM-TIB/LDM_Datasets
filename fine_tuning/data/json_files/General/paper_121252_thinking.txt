To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Infusing Commonsense World Models with Graph Knowledge" by Alexander Gurung et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets that might be referenced. The abstract mentions the construction of a "large set of tasks" and a "novel dataset of complex actions," which indicates that there are specific datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and dataset construction sections**. In section 3.2, the authors describe the creation of the USEEVENTS dataset, which is explicitly mentioned as containing multi-object actions and their corresponding narrations. This section provides detailed information about the dataset's purpose and structure.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **experiments sections**. The authors reference the LIGHT game engine (Urbanek et al., 2019) as a foundational dataset for their work, which is crucial to note.

In the **dataset statistics section**, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the tasks and datasets used, including the USEEVENTS dataset. This section will help me gather specific details about the dataset's size and characteristics.

Now, I will compile the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **USEEVENTS Dataset**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 10,000 fully defined UseEvents, which include complex actions and their narrations. However, the paper does not provide a formal citation for this dataset since it is newly created.

2. **LIGHT Dataset**: The citation for the LIGHT dataset is:
   > Urbanek, J., Fan, A., Karamcheti, S., Jain, S., Humeau, S., Dinan, E., Rocktäschel, T., Kiela, D., Szlam, A., & Weston, J. (2019). Learning to Speak and Act in a Fantasy Text Adventure Game. In Proceedings of the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP-IJCNLP), pages 673–683, Hong Kong, China. Association for Computational Linguistics.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I accurately document the datasets and their citations in the required format for further processing or review. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured effectively.
