To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BT-Adapter: Video Conversation is Feasible Without Video Instruction Tuning" by Ruyang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Datasets)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets utilized in the study. Here, I will look for specific names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics or characteristics of each dataset.

In section 6, the authors mention several datasets:

1. **MSRVTT**: A video-text retrieval benchmark consisting of 10,000 YouTube videos, each with 20 captions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jun Xu, Tao Mei, Ting Yao, and Yong Rui. *MSR-VTT: A Large Video Description Dataset for Bridging Video and Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5288–5296, 2016.

2. **DiDemo**: This dataset includes 10,611 videos from Flickr and 40,000 sentences. The citation is:
   > Lisa Anne Hendricks, Oliver Wang, Eli Shechtman, Josef Sivic, Trevor Darrell, and Bryan Russell. *Localizing Moments in Video with Natural Language*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5803–5812, 2017.

3. **LSMDC**: Comprising 118,081 videos extracted from 202 movies, the citation is:
   > Anna Rohrbach, Atousa Torabi, Marcus Rohrbach, Niket Tandon, Christopher Pal, Hugo Larochelle, Aaron Courville, and Bernt Schiele. *Movie Description*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 123(1):94–120, 2017.

4. **ActivityNet**: This dataset contains 20,000 YouTube videos. The citation is:
   > Fabian Caba Heilbron, Victor Escorcia, Bernard Ghanem, and Juan Carlos Niebles. *ActivityNet: A Large-Scale Video Benchmark for Human Activity Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 961–970, 2015.

5. **WebVid2M**: Used for pretraining, this dataset consists of approximately 2.5 million video-caption pairs. The citation is:
   > Max Bain, Arsha Nagrani, Gül Varol, and Andrew Zisserman. *Frozen in Time: A Joint Video and Image Encoder for End-to-End Retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1728–1738, 2021.

6. **VideoChatGPT**: This benchmark is designed for evaluating video conversation models, containing 100k video-text instruction pairs. The citation is:
   > Muhammad Maaz, Hanoona Rasheed, Salman Khan, and Fahad Shahbaz Khan. *Video-ChatGPT: Towards Detailed Video Understanding via Large Vision and Language Models*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.05424, 2023.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have captured all relevant details, including the context in which each dataset was used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for further processing or review.
