To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised 3D Semantic Representation Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation" by Sinan Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the **R2R dataset**, indicating that it is a key dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will delve into **section 4 (Experiment and Results)**, where the authors discuss their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly state that they used the **R2R dataset** for training their navigation model. This section will provide details about how the dataset was utilized and any specific splits or variations mentioned.

In the **experiment setup**, the authors describe their training process, which includes using the **Speaker-Follower augmented data** provided by PREVALENT, which is also relevant to the dataset context. However, the primary dataset for evaluation remains the **R2R dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the R2R dataset. The citation for the R2R dataset is as follows:
> Anderson, P., Wu, Q., Teney, D., Bruce, J., Johnson, M., Sunderhauf, N., Reid, I., Gould, S., & Van Den Hengel, A. (2018). Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3674â€“3683.

Since the R2R dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information regarding this dataset, including its citation, into a structured format for further processing.

After gathering all necessary details, I will ensure that the dataset entry is complete and accurately reflects the information provided in the paper.
