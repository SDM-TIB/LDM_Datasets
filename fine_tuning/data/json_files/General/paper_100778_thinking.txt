To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep-Learning Discovers Macroscopic Governing Equations for Viscous Gravity Currents from Microscopic Simulation Data" by Junsheng Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or simulation data.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of deep learning to discover governing equations based on simulation data. They mention that the training data for their deep-learning framework comes from "high-resolution microscopic simulation data." This indicates that the dataset is derived from simulations rather than experimental data.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where they describe the preparation of training data. They mention that the training data for the viscous gravity current process is extracted from "refined numerical simulation," which suggests that the dataset is based on computational simulations rather than real-world measurements.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the deep-learning framework and compare their results with theoretical predictions. They refer to "microscopic simulation data" multiple times, which reinforces the idea that the dataset is derived from simulations.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets used. However, since the authors primarily rely on their own simulations, there may not be external datasets to cite. Instead, I will note that the dataset is based on their own numerical simulations.

Based on this analysis, I will summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Microscopic Simulation Data for Viscous Gravity Currents
   - **Description**: This dataset consists of high-resolution simulation data used to train a deep-learning framework for discovering macroscopic governing equations of viscous gravity currents. The data includes spatio-temporal points of current front height, derived from refined numerical simulations of viscous gravity currents in a two-dimensional vertical fracture.
   - **Citation**: Zeng, J., Xu, H., Chen, Y., & Zhang, D. (2023). Deep-Learning Discovers Macroscopic Governing Equations for Viscous Gravity Currents from Microscopic Simulation Data. *Journal of Computational Physics*, 455, 110592. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2023.110592

After compiling this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
