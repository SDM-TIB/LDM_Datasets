To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Visual Identification of Individual Holstein-Friesian Cattle via Deep Metric Learning" by William Andrew et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors present a method for automated detection and identification of individual Holstein-Friesian cattle, which suggests that there may be datasets involved in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset: OpenCows2020)**, where the authors explicitly describe the dataset they introduced for their experiments. This section is crucial as it provides detailed information about the dataset's composition and purpose.

In **subsection 3.1 (Detection and Localisation)**, the authors describe the first component of the OpenCows2020 dataset, which consists of 3,707 images with 6,917 cattle annotations. They mention that these images were manually annotated to include bounding boxes around the cattle, adhering to specific guidelines.

In **subsection 3.2 (Identification)**, the authors detail the second component of the dataset, which focuses on identifying individual cattle. They explain that individuals with fewer than 20 instances were discarded, resulting in a population of 46 individuals with an average of 103 instances per class.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the OpenCows2020 dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset and its associated code, which is essential for proper citation.

The citation for the OpenCows2020 dataset is:
> Andrew, W., Gao, J., Mullan, S., Campbell, N., Dowsey, A. W., & Burghardt, T. (2020). *OpenCows2020 dataset*. Available at: https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.10m32xl88x2b61zlkkgz3fml17.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and citation, into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary information regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
