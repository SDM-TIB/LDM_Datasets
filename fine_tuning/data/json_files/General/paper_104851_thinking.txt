To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A novel framework based on deep learning and ANOVA feature selection method for diagnosis of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray Images" by Hamid Nasiri and Seyyed Ali Alavi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the **ChestX-ray8 dataset** was used for training and evaluation, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will check the **Materials and Methods section** for more details about the dataset. In this section, the authors confirm that the **ChestX-ray8 dataset** was employed, which is a publicly available dataset. They mention that it includes images for COVID-19, No-findings, and Pneumonia classes, providing a clear context for its use.

I will also look into the **Results section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or referenced. The authors state that they used the dataset collected by Ozturk et al. for their experiments, which includes 125 COVID-19 cases, 500 No-findings, and 500 Pneumonia images. This is important for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **ChestX-ray8 Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 2097â€“2106.

2. **Ozturk et al. Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Ozturk, T., Talo, M., Yildirim, E. A., Baloglu, U. B., Yildirim, O., & Acharya, U. R. (2020). *Automated detection of COVID-19 cases using deep neural networks with X-ray images*. Comput. Biol. Med., 121, 103792. doi:10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103792.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
