To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Large Language Models to Generate Answer Set Programs" by Adam Ishay et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for testing their methods. In this section, the authors mention that they tested their pipeline on the **logic puzzles dataset from Mitra and Baral (2015)**. This is a clear indication that a specific dataset is being utilized.

I will then look for any additional datasets mentioned throughout the paper, especially in the **related work** or **methodology sections**, where the authors might reference other datasets used in prior studies or comparisons.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. For the dataset mentioned, I will ensure to retrieve the complete citation as follows:

- For the **logic puzzles dataset from Mitra and Baral (2015)**, the citation is:
  > Mitra, A., and Baral, C. (2015). *Learning to automatically solve logic grid puzzles*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 1023â€“1033.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while adhering to the importance of providing complete citations.
