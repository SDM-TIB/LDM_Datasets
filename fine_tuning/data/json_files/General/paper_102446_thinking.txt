To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Detection for Efficient Video Analytics at the Edge" by Yanzhao Wu, Ling Liu, and Ramana Kompella, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed approach using benchmark videos, which indicates that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using two benchmark videos from the MOT-15 challenge dataset: **ADL-Rundle-6** and **ETH-Sunnyday**. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of frames, frame rates, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

For **ADL-Rundle-6**, the paper states:
- It is shot from a static camera at 30 FPS and has a total of 525 frames with a resolution of 1920×1080.

For **ETH-Sunnyday**, the details are:
- It is taken from a moving camera at 14 FPS with a total of 354 frames and a resolution of 640×480.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the MOT-15 challenge dataset, which is the source for both videos. The citation for the MOT-15 dataset is:
> Leal-Taixé, L., Milan, A., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2015). *MOTChallenge 2015: Towards a benchmark for multi-target tracking*. arXiv:1504.01942.

I will compile the extracted datasets with their descriptions and citations. The datasets are:
1. **ADL-Rundle-6**: A video shot from a static camera at 30 FPS, 525 frames, resolution 1920×1080.
   - Citation: Leal-Taixé, L., Milan, A., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2015). *MOTChallenge 2015: Towards a benchmark for multi-target tracking*. arXiv:1504.01942.

2. **ETH-Sunnyday**: A video taken from a moving camera at 14 FPS, 354 frames, resolution 640×480.
   - Citation: Leal-Taixé, L., Milan, A., Reid, I., Roth, S., & Schindler, K. (2015). *MOTChallenge 2015: Towards a benchmark for multi-target tracking*. arXiv:1504.01942.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant information and citations before preparing the final output for review or further processing.
