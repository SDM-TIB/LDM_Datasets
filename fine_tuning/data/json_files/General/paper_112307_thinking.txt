To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neuromorphic Wireless Cognition: Event-Driven Semantic Communications for Remote Inference" by Jiechen Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides an overview of the proposed system but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to delve deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section VI), as this is where datasets are typically discussed in detail. In this section, the authors mention the **MNIST-DVS dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its structure and the context in which it is used.

The authors describe the **MNIST-DVS dataset** as containing labeled 26 Ã— 26 spiking signals of duration L = 80 samples, with 900 examples from each class for training and 100 examples for testing. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their proposed system in classifying handwritten digits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MNIST-DVS dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> T. Serrano-Gotarredona and B. Linares-Barranco. *Poker-DVS and MNIST-DVS: their history, how they were made, and other details*. Frontiers in neuroscience, vol. 9, p. 481, 2015.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset extraction:

1. **MNIST-DVS Dataset**: This dataset consists of labeled spiking signals of handwritten digits, specifically designed for neuromorphic computing applications. It includes 900 training examples and 100 testing examples for each class.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or processing.
