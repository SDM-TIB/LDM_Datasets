To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MM-ViT: Multi-Modal Video Transformer for Compressed Video Action Recognition" by Jiawei Chen and Chiu Man Ho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on three public action recognition benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they evaluated their method on three popular video action recognition datasets:

1. **UCF-101**: This dataset contains 13,320 trimmed short videos from 101 action categories. The authors note that it has three training-testing splits and report average performance across these splits.

2. **Something-Something-v2 (SSv2)**: This dataset consists of about 220,000 videos with a time span from 2 to 6 seconds for 174 action classes. The authors highlight that SSv2 emphasizes fine-grained action recognition.

3. **Kinetics-600**: This dataset contains around 480,000 10-second long videos for 600 action classes. It is noted for its large scale and diversity.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **UCF-101**, the citation is:
  > Khurram Soomro, Amir Roshan Zamir, and Mubarak Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

- For **Something-Something-v2**, the citation is:
  > Raghav Goyal, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Vincent Michalski, Joanna Materzynska, Susanne Westphal, Heuna Kim, Valentin Haenel, Ingo Freund, Peter Yianilos, Moritz Mueller-Freitag, et al. *The “something something” video database for learning and evaluating visual common sense*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5842–5850, 2017.

- For **Kinetics-600**, the citation is:
  > Will Kay, Joao Carreira, Karen Simonyan, Brian Zhang, Chloe Hillier, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Fabio Viola, Tim Green, Trevor Back, Paul Natsev, et al. *The kinetics human action video dataset*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.06950, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
