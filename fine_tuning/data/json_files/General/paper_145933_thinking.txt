To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What type of inference is planning?" by Miguel LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a concise overview, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets used for validation or comparison. I will take note of any dataset names or descriptions provided.

Then, I will examine the **methods** and **experiments** sections in detail. These sections typically contain the most information about the datasets used in the study, including their characteristics, sizes, and how they were utilized in the experiments. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For this paper, I anticipate finding the following datasets based on the context of the research:

1. **Synthetic MDPs**: The authors mention generating synthetic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) for empirical validation. I will look for details on how these datasets were created and any specific parameters used.

2. **International Planning Competition Datasets**: The paper references tasks from the International Planning Competition (IPPC). I will need to find the specific datasets used in their experiments and their corresponding citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section of the paper.

Finally, I will format this information clearly and concisely for easy understanding and future reference.
