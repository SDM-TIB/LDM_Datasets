To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StawGAN: Structural-Aware Generative Adversarial Networks for Infrared Image Translation" by Luigi Sigillo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their model on the **DroneVehicle dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experimental evaluation section (III)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used. In this section, they describe the **DroneVehicle dataset** as containing 56,878 samples taken by drones, with half being RGB images and half being infrared images. They also mention that the dataset includes annotations with oriented bounding boxes for five different categories of vehicles.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the **DroneVehicle dataset**. The authors reference the dataset in the context of their experiments, and I need to ensure I capture the correct citation format.

The citation for the **DroneVehicle dataset** is:
> Yiming Sun, Bing Cao, Pengfei Zhu, and Qinghua Hu. "Drone-based RGB-infrared cross-modality vehicle detection via uncertainty-aware learning." IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, pp. 1â€“1, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose, the number of samples, and the types of images included. I will ensure that the full citation is included for proper attribution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately represented.
