To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Semi-Supervised Semantics Understanding from Speech" by Cheng-I Lai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their framework on two public SLU corpora, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental setup section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using the **ATIS** and **SNIPS** datasets. I will take note of the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and any modifications made for the experiments.

1. **ATIS Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing 8 hours of audio recordings of people making flight reservations, with a total of 5.2k utterances from over 600 speakers. This dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of spoken language understanding.

2. **SNIPS Dataset**: The authors mention that this dataset consists of 10.5 hours of audio. However, since the original training audio data was not released, they synthesized audio from text data using a commercial TTS service, which they refer to as **SNIPS-Multi**. This dataset is also widely used for evaluating SLU systems.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ATIS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hemphill, C. T., Godfrey, J. J., & Doddington, G. R. (1990). *The ATIS spoken language systems pilot corpus*. In Speech and Natural Language: Proceedings of a Workshop Held at Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania, June 24-27, 1990.

- For the **SNIPS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Coucke, A., Saade, A., Ball, A., Bluche, T., Caulier, A., Leroy, D., Doumouro, C., Gisselbrecht, T., Caltagirone, F., Lavril, T., et al. (2018). *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
