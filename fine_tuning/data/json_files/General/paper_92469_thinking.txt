To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Certifying clusters from sum-of-norms clustering" by Tao Jiang and Stephen Vavasis, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their characteristics, sizes, and any preprocessing steps taken.

In this paper, I will look for mentions of datasets such as "Gaussian mixture data" and "half-moon data" in the context of the numerical experiments. The authors may provide specific details about these datasets, including how they were generated or sourced.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will look for any papers or sources cited that describe the datasets in detail.

For example, if the authors mention using a "Gaussian mixture dataset," I will search for the original source of this dataset in the references. If they refer to a specific dataset like "Penn Action Dataset" or "sub-JHMDB Dataset," I will ensure to find the corresponding citations for these datasets as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing, ensuring that all citations are complete and correctly formatted.
