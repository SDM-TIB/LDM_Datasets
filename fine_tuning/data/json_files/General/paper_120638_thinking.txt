To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Electromagnetic Based Communication Model for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas" by Robin Jess Williams et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for validation or testing. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to specific datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will explicitly state the datasets they used in a separate section, often titled "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section, I will check the **results and discussion sections**. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings, so I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant metrics or results derived from them.

Once I identify the datasets, I will need to gather the full citations for each dataset. This information is usually found in the **references section** of the paper. I will look for the original papers or sources that describe the datasets in detail, as these citations are crucial for proper attribution.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will search for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

After compiling the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will ensure that I format the information clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or presentation.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or experiments.
3. Check the results and discussion sections for additional references to datasets.
4. Gather full citations from the references section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile and format the dataset information for clarity and accuracy.
