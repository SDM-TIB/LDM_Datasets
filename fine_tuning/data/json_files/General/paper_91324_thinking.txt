To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Novel Weighted Combination Method for Feature Selection using Fuzzy Sets" by Zixiao Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method was evaluated on **three publicly available biomedical datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention three datasets:

1. **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIMA)**: This dataset is used to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The citation for this dataset is:
   > J. W. Smith, J. Everhart, W. Dickson, W. Knowler, and R. Johannes. "Using the adap learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus." In Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, American Medical Informatics Association, 1988, p. 261.

2. **Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC)**: This dataset was generated from clinical cases to predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant based on visually assessed features. The citation for this dataset is:
   > W. H. Wolberg and O. L. Mangasarian. "Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast cytology." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 87, no. 23, pp. 9193â€“9196, 1990.

3. **Parkinsons Dataset**: This dataset consists of biomedical voice measurements used to discriminate between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's disease. The citation for this dataset is:
   > M. A. Little, P. E. McSharry, S. J. Roberts, D. A. Costello, and I. M. Moroz. "Exploiting nonlinear recurrence and fractal scaling properties for voice disorder detection." Biomedical Engineering Online, vol. 6, no. 1, p. 23, 2007.

After identifying the datasets and their descriptions, I will ensure that I have the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and citations, ready for further processing or review.
