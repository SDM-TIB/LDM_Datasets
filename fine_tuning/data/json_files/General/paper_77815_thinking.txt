To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Inner-loop Free Solution to Inverse Problems using Deep Neural Networks" by Qi Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses experiments on both synthetic data and real datasets, which indicates that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **Section 4.1 (Synthetic Data)**, the authors mention generating observed data as \( y = Ax + n \), where \( x \) is drawn from a Laplace distribution. However, they do not specify a dataset name here, as it seems to be a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

In **Section 4.2 (Image Super-resolution and Motion Deblurring)**, the authors explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** and the **CUB-200-2011 dataset** for their experiments. This is a crucial point as it provides the names of real datasets used in their work.

In **Section 4.3 (Joint Super-resolution and Colorization)**, they refer to the **CelebA dataset** for testing their method on automatic colorization. This is another important dataset that needs to be documented.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of the datasets mentioned:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition*. Proc. IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

2. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**:
   > Catherine Wah, Steve Branson, Peter Welinder, Pietro Perona, and Serge Belongie. *The Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 dataset*. 2011.

3. **CelebA Dataset**:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Comp. Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
