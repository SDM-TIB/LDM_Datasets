To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inference at the dataâ€™s edge: Gaussian processes for modeling and inference under model-dependency, poor overlap, and extrapolation" by Soonhong Cho, Doeun Kim, and Chad Hazlett, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on Gaussian Processes (GPs) and their application in social science inference, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges of model dependency and extrapolation but does not specify any datasets used in the research.

I will then look into the **methodology and results sections** to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their experiments or analyses. In this paper, the authors apply GPs to various settings, including comparisons with poor covariate overlap, interrupted time-series designs, and regression discontinuity. They mention using simulated data for their analyses, but I need to confirm if they reference any specific datasets.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors conducted simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of GPs. They describe the simulation settings in detail, including the generation of random functions and the use of specific parameters, but they do not cite any external datasets.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited there. The references primarily consist of papers that discuss methodologies and applications relevant to the study but do not provide specific datasets.

After thoroughly reviewing the paper, it appears that the authors primarily used simulated data for their analyses and did not reference any publicly available datasets. Therefore, I will note that no external datasets were extracted from this paper.

In summary, I will compile my findings, noting that while the paper discusses various applications of GPs, it does not provide specific datasets or citations for external datasets. This will be important for documenting the sources and ensuring clarity in the research context.
