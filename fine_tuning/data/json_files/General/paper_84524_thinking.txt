To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Probabilistic Hypergraph Grammars for Efficient Molecular Optimization" by Egor Kraev and Mark Harley, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions inferring a hypergraph replacement grammar from the **ChEMBL database**, which indicates that this database is a key dataset used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the need for a training dataset and refer to the **ChEMBL training set of 1,273,104 SMILES strings**. This is a significant dataset that will need to be documented.

In the **methodology section**, I will check for any additional datasets that might be referenced, particularly in the context of training or evaluation. The authors mention using the **GuacaMol benchmarks** for evaluating their model, which suggests that this is another dataset of interest.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **ChEMBL database**, the citation is:
   > P. Pogány, N. Arad, S. Genway, and S. D. Pickett. *De novo molecule design by translating from reduced graphs to smiles*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, vol. 59, no. 3, pp. 1136–1146, 2019.

2. For the **GuacaMol benchmarks**, the citation is:
   > N. Brown, M. Fiscato, M. H. Segler, and A. C. Vaucher. *Guacamol: Benchmarking models for de novo molecular design*. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, vol. 59, no. 3, pp. 1096–1108, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
