To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Demystifying Softmax Gating Function in Gaussian Mixture of Experts" by Huy Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are mentioned or referenced. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used in the experiments, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** of the paper, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and how they were utilized in the experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will take note of their characteristics, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any relevant metrics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper includes any supplementary materials or appendices, I will review those as well, as they may contain additional information about the datasets used in the research.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the details into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset, formatted correctly.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, providing a comprehensive overview that adheres to academic standards.
