To extract datasets from the research paper titled "End-to-End Rate-Distortion Optimized 3D Gaussian Representation" by Henan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors verify their method on multiple benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is typically where datasets are detailed. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Mip-NeRF360 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a benchmark for novel view synthesis and is known for its diverse scenes.
2. **Tanks and Temples Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for evaluating 3D reconstruction methods and includes various real-world scenes.
3. **Deep Blending Dataset**: This dataset is used for image-based rendering tasks and is mentioned as one of the datasets for their experiments.
4. **NeRF-Synthetic Dataset**: This dataset consists of synthetic scenes designed for neural radiance fields and is also used in their evaluations.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are as follows:

- For **Mip-NeRF360 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barron, J.T., Mildenhall, B., Verbin, D., Srinivasan, P.P., Hedman, P. *Mip-nerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5470–5479, 2022.

- For **Tanks and Temples Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Knapitsch, A., Park, J., Zhou, Q.Y., Koltun, V. *Tanks and temples: Benchmarking large-scale scene reconstruction*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 36(4), 1–13, 2017.

- For **Deep Blending Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Hedman, P., Philip, J., Price, T., Frahm, J.M., Drettakis, G., Brostow, G. *Deep blending for free-viewpoint image-based rendering*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (ToG), 37(6), 1–15, 2018.

- For **NeRF-Synthetic Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mildenhall, B., Srinivasan, P.P., Tancik, M., Barron, J.T., Ramamoorthi, R., Ng, R. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. Communications of the ACM, 65(1), 99–106, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
