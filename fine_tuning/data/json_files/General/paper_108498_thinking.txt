To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Multi-Access Edge Computing Schedule for Internet of Vehicles" by Xiaoyu Dai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used for simulations or experiments. In this case, the abstract discusses a Multi-Agent Graph Convolutional Deep Reinforcement Learning (M-AGCDRL) algorithm but does not specify any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** or **system model** sections, as these often detail the experimental setup and may include specific datasets used for simulations. In this paper, the authors mention using the SUMO simulation tool to generate vehicle trace data, which indicates that a dataset is involved, but I need to find more details.

I will then check the **simulation results** section, where the authors describe the simulation scenarios. They mention two scenarios: a synthetic traffic grid and a real-world traffic network from Sapporo city. This suggests that there are datasets related to vehicle traces generated from these scenarios.

To ensure I have the correct dataset names and details, I will look for any references to specific datasets or data sources in the **references section**. The authors cite the SUMO tool, which is a well-known traffic simulation software, but they do not provide a specific dataset citation for the vehicle traces generated.

After reviewing the paper, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets:

1. **Vehicle Trace Data from SUMO**: This dataset is generated using the SUMO simulation tool, which creates realistic vehicle movement patterns for the simulations conducted in the paper. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset.

2. **Sapporo City Traffic Data**: The authors mention using a real-world traffic network from Sapporo city, but again, no specific dataset citation is provided.

Since the paper does not provide full citations for the datasets used, I will note that while the SUMO tool is referenced, the specific datasets generated from it and the Sapporo city traffic data lack formal citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, noting the absence of specific citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper.
