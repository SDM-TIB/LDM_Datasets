To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Image Completion and Enhancement using GANs" by Priyansh Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image completion and enhancement, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** where the authors describe their approach to image completion using GANs. In this section, they mention the **CelebA-hq dataset** as the primary dataset used for training and testing their model. The authors detail the preprocessing steps, including splitting the dataset into training and testing images, which confirms its significance in their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **results and discussion** sections. However, the focus remains on the CelebA-hq dataset, and no other datasets are explicitly referenced.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA-hq dataset. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for proper citation. The citation for the CelebA-hq dataset is as follows:

- **CelebA-hq Dataset**: 
  > Liu, Ziwei, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. "Deep learning face attributes in the wild." In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

With this information, I have identified the dataset used in the paper and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
