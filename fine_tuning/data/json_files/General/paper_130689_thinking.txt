To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Performance of Feed-Forward and Convolutional Neural Networks Through Dynamic Activation Functions" by Chinmay Rane et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the introduction and results sections are more likely to contain specific dataset names and descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss various applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and mention the use of datasets like **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** for image recognition tasks. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section**. Here, the authors present tables comparing the performance of their proposed AdAct algorithm across different datasets. They explicitly mention several datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Oh7 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced in the context of approximation tasks.
2. **White Wine Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the evaluation for model performance.
3. **Superconductivity Dataset**: Another dataset used for testing the algorithms.
4. **F24 Dataset**: Included in the comparison of results.
5. **Concrete Dataset**: Also referenced in the performance evaluation.
6. **Weather Dataset**: Mentioned as part of the datasets used in the experiments.
7. **GongTrn Dataset**: Used for classification tasks.
8. **Comf18 Dataset**: Another dataset for classification.
9. **Speechless Dataset**: Included in the classification evaluation.
10. **Cover Dataset**: Mentioned in the context of classification.
11. **Scrap Dataset**: Also referenced for classification tasks.
12. **f17c Dataset**: Included in the classification results.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, publication venues, and years.

For example, I will look for the following citations:

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper.
