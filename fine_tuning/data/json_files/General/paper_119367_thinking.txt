To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Language Modeling" by Michihiro Yasunaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **LAION dataset** for training the model, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that discuss datasets in detail, particularly **section 4 (Experiments)**, where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention that they trained their model using **150M text-image pairs from the LAION dataset**. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their work.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the LAION dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Schuhmann, C., Vencu, R., Beaumont, R., Kaczmarczyk, R., Mullis, C., Katta, A., Coombes, T., Jitsev, J., and Komatsuzaki, A. *Laion-400m: Open dataset of clip-filtered 400 million image-text pairs*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02114, 2021.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information I have gathered:

1. **LAION Dataset**: This dataset consists of 150 million text-image pairs collected from the web, which is used for training the retrieval-augmented multimodal model.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
