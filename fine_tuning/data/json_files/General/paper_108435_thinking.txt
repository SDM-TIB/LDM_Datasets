To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Auxiliary Cross-Modal Representation Learning with Triplet Loss Functions for Online Handwriting Recognition" by Felix Ott et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference specific datasets. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to previous works that utilized datasets.

In the **methodology section**, I will pay close attention to any subsections that discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. The authors typically provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and how they were collected.

In the **results section**, I will look for any performance metrics related to the datasets, as this may confirm their usage in the experiments.

From my reading, I have identified two key datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **OnHW-words500 Dataset**: This dataset contains 25,218 samples contributed by 53 writers, each writing the same 500 words. It is used for online handwriting recognition tasks.

2. **OnHW-wordsRandom Dataset**: This dataset consists of 14,641 randomly selected words from 54 writers, also used for online handwriting recognition tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors may have cited previous works that introduced these datasets, which will provide the necessary citation information.

The full citations I found are:

- For the **OnHW-words500 Dataset**:
  > Ott, F., Rügamer, D., Heublein, L., Bischl, B., & Mutschler, C. (2022). The OnHW Dataset: Online Handwriting Recognition from IMU-Enhanced Ballpoint Pens with Machine Learning. In Proc. of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT), 4(3), article 92.

- For the **OnHW-wordsRandom Dataset**:
  > Ott, F., Rügamer, D., Heublein, L., Bischl, B., & Mutschler, C. (2022). Benchmarking Online Sequence-to-Sequence and Character-based Handwriting Recognition from IMU-Enhanced Pens. International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR), 25(12), 385–414.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
