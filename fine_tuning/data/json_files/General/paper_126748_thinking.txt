To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Raising the Bar for Certified Adversarial Robustness with Diffusion Models" by Thomas Altstidl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Experiment Setup)**, where the authors explicitly state that they performed experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100**. They also mention that these datasets are used for evaluating the effectiveness of their proposed methods. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

In the **Results section**, the authors provide detailed results for their experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, further solidifying their use in the study. They report improvements in certified accuracy on both datasets, which indicates that they are central to the findings of the paper.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Master’s thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, 2009. (CIFAR-100 is derived from CIFAR-10 and often referenced together).

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
