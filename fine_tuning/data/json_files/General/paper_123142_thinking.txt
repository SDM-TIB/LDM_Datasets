To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MuscleMap: Towards Video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation in the Wild" by Kunyu Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors provide the **MuscleMap dataset**, which is a significant indicator that a dataset is being introduced.

Next, I will look for specific details about the **MuscleMap dataset** in the **introduction** and **benchmark sections**. The introduction mentions that the dataset contains over **15,000 video clips** with **135 different activities** and **20 labeled muscle groups**. This provides a good overview of the dataset's scale and purpose.

In the **benchmark section**, the authors elaborate on the dataset, confirming that it is constructed from YouTube videos focusing on **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)** exercises. They also mention that the dataset is annotated with binary activations for different muscle regions, which is crucial for understanding its application in muscle group estimation.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **MuscleMap dataset**. The authors provide a link to the dataset's repository, which is essential for proper citation. The citation for the MuscleMap dataset is as follows:
> Kunyu Peng, David Schneider, Alina Roitberg, Kailun Yang, Jiaming Zhang, Chen Deng, Kaiyu Zhang, M. Saquib Sarfraz, and Rainer Stiefelhagen. *MuscleMap: Towards Video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation in the Wild*. Available at: https://github.com/KPeng9510/MuscleMap.

Since the MuscleMap dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will focus on this dataset for extraction.

Now, I will summarize the details of the **MuscleMap dataset**:
- **Name**: MuscleMap
- **Description**: A video-based dataset containing over 15,000 clips of 135 different activities, annotated with 20 muscle groups, focusing on HIIT exercises.
- **Citation**: Kunyu Peng, David Schneider, Alina Roitberg, Kailun Yang, Jiaming Zhang, Chen Deng, Kaiyu Zhang, M. Saquib Sarfraz, and Rainer Stiefelhagen. *MuscleMap: Towards Video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation in the Wild*. Available at: https://github.com/KPeng9510/MuscleMap.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
