To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tensor Regression Networks with various Low-Rank Tensor Approximations" by Xingwei Cao and Guillaume Rabusseau, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed model on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6), where the authors describe their experimental setup and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention the datasets utilized for their experiments:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as consisting of 28 × 28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples.

2. **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 60,000 training and 5,000 testing images of fashion items, serving as a drop-in replacement for the MNIST dataset.

3. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The authors state that this dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

4. **CIFAR-100 Dataset**: Similar to CIFAR-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 classes, with 500 training images and 100 test images per class.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun. *The database of handwritten digits*. 1998. Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **Fashion-MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **CIFAR-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton. *ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 1097–1105, 2012.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
