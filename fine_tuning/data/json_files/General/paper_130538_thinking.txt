To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Coding with Iterative Block Leverage Score Sampling" by Neophytos Charalambides, Mert Pilanci, and Alfred O. Hero III, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for validation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions of their contents, and any relevant statistics such as the number of samples, features, or any other pertinent details.

In this paper, the authors mention using **artificial datasets with non-uniform induced sampling distributions** for their experiments. I will look for any specific names or references to these datasets in the text. If the datasets are not named directly, I will note the characteristics described, such as the type of data, the number of samples, and the context in which they were used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are referenced. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

If the datasets are original or created by the authors, I will note that as well and provide a description based on the information given in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and characteristics.
3. The full citation for the dataset if available, or a note indicating that it is an original dataset created for the study.

By following these steps, I will ensure a comprehensive extraction of datasets from the paper, maintaining clarity and accuracy in the documentation process.
