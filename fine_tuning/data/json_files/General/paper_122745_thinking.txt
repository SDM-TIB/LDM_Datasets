To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Precoding-oriented Massive MIMO CSI Feedback Design" by Fabrizio Carpi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the use of deep learning for CSI feedback but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **experiments and results sections** to identify any datasets used for simulations or evaluations. In this paper, the authors describe their simulation setup in **Section IV (Simulation Results)**, where they mention using a multipath channel model for their simulations. However, they do not specify a publicly available dataset; instead, they describe the channel model parameters and the simulation conditions.

Since the paper does not reference any specific datasets or publicly available data, I will check the **References section** to see if any cited works include datasets that might be relevant. The references primarily consist of previous research papers discussing various aspects of MIMO systems and CSI feedback, but they do not provide direct links to datasets.

Given that there are no explicit datasets mentioned in the paper, I will summarize my findings as follows:

1. **No specific datasets were identified** in the paper for the experiments or simulations.
2. The authors utilized a multipath channel model for their simulations, but this is not a dataset in the traditional sense.
3. The references do not point to any datasets that could be extracted for use.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will conclude that this paper does not provide any datasets for extraction. If I were to document this, I would note that while the paper discusses methodologies and simulation setups, it does not include any datasets or references to datasets that can be cited.

In summary, I will prepare a message indicating that no datasets were found in the paper and that the authors focused on theoretical and simulation-based approaches without referencing specific datasets.
