To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning to Manipulate Anywhere: A Visual Generalizable Framework For Reinforcement Learning" by Zhecheng Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the framework and its capabilities, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the tasks and datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention developing **8 tasks** based on the MuJoCo engine, which suggests that there may be datasets associated with these tasks.

I will also check the **appendix** for any additional details regarding the tasks and datasets. The appendix often contains supplementary information that can clarify the datasets used in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors do not explicitly name any datasets in the traditional sense (like benchmark datasets). Instead, they describe the tasks and the environments used for training and evaluation. The tasks are designed for robotic manipulation and are based on the MuJoCo physics engine, which implies that the data generated during these tasks is part of the experimental setup.

Since the paper does not provide specific dataset names or citations, I will note that the datasets are generated from the tasks described in the paper. However, I will still need to provide citations for the MuJoCo engine and any relevant references that describe the tasks or methodologies used.

The relevant citations I will include are:

1. For the MuJoCo physics engine:
   > Todorov, E., Erez, T., & Tassa, Y. (2012). MuJoCo: A physics engine for model-based control. In 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) (pp. 5026â€“5033). IEEE. doi:10.1109/IROS.2012.6386109.

2. For the tasks and methodologies, I will reference the relevant sections of the paper itself, as they describe the experimental setup and the tasks in detail.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to compile the dataset entries, even though they are more task-based rather than traditional datasets, into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
