To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cross-Media Keyphrase Prediction: A Unified Framework with Multi-Modality Multi-Head Attention and Image Wordings" by Yue Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a "large-scale dataset newly collected from Twitter," which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Multi-modal Tweet Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they collected. Here, they describe the dataset collection process, the criteria for inclusion, and the statistics of the dataset. 

The dataset is characterized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: Multi-modal Tweet Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 53,701 tweets, each with a distinct text-image pair, collected from Twitter. The tweets include user-generated hashtags as keyphrase annotations.
- **Collection Method**: The dataset was collected using the Twitter advanced search API, focusing on tweets that contain both images and hashtags from January to June 2019. The authors detail the cleaning process, including retaining only tweets with one color image in JPG format and filtering out noise data.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since this dataset is newly created by the authors, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. However, I will note that the dataset is available at the provided URL: https://github.com/yuewang-cuhk/CMKP.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the citation or URL for access.

The final dataset entry will look like this:
- **Dataset Name**: Multi-modal Tweet Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset containing 53,701 tweets, each with a distinct text-image pair, collected from Twitter. The tweets include user-generated hashtags as keyphrase annotations.
- **Citation/URL**: Available at https://github.com/yuewang-cuhk/CMKP.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
