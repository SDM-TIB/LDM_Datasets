To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Point-to-Plane Registration by Efficient Backpropagation for Error Minimizing Function" by Tatsuya Yatagawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of point set registration and mention that their method is evaluated on several standard point cloud datasets. This indicates that datasets are likely to be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments in section 4, where they mention using specific datasets for evaluation. 

Upon reviewing section 4, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset includes 12,311 synthetic CAD models from 40 object categories, with 9,843 models for training and 2,468 for testing. It is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in various scenarios.

2. **ICL-NUIM**: This dataset consists of simulated depth scans of indoor scenes, providing a different context for evaluating the robustness of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015, 2015, 653–660.

- For **ICL-NUIM**, the citation is:
  > Choi, S., Zhou, Q.Y., & Koltun, V. (2015). *Robust reconstruction of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015, 5556–5565.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further research and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
