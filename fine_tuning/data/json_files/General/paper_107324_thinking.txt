To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Energy-Efficient Real-Time Heart Monitoring on Edge-Fog-Cloud Internet-of-Medical-Things" by Berken Utku Demirel et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed methodology achieves high accuracy on the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experimental setup section**. Here, the authors explicitly state that they used the **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset** and the **MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database** for their experiments. This confirms that both datasets are integral to their research.

In the **results section**, the authors provide performance metrics for their methodology using these datasets, further emphasizing their importance. They mention that the MIT-BIH dataset contains 48 half-hour recordings and that they combined it with the Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database to increase the number of abnormal beats for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**:
   > Moody, G. B., & Mark, R. G. (2001). The impact of the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. *IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine*, 20(3), 45-50.

2. **MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database**:
   > Greenwald, S. D. (1990). Improved detection and classification of arrhythmias in noise-corrupted electrocardiograms using contextual information. Ph.D. thesis, Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset**: A widely used dataset containing 48 half-hour ECG recordings from 47 subjects, digitized at 360 samples per second.

2. **MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia Database**: This dataset includes 78 half-hour ECG recordings, digitized at 120 Hz, used to enhance the training set for abnormal beat classification.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
