To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unlocking Masked Autoencoders as Loss Function for Image and Video Restoration" by Man Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments across multiple image and video tasks, which suggests that various datasets are likely involved. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of data in deep learning for image and video restoration, indicating that specific datasets will be referenced.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors describe their experimental settings and the datasets used for different tasks. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **SIDD Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for the image de-noising task. It is noted that the authors used it as a training benchmark and evaluated performance on validation samples from this dataset.

2. **DND Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned in the context of image de-noising, specifically for performance evaluation.

3. **DIV2K Dataset**: This dataset is used for the image super-resolution task and is described as containing 800 training images with 2K resolution.

4. **LOL Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for image enhancement tasks and consists of 500 low-/normal-light image pairs.

5. **Huawei Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned alongside the LOL dataset for image enhancement, containing 2480 paired images.

6. **DAVIS Dataset**: This dataset is referenced for video de-noising tasks, consisting of 90 training video sequences and 30 testing ones.

7. **Set8 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for video de-noising evaluation.

8. **WorldView II, WorldView III, and GaoFen2 Datasets**: These datasets are mentioned for guided image super-resolution tasks.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:
