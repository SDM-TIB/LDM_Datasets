To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating the Impact of Attribute Editing on Face Recognition" by Sudipta Banerjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention evaluating their methods on three datasets: **CelebA**, **CelebAMaskHQ**, and **LFW**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors provide more details about the datasets used. They specify that they conducted experiments using 300 subjects, with 100 subjects each from the **CelebA**, **CelebAMaskHQ**, and **LFW** datasets. This confirms the datasets mentioned in the abstract.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **related work** sections for any additional context or references to these datasets. However, the primary focus on these three datasets is already established in the earlier sections.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision, December 2015.

2. **CelebAMaskHQ Dataset**: The citation is:
   > C.-H. Lee, Z. Liu, L. Wu, and P. Luo. *Maskgan: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

3. **LFW Dataset**: The citation is:
   > G. B. Huang, M. Ramesh, T. Berg, and E. Learned-Miller. *Labeled faces in the wild: A database for studying face recognition in unconstrained environments*. Technical Report 07-49, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, October 2007.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CelebA**: A large-scale dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, annotated with 40 attribute labels.
- **CelebAMaskHQ**: A dataset that includes high-quality images with semantic segmentation masks for facial attributes.
- **LFW**: A dataset containing 13,000 labeled images of faces collected from the web, used for studying face recognition.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that the details are clear and accessible for future reference or analysis.
