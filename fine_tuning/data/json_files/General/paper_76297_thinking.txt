To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dirichlet-based Gaussian Processes for Large-scale Calibrated Classification" by Dimitrios Milios et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 5**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for a table or a list that details the datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant statistics such as the number of classes, training instances, test instances, and dimensionality.

In the provided text, I notice a **Table 1** that lists several datasets along with their respective details. I will extract the following datasets mentioned in the table:

1. **HTRU2 Dataset**: 
   - Classes: 2
   - Training instances: 10,980
   - Test instances: 4,000
   - Dimensionality: 14
   - Inducing points: 200

2. **MAGIC Dataset**: 
   - Classes: 2
   - Training instances: 12,898
   - Test instances: 5,000
   - Dimensionality: 10
   - Inducing points: 200

3. **LETTER Dataset**: 
   - Classes: 26
   - Training instances: 15,000
   - Test instances: 5,000
   - Dimensionality: 16
   - Inducing points: 200

4. **DRIVE Dataset**: 
   - Classes: 11
   - Training instances: 48,509
   - Test instances: 10,000
   - Dimensionality: 48
   - Inducing points: 500

5. **MOCAP Dataset**: 
   - Classes: 5
   - Training instances: 68,095
   - Test instances: 10,000
   - Dimensionality: 37
   - Inducing points: 500

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The paper mentions that the datasets are available from the UCI repository, which is a common source for many datasets in machine learning research. 

The citation for the UCI repository is:
> Asuncion, A., & Newman, D. J. (2007). UCI machine learning repository.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the UCI repository as the source for all datasets listed.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its respective details and citation.
