To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Forward Compatibility in Class Incremental Learning by Increasing Representation Rank and Feature Richness" by Jaeill Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of class incremental learning (CIL) and mention the use of various datasets for validation. However, I need to locate the specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe their experimental setup, including the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly mention using **CIFAR-100** and **ImageNet-100** as benchmark datasets for their experiments. 

Now, I will gather detailed information about these datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet-100**: This is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, which contains 100 classes and is widely used for benchmarking in computer vision tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further analysis.
