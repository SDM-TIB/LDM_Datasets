To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Toward Transformer-Based Object Detection" by Josh Beal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the ViT-FRCNN model and its performance on the COCO detection challenge, which suggests that the COCO dataset is likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors detail their evaluation methods. In this section, they specifically mention using the **COCO 2017 detection dataset** for validation, which is a key dataset for their experiments.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the context of pretraining. The authors reference several datasets used for pretraining the ViT backbone, including:

1. **ImageNet-21k**: A large-scale dataset with 14.2 million images and 21,000 labels.
2. **Annotations-1.3B**: An internal dataset with 1.3 billion images and 18,000 weakly-supervised labels.
3. **Open Images V6**: A dataset consisting of 1.7 million images with 15.8 million bounding boxes and 600 categories.
4. **ILSVRC-2012**: A smaller dataset with 1.2 million images and 1,000 categories.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

- For **COCO 2017**, the citation is:

- For **ImageNet-21k**, the citation is:

- For **Annotations-1.3B**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is mentioned as an internal dataset.

- For **Open Images V6**, the citation is:

  > Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, and Piotr Dollár. *Rethinking ImageNet Pre-Training*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 4918–4927, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the requirements. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
