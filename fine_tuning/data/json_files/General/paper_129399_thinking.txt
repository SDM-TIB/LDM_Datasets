To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rockmate: an Efficient, Fast, Automatic and Generic Tool for Re-materialization in PyTorch" by Xunyi Zhao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for experiments. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will specifically look for sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will pay attention to any dataset names, descriptions, and the context in which they are used.

In this paper, the authors do not explicitly mention any specific datasets used for training or evaluation in the experiments. Instead, they focus on the performance of their tool, Rockmate, in optimizing memory usage during the training of various neural network architectures, such as GPT2 and ResNet. They discuss the computational overhead and memory savings achieved but do not provide details about the datasets themselves.

Since no datasets are explicitly named in the paper, I will check the **References section** to see if there are any citations that refer to datasets indirectly, such as foundational datasets used in the models discussed. However, the references primarily cite other works related to optimization techniques and neural network architectures rather than specific datasets.

Given that no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract or cite. If there were datasets mentioned, I would have documented them along with their full citations.

In summary, I will note that the paper does not provide any datasets for extraction, and therefore, there are no dataset entries to compile.
