To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Bridging the Gap Between Variational Inference and Wasserstein Gradient Flows" by Mingxuan Yi and Song Liu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not contain detailed information about datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and may mention datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. This is typically where authors describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will pay attention to any specific names, descriptions, and characteristics of the datasets.

In this paper, I will specifically look for mentions of datasets related to variational inference or Wasserstein gradient flows. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided, such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

If the paper mentions any datasets without providing full citations, I will note that as well, indicating that further research may be needed to locate the original sources.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described with its full citation. This will facilitate easy reference and use in future research or applications.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining a focus on clarity and completeness in the citations.
