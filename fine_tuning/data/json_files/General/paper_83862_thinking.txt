To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterization of Glue Variables in CDCL SAT Solving" by Md Solimul Chowdhury, Martin Müller, and Jia-Huai You, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions experiments conducted using benchmarks from the SAT Competition-2017 and 2018, which suggests that these competitions provide datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe running experiments on **750 instances used in the main track of SAT-2017 and 2018**. This indicates that the datasets used for their experiments are the instances from these competitions.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a breakdown of the instances used, categorizing them into satisfiable, unsatisfiable, and unsolved. They mention that there are **350 instances from SAT-2017** and **400 instances from SAT-2018**. This categorization is crucial for understanding the datasets they utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets. The relevant citations for the datasets from the SAT competitions are as follows:

- For **SAT Competition 2017**, the citation is:
  > Fan Xiao, Mao Luo, Chu-Min Li, Felip Manya, and Zhipeng Lu. *MapleLRB_LCM, Maple_LCM, Maple_LCM_Dist, MapleLRB_LCMoccRestart and Glucose3.0+width in SAT Competition 2017*. In Proceedings of SAT Competition 2017, pages 22–23.

- For **SAT Competition 2018**, the citation is:
  > The SAT Competition 2018. *Proceedings of SAT Competition 2018*. Available at: [http://www.satcompetition.org/2018/](http://www.satcompetition.org/2018/).

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets used in the paper:

1. **SAT-2017 Instances**: A collection of 350 instances used in the SAT Competition 2017.
2. **SAT-2018 Instances**: A collection of 400 instances used in the SAT Competition 2018.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately captured and cited.
