To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the utility of feature selection in building two-tier decision trees" by S.A. Saltykov, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of synthetic and real datasets for demonstrating the effects of feature selection, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look at **section 5 (Complementary features on synthetic dataset)**, where the author presents a synthetic dataset used to illustrate the phenomenon of interfering with featuresâ€™ complementarity. The dataset is described in Table 1, which includes 19 samples and 3 features, along with the target variable. I will note the details of this synthetic dataset.

Then, I will examine **section 6 (Description of experiments and main results)**, where the author mentions three datasets used for experiments:

1. **Boston dataset (BOS)**: This dataset contains 506 samples and 14 features, including the target variable, which is the median price of a house in Boston neighborhoods. The author specifies a subset of this dataset with 379 samples based on a condition related to the number of rooms.

2. **Diabetes dataset (DIA)**: This dataset is aimed at predicting the presence or absence of diabetes. The author cites a reference for this dataset.

3. **Arrhythmia dataset (ARR)**: This dataset is used for predicting whether a patient has an arrhythmia. The author also cites a reference for this dataset.

I will ensure to extract the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Boston dataset**, the citation is:
  > Harrison Jr, D., Rubinfeld, D. L. (1978). *Hedonic housing prices and the demand for clean air*. Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 5(1), 81-102.

- For the **Diabetes dataset**, the citation is:
  > Smith, J. W., Everhart, J. E., Dickson, W. C., Knowler, W. C., Johannes, R. S. (1988, November). *Using the ADAP learning algorithm to forecast the onset of diabetes mellitus*. In Proceedings of the Annual Symposium on Computer Application in Medical Care (p. 261). American Medical Informatics Association.

- For the **Arrhythmia dataset**, the citation is:
  > Guvenir, H. A., Acar, B., Demiroz, G., Cekin, A. (1997, September). *A supervised machine learning algorithm for arrhythmia analysis*. In Computers in Cardiology 1997 (pp. 433-436). IEEE.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper.
