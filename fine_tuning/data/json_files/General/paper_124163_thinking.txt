To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Random Projection k Nearest Neighbours Ensemble for Classification via Extended Neighbourhood Rule" by Amjad Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "several benchmark datasets are used for assessing the performance of the proposed method," which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide a detailed discussion on the benchmark datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention that 15 benchmark problems are used, and a brief description is provided in Table 1.

In Table 1, I will extract the names of the datasets along with their details, including the number of observations, number of features, class distribution, and sources. The datasets listed are:

1. **KCBI Dataset**: 
   - Observations: 145

After gathering the dataset names and their details, I will ensure to write down the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references section of the paper. This will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets into a structured format for further processing or review.
