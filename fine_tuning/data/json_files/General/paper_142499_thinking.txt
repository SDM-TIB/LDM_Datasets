To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Light-weight Retinal Layer Segmentation with Global Reasoning" by Xiang He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on both a collected dataset and two public datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. This section is likely to provide detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and how they were used in the study.

In **subsection A (Datasets)**, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **Vis-105H dataset**: This dataset is created for evaluating the method and consists of images captured using a custom visible light OCT device. It includes 105 annotated images of healthy human eyes, with specific details about the annotation process and the number of images per class.

2. **Glaucoma dataset**: This dataset comprises images collected from 61 subjects, with specific details about the number of scans and the annotation process by ophthalmologists.

3. **DME dataset**: This dataset includes 110 OCT B-scans from patients with diabetic macular edema, detailing the number of images and the annotation process.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Vis-105H dataset**, the citation is:
  > W. Song, S. Zhang, Y. M. Kim, N. Sadlak, M. G. Fiorello, M. Desai, and J. Yi. "Visible light optical coherence tomography of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer reflectivity in glaucoma." *Translational Vision Science & Technology*, vol. 11, no. 9, pp. 28, 2022.

- For the **Glaucoma dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. K. Horn, C. Y. Mardin, R. Laemmer, D. Baleanu, A. M. Juenemann, F. E. Kruse, and R. P. Tornow. "Correlation between local glaucomatous visual field defects and loss of nerve fiber layer thickness measured with polarimetry and spectral domain OCT." *Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science*, vol. 50, no. 5, pp. 1971–1977, 2009.

- For the **DME dataset**, the citation is:
  > S. J. Chiu, M. J. Allingham, P. S. Mettu, S. W. Cousins, J. A. Izatt, and S. Farsiu. "Kernel regression based segmentation of optical coherence tomography images with diabetic macular edema." *Biomedical Optics Express*, vol. 6, no. 4, pp. 1172–1194, 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and that the full citations are included for reference. This structured approach will help in organizing the datasets effectively for further analysis or sharing.
