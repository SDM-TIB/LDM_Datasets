To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Vision Enhancing LLMs: Empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs" by Yunxin Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, they categorize the datasets into two main types: **Natural Language Processing Benchmarks** and **Image-Text Understanding Benchmarks**. This section is crucial as it provides specific names and descriptions of the datasets.

For the **Natural Language Processing Benchmarks**, the paper lists several datasets:
1. **MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021)**: A benchmark for evaluating language models on a variety of tasks.
2. **PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020)**: A dataset focused on physical commonsense reasoning.
3. **Commonsense QA (CSQA) (Talmor et al., 2019)**: A dataset for evaluating commonsense reasoning capabilities.
4. **OpenBook QA (OBQA) (Mihaylov et al., 2018)**: A dataset requiring multi-step reasoning and comprehension.
5. **RiddleSense (RS) (Lin et al., 2021)**: A dataset for understanding figurative language and counterfactual reasoning.
6. **Social IQA (Sap et al., 2019)**: A dataset testing social commonsense intelligence.
7. **StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021)**: A dataset that requires reasoning steps to be inferred using a strategy.

For the **Image-Text Understanding Benchmarks**, the paper mentions:
1. **VQAv2 (Antol et al., 2015)**: A visual question answering dataset with over 1 million samples.
2. **OK-VQA (Marino et al., 2019)**: A visual question answering benchmark requiring external knowledge.
3. **ST-VQA (Biten et al., 2019)**: A dataset for scene text visual question answering.
4. **OCR-VQA (Mishra et al., 2019)**: A dataset that includes question-answer pairs covering book cover images.
5. **TextVQA (Singh et al., 2019)**: A dataset focused on questions related to text on images.
6. **DocVQA (Mathew et al., 2021)**: A dataset for visual question answering on document images.

After identifying these datasets, I will then look at the **References section** to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is critical for ensuring that the datasets are properly attributed.
