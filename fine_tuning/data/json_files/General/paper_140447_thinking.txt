To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multifidelity linear regression for scientific machine learning from scarce data" by Elizabeth Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of high-fidelity and low-fidelity data, which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their approach and mention using data from different fidelity levels. I will pay close attention to any specific datasets that are referenced.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their numerical results. They mention:

1. **High-fidelity data** from a finite-difference solver for a hydrogen combustion model, which includes a large number of degrees of freedom.
2. **Low-fidelity data** from a POD-DEIM projection-based reduced model.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the original sources for the high-fidelity and low-fidelity models:

- For the high-fidelity model, the citation is:
  > B. Cuenot and T. Poinsot. *Asymptotic and numerical study of diffusion flames with variable lewis number and finite rate chemistry*. Combustion and Flame, 104(1-2):111â€“137, 1996.

- For the low-fidelity model, the citation is:
  > M. Buffoni and K. Willcox. *Projection-based model reduction for reacting flows*. In 40th Fluid Dynamics Conference and Exhibit, page 5008, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
