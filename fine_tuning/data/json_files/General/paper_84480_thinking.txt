To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Off-Policy Evaluation via Off-Policy Classification" by Alex Irpan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 6) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments in detail. This section often includes specific names, descriptions, and the context in which the datasets were used.

In the experiments section, I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments, such as:

1. **Robotic Grasping Dataset**: The authors mention using a dataset for training and testing their models in a robotic grasping task. I will note the details provided about the dataset, including the number of episodes, types of objects, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

2. **Pong Game Dataset**: The paper discusses using the Atari Pong game as a test environment. I will extract details about how the dataset was generated, including the number of episodes and the nature of the data collected.

3. **Binary Tree Environment**: The authors describe a binary tree MDP used for experiments. I will document the specifics of this dataset, including how it was structured and the parameters used.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets that are based on previous works. This is crucial for providing proper attribution.

For example, if the paper references a dataset like the **Atari Learning Environment**, I will ensure to include the citation:
> Bellemare, M. G., Naddaf, Y., Veness, J., & Bowling, M. (2013). The arcade learning environment: An evaluation platform for general agents. *Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research*, 47, 253-279.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
