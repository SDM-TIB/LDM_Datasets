To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Stochastic Differential Equations for Robust and Explainable Analysis of Electromagnetic Unintended Radiated Emissions" by Sumit Kumar Jha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and related work sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the "Flaming Moe dataset" created by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This indicates that there is a dataset relevant to their research. I will look for more details about this dataset in the subsequent sections.

Next, I will examine the **data collection and dataset section** (2.1) where the authors describe the Flaming Moe dataset in detail. They explain that it consists of real-world unintended electronic emissions collected from 18 devices, with specifics about the data collection process, including the duration and sampling rate. This section confirms the dataset's relevance and provides essential details.

I will also check the **experiments and results sections** to see if the dataset is referenced again, which can provide additional context on how it was used in the study. The authors discuss the dataset's role in evaluating the robustness and explainability of their models, reinforcing its importance.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the Flaming Moe dataset. The authors reference it as follows:

- For the Flaming Moe dataset, the citation is:
  > Jason Michael Vann, Thomas P Karnowski, Ryan Kerekes, Corey D Cooke, and Adam L Anderson. *A dimensionally aligned signal projection for classification of unintended radiated emissions*. IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, 60(1):122â€“131, 2017.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **Flaming Moe Dataset**: This dataset consists of real-world unintended radiated emissions collected from 18 different electronic devices. The data was captured in controlled conditions to ensure accuracy, with a sampling rate of 2 million samples per second over two 10-minute segments for each device.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
