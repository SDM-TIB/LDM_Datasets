To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Convergence Proof of the Split Bregman Method for Regularized Least-Squares Problems" by Hung Nien and Jeffrey A. Fessler, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will pay close attention to the introduction and experiments sections, where datasets are more likely to be discussed.

In the **introduction**, the authors describe the context of their work, focusing on image reconstruction problems. They mention various applications, such as parallel magnetic resonance (MR) and X-ray computed tomography (CT), but I need to look for specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (which is section 5 in this paper) to see if the authors provide details about the datasets used for their numerical experiments. This section typically contains information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention using a specific dataset for their numerical experiments related to image restoration. However, they do not provide a detailed description of the dataset or its citation within the text. Therefore, I will need to look at the **References section** to find the full citation for any datasets mentioned.

In the **References section**, I will search for any papers or datasets that are cited in relation to the experiments conducted in this paper. This may include foundational works or datasets that are commonly used in the field of image reconstruction.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the datasets into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as they appear in the references. This is crucial for proper attribution and for readers who may wish to access the datasets themselves.

Finally, I will summarize the findings, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for inclusion in any further analysis or documentation.
