To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Doubly Deformable Aggregation of Covariance Matrices for Few-shot Segmentation" by Zhitong Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot segmentation and the reliance on annotated datasets. This indicates that they will likely reference specific datasets later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Experiment Settings)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **PASCAL-5i**: This dataset is derived from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset and contains 20 object classes, split into 4 folds for few-shot segmentation tasks.

2. **COCO-20i**: This dataset consists of 80 object classes and is also split into 4 folds, designed for few-shot segmentation.

3. **FSS-1000**: This dataset includes 1,000 classes and is divided into training, validation, and testing subsets.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **PASCAL-5i**, the citation is:
  > Shaban, A., Bansal, S., Liu, Z., Essa, I., & Boots, B. (2017). *One-shot learning for semantic segmentation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.03410.

- For **COCO-20i**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., DollÃ¡r, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft coco: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision (pp. 740-755). Springer.

- For **FSS-1000**, the citation is:
  > Li, X., Wei, T., Chen, Y.P., Tai, Y.W., & Tang, C.K. (2020). *FSS-1000: A 1000-class dataset for few-shot segmentation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 2869-2878).

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
