To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fairness Continual Learning Approach to Semantic Scene Understanding in Open-World Environments" by Thanh-Dat Truong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard scene understanding benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ADE20K**: This dataset consists of more than 20,000 scene images across 150 semantic categories, with dense pixel-level annotations.
2. **Cityscapes**: A dataset containing 3,975 urban images with high-quality, dense labels of 30 semantic categories, specifically collected for autonomous driving tasks.
3. **PASCAL VOC**: A well-known dataset with over 10,000 images across 20 classes, commonly used for object detection and segmentation tasks.

In the experiments section, the authors confirm that these datasets are utilized for evaluating their proposed method, which reinforces their relevance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > B. Zhou, H. Zhao, X. Puig, S. Fidler, A. Barriuso, and A. Torralba. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In CVPR, pages 633â€“641, 2017.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > M. Cordts, M. Omran, S. Ramos, T. Rehfeld, M. Enzweiler, R. Benenson, U. Franke, S. Roth, and B. Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

- For **PASCAL VOC**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, S. M. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL visual object classes challenge: A retrospective*. IJCV, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are extracted and documented correctly for further use or analysis.
