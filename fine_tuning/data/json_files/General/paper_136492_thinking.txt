To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SoloPose: One-Shot Kinematic 3D Human Pose Estimation with Video Data Augmentation" by David C. Jeong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors address data diversity constraints with the **3D AugMotion Toolkit**, which suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets for 3D human pose estimation. They specifically mention four datasets: **Human3.6M**, **MADS**, **AIST Dance++**, and **MPI INF 3DHP**. This is a clear indication that these datasets are crucial to their research.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that they merge these four datasets using the **3D AugMotion Toolkit** to create a new dataset called **Humans7.1M**. This section provides additional context on how these datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
