To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TinyLlama: An Open-Source Small Language Model" by Peiyuan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that TinyLlama is pretrained on a large corpus, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2.1 (Pre-training data)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for pre-training TinyLlama. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **SlimPajama**: This dataset is derived from the RedPajama corpus and is described as a large open-source corpus created for training language models. It contains over 1.2 trillion tokens after cleaning and deduplication.

2. **Starcoderdata**: This dataset is specifically collected for training the StarCoder model and comprises approximately 250 billion tokens across 86 programming languages, including GitHub issues and text-code pairs.

In the **References section**, I will look for the full citations of these datasets to ensure proper attribution. The citations I find are:

- For **SlimPajama**, the citation is:
  > Soboleva, D., Al-Khateeb, F., Myers, R., Steeves, J. R., Hestness, J., and Dey, N. (2023). *SlimPajama: A 627B token cleaned and deduplicated version of RedPajama*.

- For **Starcoderdata**, the citation is:
  > Li, R., allal, L. B., Zi, Y., Muennighoff, N., Kocetkov, D., Mou, C., Marone, M., Akiki, C., LI, J., Chim, J., Liu, Q., Zheltonozhskii, E., Zhuo, T. Y., Wang, T., Dehaene, O., Lamy-Poirier, J., Monteiro, J., Gontier, N., Yee, M.-H., Umapathi, L. K., Zhu, J., Lipkin, B., Oblokulov, M., Wang, Z., Murthy, R., Stillerman, J. T., Patel, S. S., Abulkhanov, D., Zocca, M., Dey, M., Zhang, Z., Bhattacharyya, U., Yu, W., Luccioni, S., Villegas, P., Zhdanov, F., Lee, T., Timor, N., Ding, J., Schlesinger, C. S., Schoelkopf, H., Ebert, J., Dao, T., Mishra, M., Gu, A., Anderson, C. J., Dolan-Gavitt, B., Contractor, D., Reddy, S., Fried, D., Bahdanau, D., Jernite, Y., Ferrandis, C. M., Hughes, S., Wolf, T., Guha, A., Werra, L. V., and de Vries, H. (2023). *Starcoder: may the source be with you!*.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper citations.
