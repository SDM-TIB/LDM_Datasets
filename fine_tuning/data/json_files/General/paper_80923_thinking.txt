To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Feature Multi-Selection among Subjective Features" by Sivan Sabato and Adam Kalai, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions using a crowdsourced learning task to predict people's height and weight from photos, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their methodology. They mention using photos extracted from the **Photographic Height/Weight Chart**, which is a key dataset for their experiments. I will note this dataset and look for any additional datasets mentioned in the paper.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail that they collected judgments from the crowd using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and they refer to the **UCI dataset 'Relative location of CT slices on axial axis Data Set'** as another dataset used for their simulated experiment. This is important to document as well.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Photographic Height/Weight Chart**, the citation is:
   > Cockerham, Rob. The photographic height and weight chart. http://www.cockeyed.com/photos/bodies/heightweight.html, 2013. With permission of Rob Cockerham.

2. For the **UCI Relative location of CT slices on axial axis Data Set**, the citation is:
   > Frank, A. and Asuncion, A. UCI machine learning repository, 2010. URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
