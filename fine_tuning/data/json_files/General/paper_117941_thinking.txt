To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Top-K in SGD for Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning" by Mengzhe Ruan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors validated their proposed method on the **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10** datasets, indicating that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section V) for more detailed descriptions of these datasets. The authors confirm that they conducted experiments on the **MNIST** dataset using a fully-connected network and the **CIFAR-10** dataset using ResNet18. This section provides context on how these datasets were utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. While the datasets themselves (MNIST and CIFAR-10) are well-known, I will ensure to provide their authoritative citations:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured output that is ready for review or further processing.
