To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MetaLLM: A High-performant and Cost-efficient Dynamic Framework for Wrapping LLMs" by Quang H. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section (Section 4)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they explicitly mention two datasets used for text classification tasks:

1. **SST-2 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a binary sentiment analysis dataset consisting of movie reviews, with 67,439 training samples and 872 test samples. They also mention that 100 samples from the test set were selected to form a validation set.

2. **IMDB Dataset**: This dataset is noted to have 25,000 training samples and 25,000 test samples, with 2,000 samples extracted from the test set to create a validation set.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets directly. Therefore, I will rely on commonly known references for these datasets:

- For the **SST-2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Socher, R., Perelygin, A., Wu, J., Chuang, J., Manning, C. D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2013). *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642.

- For the **IMDB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, P. F., Pham, P. T., Huang, J., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). *Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis*. In Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, pages 142–150.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation.
