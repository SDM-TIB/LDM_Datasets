To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Knowledge Distillation for BERT Models: Loss Functions, Mapping Methods, and Weight Tuning" by Adeem Jassani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating techniques on a selection of downstream tasks from the **GLUE benchmark**, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their focus on knowledge distillation for the **TinyBERT** model and mention evaluating their techniques on tasks from the **GLUE benchmark**. This indicates that the datasets used are likely part of this benchmark.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **section 4**, they explicitly state that they used two datasets from the GLUE benchmark: **CoLA** and **STS-B**. 

1. **CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the acceptability of sentences in English. It consists of 10,657 sentences labeled as acceptable or unacceptable.

2. **STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)**: This dataset is used for evaluating the similarity between pairs of sentences. It contains 5,749 sentence pairs, each labeled with a similarity score ranging from 0 to 5.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the GLUE benchmark, which includes both datasets:

- For **CoLA**, the citation is:
  > Alex Warstadt, Amanpreet Singh, and Samuel R Bowman. *Neural network acceptability judgments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.12471, 2018.

- For **STS-B**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Eneko Agirre, Inigo Lopez-Gazpio, and Lucia Specia. *Semeval-2017 task 1: Semantic textual similarity-multilingual and cross-lingual focused evaluation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.00055, 2017.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
