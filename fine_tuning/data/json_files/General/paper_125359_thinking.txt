To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder" by Abhimanyu Das et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the model and its performance, but I need to look deeper for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention using **seven commonly used long-term forecasting benchmark datasets**: Weather, Traffic, Electricity, and four ETT datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2). This is a clear indication that these datasets are central to their research.

In this section, the authors provide a summary table (Table 1) that includes the number of time-series and time-points for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the scale and nature of the datasets used.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The authors refer to a previous work for detailed discussions on the datasets, specifically citing Wu et al. (2021). Therefore, I will locate the citation for this paper to provide the necessary details for the datasets mentioned.

The citation for the Wu et al. (2021) paper is:
> Wu, H., Xu, J., Wang, J., & Long, M. (2021). Autoformer: Decomposition transformers with auto-correlation for long-term series forecasting. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 22419â€“22430.

This citation will serve as the authoritative reference for the datasets used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including the names and descriptions, along with their citations, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified and properly referenced.

The datasets extracted from the paper are:

1. **Weather Dataset**: A dataset containing time-series data related to weather conditions.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

2. **Traffic Dataset**: A dataset with time-series data on traffic conditions.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

3. **Electricity Dataset**: A dataset containing electricity consumption time-series data.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

4. **ETTh1 Dataset**: A specific dataset from the ETT collection, used for time-series forecasting.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

5. **ETTh2 Dataset**: Another dataset from the ETT collection, also used for forecasting.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

6. **ETTm1 Dataset**: A dataset from the ETT collection, utilized in the experiments.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

7. **ETTm2 Dataset**: The final dataset from the ETT collection mentioned in the paper.
   - Citation: Wu et al. (2021).

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
