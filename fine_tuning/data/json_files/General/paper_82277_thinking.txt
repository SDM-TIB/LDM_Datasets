To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Scene Categorization from Contours: Medial Axis Based Salience Measures" by Morteza Rezanejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves line drawings derived from popular databases, which suggests that datasets are involved. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention the **Artist Scenes Database**, which consists of line drawings generated from photographs of natural scenes. They specify that this database contains 475 line drawings across six categories. 

In **section 4.2**, the authors refer to two additional datasets: **MIT67** and **Places365**. They explain that these datasets are used to extend their results and provide details about their sizes and categories. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **Artist Scenes Database**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the references, but it is described as a collection of line drawings generated by artists from selected photographs.

2. **MIT67 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Quattoni, A., & Torralba, A. (2009). Recognizing indoor scenes. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 413-420).

3. **Places365 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Zhou, B., Lapedriza, A., Khosla, A., Oliva, A., & Torralba, A. (2018). Places: A 10 million image database for scene recognition. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 40(12), 1452-1464.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for reference.
