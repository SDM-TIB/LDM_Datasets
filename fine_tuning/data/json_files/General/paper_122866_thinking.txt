To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Beyond Moments: Robustly Learning Affine Transformations with Asymptotically Optimal Error" by He Jia, Pravesh K. Kothari, and Santosh S. Vempala, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, such as "we used the XYZ dataset" or "the experiments were conducted on the ABC dataset."

If the paper includes a **datasets section**, I will pay close attention to it, as it will likely provide comprehensive details about each dataset, including how they were collected, their structure, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will look for citations that provide the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For each dataset identified, I will summarize the following information:
1. **Name of the dataset**: The official name as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and any relevant details (e.g., number of samples, features).
3. **Full citation**: The complete reference for the dataset as found in the references section.

Once I have gathered all this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its description and citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure a thorough and accurate extraction of datasets from the research paper.
