To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Formal verification of unknown dynamical systems via Gaussian process regression" by John Jackson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses a framework for verifying dynamical systems using input-output datasets, which suggests that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention a dataset \( D = \{(x_i, a_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^d \) generated by the process they are studying. This indicates that they are using a dataset for their experiments, but I need to find more details about it.

In the **experiments** section, the authors describe the datasets used for their case studies. They mention that they generated synthetic measurements by uniformly sampling states from a compact set \( X \) and adding Gaussian noise. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset, as it appears to be a synthetic dataset created for the purpose of their experiments.

I will also check the **case studies** section, where they describe the datasets used for various systems. They mention using a dataset of 2000 points for GP regression in the nonlinear system case study, but again, this is a synthetic dataset without a formal citation.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets or provide citations for the synthetic datasets used, I will note that the datasets are generated for the experiments but lack formal citations. 

Now, I will compile the findings:

1. **Synthetic Dataset for Unknown Dynamical Systems**: This dataset is generated by uniformly sampling states from a compact set \( X \) and adding Gaussian noise. It is used throughout the experiments but does not have a formal citation as it is not a publicly available dataset.

2. **Dataset for Linear System Verification**: The authors mention using a dataset of 2000 points for GP regression in their nonlinear system case study, but again, this is a synthetic dataset without a formal citation.

Since there are no formal citations provided for the datasets in the paper, I will summarize that the datasets are synthetic and generated for the purpose of the experiments, and I will note the lack of formal citations.

In conclusion, I will prepare a summary of the datasets extracted from the paper, emphasizing the synthetic nature of the datasets and the absence of formal citations.
