To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tractable Diversity: Scalable Multiperspective Ontology Management via Standpoint EL" by Lucía Gómez Álvarez, Sebastian Rudolph, and Hannes Strass, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often outlines the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets or experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets they used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets," "Data," or "Experiments." This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sources, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

If the paper includes a **results or discussion section**, I will check there as well, as authors sometimes refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their names and any relevant details provided in the text. It is crucial to also check the **References section** for full citations of the datasets. This is important because the datasets may have been introduced in other papers, and I need to provide accurate citations.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "SNOMED CT," I would look for its citation in the references. If the citation is not directly provided, I may need to search for the original paper or source that introduced the dataset to ensure I have the correct citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will format the extracted information according to the required structure, ready for further processing or review.
