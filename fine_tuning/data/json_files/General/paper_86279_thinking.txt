To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Accurate and Compact Convolutional Neural Networks with Trained Binarization" by Zhe Xu and Ray C.C. Cheung, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method achieves certain accuracies on specific datasets, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors discuss their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 10 classes. The authors report achieving 92.3% accuracy on this dataset using their proposed method.

2. **ImageNet ILSVRC12**: This is a large-scale dataset containing approximately 1.2 million training images across 1,000 classes and 50,000 validation images. The authors report achieving 46.1% top-1 accuracy and 70.9% top-5 accuracy on this dataset with their method.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

- For **ImageNet ILSVRC12**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International journal of computer vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
