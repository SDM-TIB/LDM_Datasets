To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learn To Remember: Transformer with Recurrent Memory for Document-Level Machine Translation" by Yukun Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three popular datasets for document-level machine translation, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **TED**: The training data for TED comes from IWSLTâ€™17, with specific test and validation sets mentioned.
2. **News**: This dataset is derived from News Commentary v11, with similar details about the test and validation sets.
3. **Europarl**: The authors state that the train, valid, and test sets are extracted from the Europarl v7 corpus.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **TED dataset**, the citation is:
  > IWSLT. *International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation*. 2017. Available at: http://iwslt.org/2017/

- For the **News dataset**, the citation is:
  > News Commentary. *News Commentary v11*. 2017. Available at: https://www.statmt.org/wmt17/translation-task.html

- For the **Europarl dataset**, the citation is:
  > Philipp Koehn et al. *Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the 7th Conference on the International Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), 2010. Available at: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
