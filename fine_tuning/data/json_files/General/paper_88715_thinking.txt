To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-layer Optimizations for End-to-End Data Analytics" by Amir Shaikhha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors benchmark their framework against several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section** where the authors describe the datasets used for their benchmarks. They specifically mention two datasets:

1. **Favorita Dataset**: This dataset is described as a publicly available Kaggle dataset used for grocery sales forecasting. The paper provides a reference to the dataset's source.

2. **Retailer Dataset**: This dataset is from a US retailer and is used for inventory forecasting. The authors also provide a reference for this dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Favorita Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Corporacion Favorita. 2017. *Corp. Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting: Can you accurately predict sales for a large grocery chain?* https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/

- For the **Retailer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Xixuan Feng, Arun Kumar, Benjamin Recht, and Christopher Ré. 2012. *Towards a Unified Architecture for in-RDBMS Analytics*. In Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD ’12). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 325–336.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
