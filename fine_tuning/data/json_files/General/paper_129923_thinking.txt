To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent model for offshore China sea fog forecasting" by Yanfei Xiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning one year, which includes weather station observations and historical forecasts. This suggests that there is a dataset that needs to be detailed.

Next, I will examine the **Materials and Methods** section, particularly the **Data and Preprocessing** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that they utilized observations of visibility conditions and numerical weather forecast data from 2014 to 2020. They specify that the observations were obtained from the Meteorological Information Comprehensive Analysis and Process System (MICAPS), which provides various weather measurements.

I will note the following datasets:

1. **Visibility Conditions Dataset**: This dataset includes observations of visibility conditions recorded at 3-hour intervals from various weather stations in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) region.

2. **WRF-NMM Forecast Data**: The authors used historical forecast data from the Weather Research and Forecasting Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (WRF-NMM) provided by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). This dataset features a horizontal resolution of 8×8 km and includes hourly predictions for a 60-hour forecast period.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MICAPS dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the paper, but I will note that it is a system used for weather measurements in China.

- For the **WRF-NMM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Janjic, Z. (2003). A nonhydrostatic model based on a new approach. *Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics*, 82(1–4), 271–285. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00703-001-0587-6.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes the necessary citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the study, ready for further processing or review.
