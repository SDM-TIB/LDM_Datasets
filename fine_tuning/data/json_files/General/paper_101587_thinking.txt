To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Transformer Meets Convolution: A Bilateral Awareness Network for Semantic Segmentation of Very Fine Resolution Urban Scene Images" by Libo Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **three large-scale urban scene image segmentation datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**: This dataset consists of 33 very fine resolution images with an average size of 2494 × 2064 pixels and a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 9 cm. The authors specify how they split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset includes 38 fine-resolution images covering urban scenes, each with a size of 6000 × 6000 pixels and a GSD of 5 cm. The authors also describe the training, validation, and testing splits for this dataset.

3. **UAVid Dataset**: This dataset focuses on urban street scenes captured by UAVs, consisting of 420 images with a resolution of 3840 × 2160 pixels. The authors detail the distribution of images for training, validation, and testing.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS. *ISPRS Vaihingen Benchmark*. Available online: https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/benchmark/2d-sem-label-vaihingen/

- For the **ISPRS Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS. *ISPRS Potsdam Benchmark*. Available online: https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm2/wg4/benchmark/2d-sem-label-potsdam/

- For the **UAVid Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lyu, Y.; Vosselman, G.; Xia, G.-S.; Yilmaz, A.; Yang, M.Y. *UAVid: A semantic segmentation dataset for UAV imagery*. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 2020, 165, 108-119, doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
