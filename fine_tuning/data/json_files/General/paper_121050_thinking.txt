To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mind Reasoning Manners: Enhancing Type Perception for Generalized Zero-shot Logical Reasoning over Text" by Fangzhi Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract introduces a new benchmark for generalized zero-shot logical reasoning called **ZsLR**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors reference the **ReClor dataset** as the basis for their new benchmark, which is a strong indication that it is a key dataset used in their research.

In the **methods section**, particularly in the subsection discussing the benchmark of generalized ZsLR, the authors detail how they constructed the zero-shot splits based on the **ReClor dataset**. They mention that the ReClor dataset contains 6,138 examples with 17 reasoning types, which confirms its significance in their study.

Additionally, the authors mention another dataset, **LogiQA**, which is used for comparison in their experiments. They provide details about the number of samples in LogiQA, indicating that it contains 8,678 samples with 5 reasoning types.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ReClor dataset**, the citation is:
   > W. Yu, Z. Jiang, Y. Dong, and J. Feng. *ReClor: A Reading Comprehension Dataset Requiring Logical Reasoning*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2019.

2. For the **LogiQA dataset**, the citation is:
   > J. Liu, L. Cui, H. Liu, D. Huang, Y. Wang, and Y. Zhang. *LogiQA: A Challenge Dataset for Machine Reading Comprehension with Logical Reasoning*. In Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 2021.

Having gathered this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I include all necessary details for future reference or processing.
