To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training Spiking Neural Networks with Local Tandem Learning" by Qu Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the proposed method achieves rapid network convergence on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** and also mentions **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny ImageNet** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for detailed descriptions of how these datasets were utilized. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **Tiny ImageNet** datasets. They provide some context about the datasets, such as the number of classes and images, which is crucial for understanding their application in the study.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

3. **Tiny ImageNet**:
   > Jiayu Wu, Qixiang Zhang, and Guoxi Xu. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge*. Technical report, 2017.

Although CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 share the same citation, they are distinct datasets, so I will ensure to note that in the dataset entries.

Finally, I will compile the information into structured entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
