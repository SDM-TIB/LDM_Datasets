To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DWRSeg: Rethinking Efficient Acquisition of Multi-scale Contextual Information for Real-time Semantic Segmentation" by Haoran Wei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **Cityscapes** and **CamVid** datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors explicitly mention that they used the **Cityscapes** dataset, which is described as an urban street scenes semantic segmentation dataset with 19 classes, and the **CamVid** dataset, which is a road scene dataset with 11 classes. This confirms that both datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Cityscapes dataset**, the citation is:
   > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 3213–3223, 2016.

2. For the **CamVid dataset**, the citation is:
   > Gabriel J Brostow, Jamie Shotton, Julien Fauqueur, and Roberto Cipolla. *Segmentation and recognition using structure from motion point clouds*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 44–57. Springer, 2008.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for both datasets as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
