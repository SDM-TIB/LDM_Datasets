To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Occlusion-Aware Instance Segmentation via BiLayer Network Architectures" by Lei Ke et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on various image instance segmentation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, they mention several datasets:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This is a well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks. The authors state that they trained on the 2017 train split and evaluated on the validation and test splits.

2. **COCO-OCC**: This is a subset of the COCO dataset specifically created for evaluating occlusion handling, consisting of 1,005 images with significant overlapping objects.

3. **KINS Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as the largest amodal segmentation benchmark for traffic scenes, containing both annotated amodal and modal masks.

4. **COCOA Dataset**: This is a subpart of the COCO dataset, used for amodal instance segmentation, with specific training and validation splits.

5. **Synthetic Occlusion Dataset (SOD)**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 100,000 synthetic images with occluded objects, generated to aid in training their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For the **KINS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > L. Qi, L. Jiang, S. Liu, X. Shen, and J. Jia. *Amodal Instance Segmentation with KINS Dataset*. In CVPR, 2019.

- For the **COCOA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Y. Zhu, Y. Tian, D. Metaxas, and P. Dollár. *Semantic Amodal Segmentation*. In CVPR, 2017.

- For the **Synthetic Occlusion Dataset (SOD)**, the authors do not provide a formal citation in the references, but they describe the dataset in detail in the paper itself.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
