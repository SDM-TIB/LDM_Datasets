To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ChessGPT: Bridging Policy Learning and Language Modeling" by Xidong Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets. The abstract mentions the construction of a "large-scale game and language dataset related to chess," which indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (A large-scale game and language dataset for chess)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets they curated. Here, I will identify the specific datasets mentioned:

1. **Lichess Dataset**: This dataset consists of 17.5 million game replay records collected over five months from the Lichess database. It captures online game data from various players.

2. **Pro-player Dataset**: This dataset includes 440,000 game records from 245 professional chess players, enhancing the diversity of skill levels in the dataset.

3. **CCRL Dataset**: A collection of 3 million chess games played by computer chess engines, stored in PGN format, sourced from the Computer Chess Rating Lists (CCRL).

4. **Chess Puzzles Dataset**: This dataset contains 3.2 million chess puzzles sourced from the Lichess puzzle dataset, each annotated with its rating and solution.

5. **Chess Modeling Dataset**: A synthetic dataset created to help machine learning models understand chess rules, containing 1.9 million data samples generated from various chess tasks.

6. **Language Dataset**: This dataset is derived from existing language corpora, including C4, Pile, Oscar, and Wikipedia, filtered to extract chess-related content.

7. **Annotated Chess Games Dataset**: This dataset comprises 245,000 annotated chess games collected from various sources, providing insights into game strategies and player intentions.

8. **YouTube Transcripts Dataset**: This dataset includes transcripts from approximately 83,000 chess-related YouTube videos, providing a mixed game-language dataset.

9. **Instruction-Tuning and Conversation Dataset**: This dataset consists of instruction data generated using GPT-4 and conversation data collected from Reddit, aimed at enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of language models.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will include:

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its description, and the corresponding citation, ensuring that the extraction process is thorough and accurate.
