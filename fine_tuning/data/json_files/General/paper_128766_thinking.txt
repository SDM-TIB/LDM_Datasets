To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding-based Neural Representation" by Ho Man Kwan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the proposed method has been evaluated on the **UVG** and **MCL-JCV** datasets, which suggests these are the primary datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of these datasets. In section 4.2, the authors explicitly mention that the proposed method has been tested against existing methods on both the **UVG** and **MCL-JCV** datasets. This confirms their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **UVG Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Mercat, A., Viitanen, M., & Vanne, J. (2020). UVG Dataset: 50/120fps 4K Sequences for Video Codec Analysis and Development. In *MMSys*, pages 297–302. ACM.

2. **MCL-JCV Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Wang, H., Gan, W., Hu, S., Lin, J. Y., Jin, L., Song, L., Wang, P., Katsavounidis, I., Aaron, A., & Kuo, C. J. (2016). MCL-JCV: A JND-based H.264/AVC video quality assessment dataset. In *ICIP*, pages 1509–1513. IEEE.

Having gathered the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **UVG Dataset**: Used for video codec analysis and development, consisting of high-resolution video sequences.
- **MCL-JCV Dataset**: A dataset designed for video quality assessment based on Just Noticeable Difference (JND) metrics.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
