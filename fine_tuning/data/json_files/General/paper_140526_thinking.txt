To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MT-PATCHER: Selective and Extendable Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models for Machine Translation" by Jiahuan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the framework MT-PATCHER and its evaluation on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the use of existing machine translation models and refer to "general MT benchmarks" without specifying names. This indicates that there may be datasets used for evaluation, but I need to look further for specifics.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their experimental settings and mention specific datasets used for training and evaluation. They refer to the **WMT22** datasets for Chinese to English and English to German translations. This is a clear indication of datasets being utilized.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors specify that they randomly selected 1,000,000 sentences from **RefinedWeb** and **WuDao 2.0** as their monolingual corpus for the experiments. This gives me the names of the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **RefinedWeb**: The citation is:
   > Guilherme Penedo, Quentin Malartic, Daniel Hesslow, Ruxandra Cojocaru, Alessandro Cappelli, Hamza Alobeidli, Baptiste Pannier, Ebtesam Almazrouei, and Julien Launay. *The RefinedWeb dataset for Falcon LLM: outperforming curated corpora with web data, and web data only*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.01116.

2. **WuDao 2.0**: The citation is:
   > Sha Yuan, Hanyu Zhao, Zhengxiao Du, Ming Ding, Xiao Liu, Yukuo Cen, Xu Zou, Zhilin Yang, and Jie Tang. *WuDaoCorpora: A super large-scale Chinese corpora for pre-training language models*. AI Open, 2.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations for future reference or use.
