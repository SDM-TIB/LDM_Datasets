To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic neural network with memristive CIM and CAM for 2D and 3D vision" by Yue Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their co-design using the **MNIST** and **ModelNet** datasets for image and 3D point classification tasks. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look into the **results** and **experiments** sections, specifically focusing on any detailed descriptions of how these datasets were used. In the results section, the authors mention that they achieved notable reductions in computational budget and energy consumption while classifying the **MNIST** dataset using ResNet and the **ModelNet** dataset using PointNet++. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **Materials and Methods** section for any additional details about the datasets. The authors describe the **MNIST** dataset as a standard dataset for handwritten digit classification, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. For the **ModelNet** dataset, they mention that it is used for 3D shape classification and consists of various categories of 3D objects.

Finally, I will refer to the **References** section to gather the full citations for these datasets:

1. **MNIST Dataset**:
   > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. *Proceedings of the IEEE*, 86(11), 2278-2324.

2. **ModelNet Dataset**:
   > Wu, Z., et al. (2015). 3D ShapeNets: A deep representation for volumetric shapes. *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, 1912-1920.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the necessary citations. This structured approach will help in organizing the extracted data effectively for further analysis or processing.
