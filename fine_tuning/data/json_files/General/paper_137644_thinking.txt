To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Machine Learning-Based Analysis of Ebola Virusâ€™ Impact on Gene Expression in Nonhuman Primates" by Mostafa Rezapour et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes a comprehensive dataset of NanoString gene expression profiles from Ebola-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs), which suggests that this dataset is crucial for the analysis.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **materials and methods section**. Here, the authors describe the dataset in detail, stating that it consists of NanoString gene expression profiles from NHPs infected with the Ebola virus, specifically focusing on 769 transcripts. This confirms the dataset's relevance and provides context for its use in the study.

In the **results section**, the authors reference the dataset multiple times while discussing their findings, particularly in relation to gene expression changes and the identification of biomarkers. This reinforces the importance of the dataset in their analysis.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors cite the work of Speranza et al. [1] as the source of the NanoString gene expression data. The full citation for this dataset is:

> Speranza, E., Bixler, S.L., Altamura, L.A., Arnold, C.E., Pratt, W.D., Taylor-Howell, C., Burrows, C., Aguilar, W., Rossi, F., Shamblin, J.D., and Wollen, S.E. "A conserved transcriptional response to intranasal EBOV exposure in nonhuman primates prior to onset of fever," *Science Translational Medicine*, vol. 10, no. 434, p. eaaq1016, 2018.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset:

1. **Dataset Name**: NanoString gene expression profiles from Ebola-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs).
2. **Description**: This dataset includes gene expression profiles focusing on 769 specific NHP transcripts, which were analyzed to understand the impact of Ebola virus infection on gene expression.
3. **Full Citation**: Speranza, E., Bixler, S.L., Altamura, L.A., Arnold, C.E., Pratt, W.D., Taylor-Howell, C., Burrows, C., Aguilar, W., Rossi, F., Shamblin, J.D., and Wollen, S.E. "A conserved transcriptional response to intranasal EBOV exposure in nonhuman primates prior to onset of fever," *Science Translational Medicine*, vol. 10, no. 434, p. eaaq1016, 2018.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
