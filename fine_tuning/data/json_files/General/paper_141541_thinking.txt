To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TSCM: A Teacher-Student Model for Vision Place Recognition Using Cross-Metric Knowledge Distillation" by Yehui Shen et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted evaluations on "large-scale datasets, namely Pittsburgh30k and Pittsburgh250k." This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experimental evaluation** section. In the paper, the authors describe their experimental setup, stating that they evaluated their method on the **Pittsburgh dataset**, which includes both **Pittsburgh30k** and **Pittsburgh250k**. They mention that the original Pittsburgh dataset encompasses 250,000 training samples and 24,000 test query samples, and they used a reduced subset of 10,000 samples for training and validation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are as follows:

- For **Pittsburgh30k**, the citation is:
  > A. Torii, J. Sivic, M. Okutomi, and T. Pajdla. "Visual place recognition with repetitive structures." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)*, vol. 37, no. 11, pp. 2346â€“2359, 2015.

- For **Pittsburgh250k**, the citation is the same as for Pittsburgh30k, as it is part of the same dataset collection.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Pittsburgh30k**: A dataset containing 30,000 images sourced from Google Street View, used for training and testing visual place recognition models.

2. **Pittsburgh250k**: A larger dataset that includes 250,000 images, also sourced from Google Street View, used for extensive evaluations in visual place recognition tasks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This systematic approach ensures that I accurately capture the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
