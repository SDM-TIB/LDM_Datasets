To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Context-Aware Neural Video Compression on Solar Dynamics Observatory" by Atefeh Khoshkhahtinat et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission and the need for data compression, which suggests that datasets related to solar images are involved. The introduction further elaborates on the SDO mission and its data collection, indicating that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that the research relies on the extensive data collected during the SDO mission, specifically highlighting the instruments involved, such as the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). 

The authors specify that the original SDO dataset has been preprocessed to create a machine learning-ready dataset known as **SDOML**. They describe the contents of the SDOML dataset, which includes AIA images captured at various wavelengths, specifically noting that AIA images at the wavelength of 94 Å are utilized for both training and testing.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to gather full citations for the datasets mentioned. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)** dataset:
   > "A guide to the mission and purpose of NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory," 2010. [Online]. Available: https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/docs/SDO_Guide.pdf

2. For the **SDOML dataset**:
   > Galvez, R., Fouhey, D. F., Jin, M., Szenicer, A., Muñoz-Jaramillo, A., Cheung, M. C., Wright, P. J., Bobra, M. G., Liu, Y., Mason, J. "A machine-learning data set prepared from the NASA solar dynamics observatory mission," The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, 2019.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

1. **Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Dataset**: This dataset is collected by NASA's SDO mission, which captures extensive data on solar activity. It includes images from various instruments designed to study the Sun.

2. **SDOML Dataset**: This is a machine learning-ready dataset derived from the original SDO dataset, specifically containing AIA images at different wavelengths, with a focus on the 94 Å wavelength for training and testing video compression networks.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
