To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Inhibition through Maximally Tense Images" by Chris Hamblin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the concept of maximally tense images (MTIs) and their role in understanding feature inhibition, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. Therefore, I will need to look deeper into the paper.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** and any subsequent sections that might detail experiments or analyses. I will specifically look for mentions of datasets used for training or testing the models. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and descriptions.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any references to datasets used in the experiments. If the authors describe how they conducted their experiments, they may mention specific datasets that were utilized. For example, if they refer to a dataset like ImageNet or any other dataset, I will take note of it.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial as I need to provide complete and accurate citations.

For instance, if the authors mention using the **ImageNet dataset**, I will look for the citation in the references, which is typically formatted as follows:
> J. Deng, W. Dong, R. Socher, L.-J. Li, K. Li, and L. Fei-Fei. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In CVPR09, 2009.

If they mention any other datasets, I will follow the same process to find their citations.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
