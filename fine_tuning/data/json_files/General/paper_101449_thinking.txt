To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised classification of cell imaging data using the quantization error in a Self-Organizing Map" by B. Dresp-Langley and J.M. Wandeto, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the study involves **96 image simulations** related to cell viability, which suggests that there is a dataset involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets. They mention using the quantization error in a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for analyzing biological imaging data, but I need to find specific dataset details.

In the **materials and methods section**, the authors describe the generation of **96 cell viability images** with variable RED-GREEN color staining. They specify that these images were computer-generated and indicate the parameters used for creating these images, such as the size (831x594 pixels) and the variations in cell viability (between 44% and 56%). This section confirms that the dataset consists of these 96 images.

I will also check the **results section** to see if there are any additional details about the dataset or its usage in the experiments. The results indicate that the SOM-QE was computed for all images, reinforcing that these 96 images are the primary dataset used in the study.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the dataset is generated by the authors themselves and does not reference an external dataset, I will note that the dataset is original to this study.

The full citation for the paper is:
> B. Dresp-Langley, J.M. Wandeto. *Unsupervised classification of cell imaging data using the quantization error in a Self-Organizing Map*. In HR Arabnia, K Ferens, D de la Fuente, EB Kozerenko, JA Olivas Varela, FG Tinetti (Eds.), Transactions on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence. Springer-Nature, pp. 201-210, 2021.

In summary, the dataset extracted from the paper consists of **96 cell viability images** generated for the study, and the citation for the dataset is the same as the paper itself since it is an original dataset created by the authors.
