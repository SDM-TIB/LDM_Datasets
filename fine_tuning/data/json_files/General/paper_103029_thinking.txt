To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MobileStereoNet: Towards Lightweight Deep Networks for Stereo Matching" by Faranak Shamsafar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it often highlights the context in which they are used. The introduction typically discusses the background and may reference specific datasets used in previous works.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach in detail. This section often includes information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **experimental results section**, the authors usually provide details about the datasets used for testing their models. This section may include performance metrics on specific datasets, which can help confirm their relevance to the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my reading, I expect to find the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **SceneFlow Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of training and evaluating the proposed models. It consists of synthetic stereo images and ground truth disparity maps, which are essential for training deep learning models in stereo matching.

2. **KITTI 2015 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of the models on real-world driving scenarios. It contains stereo image pairs and ground truth disparity maps, making it a standard benchmark in the field of stereo matching.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
