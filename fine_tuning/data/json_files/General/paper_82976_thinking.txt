To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Robustness Certificates Against Adversarial Examples for ReLU Networks" by Sahil Singla and Soheil Feizi, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of robustness certificates over the **MNIST dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 5, the authors explicitly state that they assess their proposed robustness certificates on the **MNIST dataset** for a binary classification task. They also mention using a deeper network for the MNIST dataset, which further confirms its use.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset, and its citation is as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset for its experiments, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry for the MNIST dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required. This will be ready for downstream processing or review.
