To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Speaker Diarization with Session-Level Speaker Embedding Refinement Using Graph Neural Networks" by Jixuan Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of a GNN for speaker diarization and references performance on the NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME database, indicating that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Datasets and implementation details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME**: This dataset is used for evaluating the x-vector-based systems. The authors specify that they report results on this dataset, which is crucial for their experiments.

2. **VoxCeleb2**: This dataset is used for training the d-vector extraction model. The authors explain that they simulate conversations from this dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME**, the citation is:
  > "NIST SRE 2000 CALLHOME" (LDC2001S97), Linguistic Data Consortium, 2001.

- For **VoxCeleb2**, the citation is:
  > Joon Son Chung, Arsha Nagrani, and Andrew Zisserman. *Voxceleb2: Deep speaker recognition*. In Proc. Interspeech 2018, pages 1086â€“1090, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, ensuring to include their names, descriptions, and full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and ease of understanding, ready for any further processing or review.
