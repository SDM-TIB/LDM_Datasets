To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Knowledge Graph Evaluation Under the Open-World Assumption" by Haotong Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the evaluation of knowledge graph completion (KGC) models and mentions the use of datasets, which indicates that there are specific datasets relevant to the research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to existing datasets in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **background and related work** section to see if the authors reference any datasets that are commonly used in the field of knowledge graph completion. This section often provides context and may include citations of foundational datasets.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors provide details about how these datasets were constructed or any modifications made, I will note those as well.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

From my review, I expect to find at least two datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **FB15k-237 Dataset**: This dataset is commonly used for knowledge graph completion tasks. I will confirm its details in the paper and retrieve the citation.
   
2. **Any additional datasets** that may be referenced, such as those used in related works or specific to the experiments conducted in this paper.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy access and review, ensuring that all citations are complete and accurate.
