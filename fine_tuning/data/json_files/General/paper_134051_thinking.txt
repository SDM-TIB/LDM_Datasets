To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LightLM: A Lightweight Deep and Narrow Language Model for Generative Recommendation" by Kai Mei and Yongfeng Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on "real-world datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. The introduction elaborates on the challenges of generative recommendation and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the datasets are mentioned in **section 5.1 (Experimental Settings)**. The authors specify that they conducted experiments on the following datasets:

1. **Beauty Dataset**: This dataset is sourced from Amazon.com and is used for product recommendations. The paper states that it contains 22,361 users, 12,101 items, and 198,502 interactions, with a sparsity of 99.93%.

2. **Toys Dataset**: Similar to the Beauty dataset, this dataset is also sourced from Amazon.com for product recommendations. It includes 19,412 users, 11,924 items, and 167,597 interactions, with a sparsity of 99.93%.

3. **Yelp Dataset**: This dataset provides a collection of user ratings and reviews for business recommendations. It consists of 30,431 users, 20,034 items, and 316,354 interactions, with a sparsity of 99.95%.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the references section or any relevant sources mentioned in the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Beauty Dataset**:
  > Amazon. *Beauty Dataset*. Retrieved from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/

- For the **Toys Dataset**:
  > Amazon. *Toys Dataset*. Retrieved from https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/

- For the **Yelp Dataset**:
  > Yelp. *Yelp Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I have accurately extracted all relevant datasets from the paper while providing the necessary citations for each dataset.
