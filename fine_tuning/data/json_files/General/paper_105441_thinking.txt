To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving the Diversity of Unsupervised Paraphrasing with Embedding Outputs" by Monisha Jegadeesan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on two languages using a specific corpus, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they state that they evaluate paraphrasing in English and French using the **IWSLT’16 En↔Fr corpus**. This corpus is described as having approximately 220K sentence pairs for training and 4450 sentences for evaluation.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **implementation** or **results sections**. The authors mention conducting additional experiments with a larger English-French corpus constructed from a 2M sentence-pair subset of the **WMT’10 Gigaword** and **OpenSubtitles corpora**. This indicates that there are multiple datasets involved in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **IWSLT’16 En↔Fr corpus**, the citation is:
   > Mauro Cettolo, Niehues Jan, Stüker Sebastian, Luisa Bentivogli, Roldano Cattoni, and Marcello Federico. *The IWSLT 2016 Evaluation Campaign*. In International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, 2016.

2. For the **WMT’10 Gigaword**, the citation is:
   > Jörg Tiedemann. *Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS*. In Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12), Istanbul, Turkey, 2012.

3. For the **OpenSubtitles corpus**, the citation is:
   > Pierre Lison and Jörg Tiedemann. *OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting Large Parallel Corpora from Movie and TV Subtitles*. In Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’16), 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
