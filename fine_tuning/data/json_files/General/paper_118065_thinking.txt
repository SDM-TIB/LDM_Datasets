To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mean-field neural networks: learning mappings on Wasserstein space" by HuyË†en Pham and Xavier Warin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses numerical experiments and data generation methods, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Learning mean-field functions)**, where the authors describe the data generation process. They mention generating a dataset consisting of simulated probability measures using two proposed methods. This indicates that there are specific datasets created for their experiments.

In **subsection 2.2 (Data generation)**, the authors detail two methods for generating random probability measures. They describe how to create a random grid of points and how to draw random vectors to generate bin density probability measures. However, they do not provide specific names for any publicly available datasets, as the data appears to be generated for the purpose of their experiments.

Since the paper does not reference any external datasets, I will note that the datasets used are synthetic and generated by the authors. I will also check the **References section** to see if any foundational datasets or related works are cited that might provide context or additional datasets.

After reviewing the references, I find that the paper cites several foundational works in the field, but none of them provide datasets directly related to the experiments conducted in this paper.

In conclusion, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:
1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The authors generated their own datasets for the experiments, specifically simulated probability measures.
2. **No External Datasets**: There are no publicly available datasets mentioned in the paper.

Since the datasets are synthetic and not publicly available, I will not provide citations for datasets as there are none to cite. Instead, I will document the methods used for generating the datasets as described in the paper.

This approach ensures that I accurately capture the essence of the datasets discussed in the paper, even if they are not traditional datasets that can be cited.
