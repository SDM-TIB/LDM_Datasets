To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-Level Knowledge Distillation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Text" by Qianhui Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments over multiple benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly list five datasets: **CLINC150**, **SST**, **ROSTD**, **20 NewsGroups**, and **AG News**. I will take note of the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their structure or purpose.

I will then look for the **appendix** (A.1) where the authors provide additional details about each dataset. Here, they describe the datasets as follows:

1. **CLINC150**: A crowdsourced dialog dataset introduced by Larson et al. (2019), used for intent classification and out-of-scope prediction.
2. **SST**: The Stanford Sentiment Treebank, used for sentiment analysis, as described by Socher et al. (2013).
3. **ROSTD**: A dataset released by Gangal et al. (2020) for out-of-distribution detection.
4. **20 NewsGroups**: A dataset for text classification, specifically for news articles, introduced by Lang (1995).
5. **AG News**: A topic classification dataset collected from various news sources, introduced by Zhang et al. (2015).
6. **HC3**: The Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus, introduced by Guo et al. (2023), used for distinguishing between human and AI-generated text.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations to ensure that all information is accurately captured and ready for further processing or review.
