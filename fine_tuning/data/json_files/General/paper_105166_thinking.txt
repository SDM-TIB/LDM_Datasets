To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AdamD: Improved bias-correction in Adam" by John St John, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and conclusion sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract primarily discusses the modification of the Adam optimizer and does not mention any datasets, so I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author discusses the Adam optimizer and its bias-correction terms but does not mention any datasets. I will continue to the **methodology** section, where the author describes the algorithms and their modifications. Again, there are no datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will check the **conclusion** section. The author summarizes the findings and suggests future work but does not reference any datasets. 

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets used for experiments or evaluations, I will also look at the **references section** to see if any external datasets are cited. However, the references primarily consist of papers discussing the Adam optimizer and related concepts, without specific datasets being highlighted.

After thoroughly reviewing the entire paper, it appears that there are no datasets provided or referenced in this research. Therefore, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper.

In summary, I will document my findings as follows:
- No datasets were identified in the paper "AdamD: Improved bias-correction in Adam" by John St John.
- The references do not include any datasets, only citations related to the Adam optimizer and its variants.

Since there are no datasets to cite, I will not create any dataset entries or citations.
