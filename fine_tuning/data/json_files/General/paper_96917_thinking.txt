To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Future-Guided Incremental Transformer for Simultaneous Translation" by Shaolei Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions conducting experiments on Chinese-English and German-English simultaneous translation tasks, indicating that datasets are likely involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they specify:

1. **Chinese → English Dataset**: The training set consists of about 1.25 million sentence pairs from LDC corpora, with specific validation and test sets mentioned (MT02 for validation and MT03, MT04, MT05, MT06, MT08 for testing).

2. **German → English Dataset**: The training set consists of about 4.5 million sentence pairs from the WMT15 De-En task, with news-test2013 as the validation set and news-test2015 as the test set.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Chinese → English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, Hansards portion of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08, and LDC2005T06. *Linguistic Data Consortium*.

- For the **German → English Dataset**, the citation is:
  > WMT15. *Proceedings of the Tenth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. URL: http://www.statmt.org/wmt15/translation-task.html.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or analysis.
