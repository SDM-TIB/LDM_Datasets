To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RM-Depth: Unsupervised Learning of Recurrent Monocular Depth in Dynamic Scenes" by Tak-Wai Hui, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that RM-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results on the **KITTI** and **Cityscapes** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the provided text, the **dataset** section is explicitly mentioned in section 4.1, where it states that the system is trained and validated on **KITTI** and **Cityscapes**. This confirms that these two datasets are indeed utilized in the experiments.

Now, I will gather detailed information about each dataset:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: The paper references the KITTI dataset, which is widely used for various computer vision tasks, including depth estimation. The citation for the KITTI dataset is:
   > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. In International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), 32(1):1231–1237, 2013.

2. **Cityscapes Dataset**: The Cityscapes dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method. The citation for the Cityscapes dataset is:
   > Mario Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sergio Ramos, Thomas Rehfeld, Martin Enzweiler, Rainer Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes dataset for semantic urban scene understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 3213–3223, 2016.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I have the correct format for each dataset entry, including the dataset name, description, and full citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that can be used for further processing or review, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
