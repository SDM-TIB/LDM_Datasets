To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Characterizing the Influence of Graph Elements" by Zizhang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of their methods in various real-world scenarios, which may hint at the datasets they utilized. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, characteristics, and how they were employed in the experiments. 

In this paper, the authors mention using **six real-world graph datasets**: Cora, PubMed, CiteSeer, WiKi-CS, Amazon Computers, and Amazon Photos. I will extract the relevant details for each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, classes, features, and the train/validation/test splits.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Cora Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, B., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

2. **CiteSeer Dataset**:
   > Sen, P., Namata, B., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, J., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-106.

3. **PubMed Dataset**:

4. **WiKi-CS Dataset**:
   > Mernyei, P., & Cangea, C. (2020). Wiki-CS: A Wikipedia-based benchmark for graph neural networks. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.02901*.

5. **Amazon Computers Dataset**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2018*.

6. **Amazon Photos Dataset**:
   > Shchur, O., Mumme, M., Bojchevski, A., & Günnemann, S. (2018). Pitfalls of graph neural network evaluation. *Relational Representation Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2018*.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while providing proper attribution.
