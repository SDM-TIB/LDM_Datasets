To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Does Robustness on ImageNet Transfer to Downstream Tasks?" by Yutaro Yamada and Mayu Otani, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions the use of ImageNet pretrained backbones for downstream tasks, which suggests that ImageNet is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **Background and Dataset sections** to find specific datasets used in the experiments. In the paper, the authors mention two primary datasets for their experiments:

1. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is used for object detection tasks. The authors specify that they utilize the COCO 2017 validation set for testing, which is a standard practice in the field.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is used for semantic segmentation tasks. The authors describe it as consisting of 20,210 training images and 2,000 validation images, with 150 semantic classes.

I will also check the **References section** to ensure I have the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and Larry Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene Parsing through ADE20K Dataset*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5122â€“5130, 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
