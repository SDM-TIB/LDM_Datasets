To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conformer: Embedding Continuous Attention in Vision Transformer for Weather Forecasting" by Hira Saleem et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model against a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning-based weather forecasting models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look closely at **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, they specifically mention using the **WeatherBench** dataset to download the **ERA5** dataset provided by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). This is a clear indication of the datasets utilized in their research.

In **section 5.1**, the authors provide details about the ERA5 dataset, describing it as a weather reanalysis dataset with hourly intervals that includes various parameters related to land, ocean, and atmosphere. They also mention that the dataset has the highest resolution of 0.25° × 0.25° and has been collected since 1940.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the ERA5 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **ERA5 Dataset**:
  > Hersbach, H., Bell, B., Berrisford, P., Biavati, G., Horányi, A., Muñoz Sabater, J., Nicolas, J., Peubey, C., Radu, R., Rozum, I., et al. *ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1959 to present [dataset]*. Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Data Store (CDS), 2018.

Additionally, the authors reference the WeatherBench benchmark dataset, which is also important to note. The citation for WeatherBench is:

- **WeatherBench**:
  > Rasp, S., Dueben, P. D., Scher, S., Weyn, J. A., Mouatadid, S., and Thuerey, N. *WeatherBench: A benchmark data set for data-driven weather forecasting*. Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems, 12(11): e2020MS002203, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
