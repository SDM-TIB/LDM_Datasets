To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of the Use of Color and Its Emotional Relationship in Visual Creations Based on Experiences During the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic," I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and mentions the use of the **COVID Art Museum (CAM)** dataset, which is a significant clue that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe their approach to analyzing the CAM dataset. They mention that they extracted 1,537 images from the CAM, which is crucial information for identifying the dataset.

In **Table 1**, the authors list several datasets used in their research, including:

1. **ArtPhoto Dataset**: This dataset is referenced with the citation:

2. **MART Dataset**: This dataset is cited as:

3. **devArt Dataset**: This dataset is also from:

4. **WikiArt Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is:
   > Saleh, B., & Elgammal, A. (2015). Large-scale Classification of Fine-Art Paintings: Learning The Right Metric on The Right Feature. arXiv:1505.00855. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00855.

5. **ArtEmis Dataset**: This dataset is referenced with:
   > Achlioptas, P., Ovsjanikov, M., Haydarov, K., Elhoseiny, M., & Guibas, L. (2021). ArtEmis: Affective Language for Visual Art. arXiv:2101.07396. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07396.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their respective citations accurately, as they are essential for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that highlights the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
