To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Recent Trends in Face Recognition Systems" by K. S. Krishnendu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and conclusion sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract discusses advancements in face recognition technology but does not specify any datasets. Therefore, I will move on to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the author mentions the importance of image datasets for establishing a person's identity but does not name any specific datasets. I will continue to the **methods section**, where the author describes various face recognition systems and algorithms.

In the **methods section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The author discusses several methods (RPRV, LWKPCA, etc.) but does not provide specific dataset names. I will check the **discussion and conclusion sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments or evaluations.

Upon reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the author does not explicitly mention any specific datasets by name. However, the paper references various studies and methods that may have utilized datasets, but these are not detailed in this particular work.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to identify any studies that may have used datasets relevant to the topic of face recognition. I will look for papers that are likely to have datasets associated with them.

For example, I find the following references that may be relevant:

1. **Kottakkal Sugathan's PhD thesis** discusses demographic effects on face recognition accuracy, which may imply the use of datasets related to demographic variations.
   - Citation: K. Kottakkal Sugathan, Characterizing the Demographic Effects Relative to Race, Gender, and Skin Tone on the Accuracy of Deep Convolutional Neural Network Based Face Recognition Systems. PhD thesis, 2021.

2. **The paper by Krishnapriya et al.** discusses face recognition accuracy varying based on race and skin tone, which likely involves datasets that include diverse demographic groups.
   - Citation: K. Krishnapriya, V. Albiero, K. Vangara, M. C. King, and K. W. Bowyer, “Issues related to face recognition accuracy varying based on race and skin tone,” IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 8–20, 2020.

3. **The paper by Albiero et al.** analyzes gender inequality in face recognition accuracy, which may also involve specific datasets.
   - Citation: V. Albiero, K. Ks, K. Vangara, K. Zhang, M. C. King, and K. W. Bowyer, “Analysis of gender inequality in face recognition accuracy,” in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops, pp. 81–89, 2020.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names, I will summarize the findings and note that while specific datasets are not mentioned, the references may lead to relevant datasets used in related studies.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include full citations for any datasets or related studies referenced in the paper.
