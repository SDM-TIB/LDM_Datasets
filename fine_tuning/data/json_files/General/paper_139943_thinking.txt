To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MathScale: Scaling Instruction Tuning for Mathematical Reasoning" by Zhengyang Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset called **MathScaleQA** containing two million math question-answer pairs and also constructed **MWPBENCH**, a benchmark of Math Word Problems that includes several datasets.

Next, I will look into **section 2 (MWPBENCH Evaluation Framework)**, where the authors list existing datasets used in their evaluation. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **GSM8K**: A dataset focused on elementary-level math problems.
2. **MATH**: A dataset that presents competition-level math challenges.
3. **TAL-SCQ**: A dataset consisting of multiple-choice questions.
4. **Math23k**: A dataset containing math problems originally in Chinese.
5. **Ape210k**: A large-scale dataset of math word problems.
6. **GaokaoBench-Math**: A dataset related to the Chinese college entrance exam.
7. **AGIEval**: A series of datasets for evaluating mathematical reasoning.

In **section 2.1**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset, which will help in understanding their characteristics and purposes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will include the authors, title, publication venue, and year of publication.

For example, the citations I will need to extract include:

- **GSM8K**:

- **MATH**:

  > Zhao, W., Shang, M., Liu, Y., Wang, L., and Liu, J. *Ape210k: A large-scale and template-rich dataset of math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.11506, 2020.

- **GaokaoBench-Math**: 
  > Zhang, X., Li, C., Zong, Y., Ying, Z., He, L., and Qiu, X. *Evaluating the performance of large language models on gaokao benchmark*. 2023.

- **AGIEval**:

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets from the paper while providing proper attribution.
