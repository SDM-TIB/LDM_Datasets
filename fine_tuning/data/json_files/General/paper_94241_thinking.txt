To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pruning Neural Networks at Initialization: Why Are We Missing the Mark?" by Jonathan Frankle et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their research and may mention specific datasets that are relevant to their work. I will take note of any datasets that are cited or described.

In the **methods section**, I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets used in the experiments. This section typically provides detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. For example, the authors may mention datasets like CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet, or ImageNet, along with any specific configurations or modifications they made.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **results section** to confirm that the datasets mentioned were indeed used in the experiments and to see if there are any additional details provided about their usage.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
