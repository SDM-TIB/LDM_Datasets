To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLAMAS KNOW WHAT GPTS DONâ€™T SHOW: SURROGATE MODELS FOR CONFIDENCE ESTIMATION" by Vaishnavi Shrivastava, Percy Liang, and Ananya Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the research, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention evaluating their method on **12 question-answering datasets**. This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, and I need to find their specific names and details.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methods or experiments sections**. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **setup section**. They mention the following datasets:

1. **TruthfulQA (TQA)**: A benchmark designed to test the truthfulness of large language models across various categories.
2. **CommonsenseQA (CSQA)**: A multiple-choice benchmark testing commonsense reasoning.
3. **OpenbookQA (OBQA)**: A dataset requiring multi-step reasoning over common and commonsense knowledge.
4. **MedQA**: A dataset testing medical knowledge based on USMLE and other medical board exams.
5. **MMLU**: A massive benchmark covering 57 subjects from diverse areas, testing both rudimentary and advanced knowledge.

The authors also mention that they sampled 250 questions from the test split of each dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **TruthfulQA**: 
  > Lin, S., Hilton, J., & Evans, O. (2021). *TruthfulQA: Measuring how models mimic human falsehoods*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.07958.

- **CommonsenseQA**: 
  > Talmor, A., Herzig, J., Lourie, N., & Berant, J. (2019). *CommonsenseQA: A question answering challenge targeting commonsense knowledge*. In Proceedings of the North American Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL).

- **OpenbookQA**: 
  > Mihaylov, T., Clark, P., Khot, T., & Sabharwal, A. (2018). *Can a suit of armor conduct electricity? A new dataset for open book question answering*. In Proceedings of the Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).

- **MedQA**: 
  > Jin, D., Pan, E., Oufattole, N., Weng, W.-H., Fang, H., & Szolovits, P. (2021). *What disease does this patient have? A large-scale open domain question answering dataset from medical exams*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.13081.

- **MMLU**: 
  > Hendrycks, D., Burns, C., Basart, S., Zou, A., Mazeika, M., Song, D., & Steinhardt, J. (2021). *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
