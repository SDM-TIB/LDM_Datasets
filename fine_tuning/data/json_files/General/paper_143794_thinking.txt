To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing Active Learning for Sentinel 2 Imagery through Contrastive Learning and Uncertainty Estimation" by D. Pogorzelski, P. Arlinghaus, and W. Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimentation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors focus on **Sentinel-2 imagery analyzed using the Eurosat dataset**, which suggests that the Eurosat dataset is a key dataset used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at the **experimentation section** where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention using the **Eurosat dataset**, which consists of 27,000 Sentinel-2 image patches, each sized 64x64x13, and categorized into 10 classes. This section provides specific details about the dataset, confirming its relevance to their experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the Eurosat dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> P. Helber, B. Bischke, A. Dengel, and D. Borth. *Eurosat: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification*. IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, vol. 12, no. 7, pp. 2217-2226, 2019.

Since the paper does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus solely on the Eurosat dataset for my extraction.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Eurosat dataset as it is crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or application.
