To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dropout is a special case of the stochastic delta rule: faster and more accurate deep learning" by Noah Frazier-Logue and Stephen JosÃ© Hanson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed method on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **implementation and results sections** where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used for testing their models. In the results section, they mention performance benchmarks on **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets, which are commonly used in deep learning research.

I will then look for any explicit descriptions or references to these datasets in the **implementation section**. The authors state that they used a modified DenseNet model trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, confirming that these are the datasets utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The CIFAR datasets are well-known, and their citations are typically included in the literature. The citations I will use are:

- For **CIFAR-10**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: The CIFAR-10 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

- For **CIFAR-100**:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-100: The CIFAR-100 dataset of images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation for each dataset.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that they are ready for review or further processing.
