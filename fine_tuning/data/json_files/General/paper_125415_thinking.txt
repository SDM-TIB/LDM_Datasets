To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LLM-based Interaction for Content Generation: A Case Study on the Perception of Employees in an IT department" by Alexandre Agossah et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and discussion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study is based on a **questionnaire survey**, which suggests that there may be a dataset derived from survey responses.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors describe the development of a customized questionnaire to explore the perception of generative tools among employees. This section may provide insights into the dataset, including the number of respondents and the types of questions asked.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings based on the survey responses, including the number of participants and their familiarity with generative tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. This section is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and the specific data points collected.

I will also check the **discussion section** for any additional insights or clarifications regarding the dataset, such as how the data was analyzed or any limitations that might affect the interpretation of the results.

After gathering information about the dataset, I will look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the methodology or tools used in the study. However, since the dataset is derived from the authors' own survey, there may not be an external citation for it.

The key dataset I will extract is:

1. **Survey Dataset**: This dataset includes responses from 19 employees regarding their perceptions of generative tools in the workplace. The survey covers various factors influencing the acceptability of these tools, such as perceived usefulness, ease of use, and frequency of use.

Since the dataset is based on the authors' original research, I will cite the paper itself as the source of the dataset:

- Agossah, A., Krupa, F., Perreira Da Silva, M., & Le Callet, P. (2023). LLM-based Interaction for Content Generation: A Case Study on the Perception of Employees in an IT department. *ACM IMXâ€™23 Interactive Media Experience*. 

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset and its citation.
