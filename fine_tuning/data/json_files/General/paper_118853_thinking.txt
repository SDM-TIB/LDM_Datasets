To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Tale of Two Graphs: Freezing and Denoising Graph Structures for Multimodal Recommendation" by Xin Zhou and Zhiqi Shen, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on three real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors mention using three categories of the Amazon review dataset: **Baby**, **Sports**, and **Clothing**. This is a clear indication that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

I will then check the **experiments section** for more details about these datasets. The authors provide a table (Table 3) that outlines the statistics of the datasets, including the number of users, items, interactions, and sparsity for each dataset. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets. Since the datasets are derived from the Amazon review dataset, I will look for the original source of this dataset. The citation for the Amazon review dataset is typically attributed to:

> He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 507-517.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

1. **Baby Dataset**: A subset of the Amazon review dataset focused on baby products, containing user interactions and multimodal features.
   - Citation: He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 507-517.

2. **Sports Dataset**: A subset of the Amazon review dataset focused on sports and outdoor products, containing user interactions and multimodal features.
   - Citation: He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 507-517.

3. **Clothing Dataset**: A subset of the Amazon review dataset focused on clothing, shoes, and jewelry, containing user interactions and multimodal features.
   - Citation: He, R., & McAuley, J. (2016). Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW), 507-517.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
