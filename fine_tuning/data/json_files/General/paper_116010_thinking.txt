To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Uncertainty Aware Multitask Pyramid Vision Transformer for UAV-Based Object Re-Identification" by Syeda Nyma Ferdous, Xin Li, and Siwei Lyu, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that experimental results are reported on **PRAI and VRAI**, which indicates that these are the datasets used in their research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets:

1. **PRAI-1581 Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 39,461 person images across 1581 classes, captured by two UAV drones at altitudes ranging from 20 to 60 meters. This dataset is specifically designed for person re-identification in aerial imagery.

2. **VRAI Dataset**: This dataset consists of approximately 137,613 images of 13,022 vehicles, also captured by UAV drones. The authors note that this is the largest UAV-based vehicle dataset to date.

In the **implementation details**, the authors provide further information about the training and testing splits for both datasets, confirming their usage in the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **PRAI-1581 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shizhou Zhang, Qi Zhang, Yifei Yang, Xing Wei, Peng Wang, Bingliang Jiao, and Yanning Zhang. *Person re-identification in aerial imagery*. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 23, pp. 281–291, 2020.

- For the **VRAI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Peng Wang, Bingliang Jiao, Lu Yang, Yifei Yang, Shizhou Zhang, Wei Wei, and Yanning Zhang. *Vehicle re-identification in aerial imagery: Dataset and approach*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision and Visual Media (ICVV), pp. 460–469, 2019.

Having gathered all the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
