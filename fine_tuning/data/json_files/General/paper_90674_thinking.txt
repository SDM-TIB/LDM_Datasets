To extract datasets from the research paper titled "XtremeDistil: Multi-stage Distillation for Massive Multilingual Models" by Subhabrata Mukherjee and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of their method on multilingual Named Entity Recognition (NER) and mentions performance over 41 languages, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **WikiAnn-41**: This dataset is used for multilingual NER and is derived from the WikiAnn NER corpus. It is partitioned into training, development, and test sets, and includes 11 tags for entities.

2. **IMDB**: A dataset for sentiment analysis, containing movie reviews.

3. **DBPedia**: A dataset for topic classification of Wikipedia articles.

4. **AG News**: A dataset for topic classification of news articles.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide a summary of these datasets, including the number of labels, training, testing, and unlabeled instances. This table is crucial for extracting specific details about each dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **WikiAnn**, the citation is:

- For **IMDB**, the citation is:

- For **DBPedia**, the citation is:

- For **AG News**, the citation is:
  > Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling. *Semi-supervised classification with graph convolutional networks*. In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), Toulon, France, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset.
