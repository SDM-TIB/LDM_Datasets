To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Superhuman Accuracy on the SNEMI3D Connectomics Challenge" by Kisuk Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the SNEMI3D benchmark challenge, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **SNEMI3D Dataset**: This dataset is described as a single labeled image stack of size 1024 × 1024 × 100 for training and testing, with a voxel resolution of 6 × 6 × 29 nm³. This dataset is central to their experiments and results.

The authors also refer to another dataset in the same section:

2. **AC3 Dataset**: This dataset is described as a labeled image stack of size 1024 × 1024 × 256, which was made publicly available along with the publication of Kasthuri et al. This dataset is used for post-challenge analyses.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **SNEMI3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > H. Sebastian Seung, et al. *The SNEMI3D Challenge: A Benchmark for Neuronal Reconstruction from Electron Microscopy*. In Proceedings of the 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.

- For the **AC3 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Narayanan Kasthuri, et al. *Saturated Reconstruction of a Volume of Neocortex*. Cell, 162(3):342–351, 2015.

Having gathered this information, I will now prepare to create structured entries for each dataset, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This will involve compiling the dataset names, descriptions, and citations into a clear format for further processing.
