To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Manifold GPLVMs for discovering non-Euclidean latent structure in neural data" by Kristopher T. Jensen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on **synthetic datasets** and **calcium recordings from Drosophila melanogaster** and **extracellular recordings from the mouse anterodorsal thalamic nucleus**. This suggests that there are specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their validation process. In **Section 3.1**, they mention using **synthetic datasets** generated on T1, T2, and SO(3) for testing their model. However, these datasets are synthetic and may not have formal citations. 

In **Section 3.2**, they discuss applying their model to **calcium imaging data recorded from the ellipsoid body of Drosophila melanogaster**. The authors reference a specific dataset from Turner-Evans et al. (2020) for this data. I will need to extract the full citation for this dataset.

Additionally, they mention using **extracellular recordings from the mouse anterodorsal thalamic nucleus**, which is referenced as a dataset from Peyrache et al. (2015). I will also need to extract the full citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. For the **Drosophila melanogaster calcium imaging dataset**, the citation is:
   > Turner-Evans, D. B., Jensen, K. T., Ali, S., Paterson, T., Sheridan, A., Ray, R. P., Wolff, T., Lauritzen, J. S., Rubin, G. M., Bock, D. D., and Jayaraman, V. (2020). The neuroanatomical ultrastructure and function of a biological ring attractor. *Neuron*, 108:145–163. DOI: https://doi.org/10.25378/janelia.12490325.v1.

2. For the **mouse anterodorsal thalamic nucleus dataset**, the citation is:
   > Peyrache, A., Petersen, P., and Buzsáki, G. (2015). Extracellular recordings from multi-site silicon probes in the anterior thalamus and subicular formation of freely moving mice. *CRCNS.org*. Dataset. DOI: https://doi.org/10.6080/K0G15XS1.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations as required.
