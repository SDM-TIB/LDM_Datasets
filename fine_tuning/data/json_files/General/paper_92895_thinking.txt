To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Journey Towards Tiny Perceptual Super-Resolution" by Royson Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed models on various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors mention that their models were tested on commonly-used SR benchmarks, specifically the **DIV2K dataset** and several others. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors detail their training and validation processes, stating that they used **800 images for training and 100 images for validation from the DIV2K dataset**. This confirms the use of the DIV2K dataset for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the DIV2K dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Timofte, R., et al. "NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Methods and Results." In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), 2017.

Additionally, the authors mention testing on other benchmarks like **Set5, Set14, B100, and Urban100**. I will also look for citations for these datasets in the references section.

The citations for these datasets are:
- **Set5**: Bevilacqua, M., Roumy, A., Guillemot, C., and Alberi Morel, M. "Low-Complexity Single-Image Super-Resolution based on Nonnegative Neighbor Embedding." In: British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2012.
- **Set14**: Zeyde, R., Elad, M., and Protter, M. "On Single Image Scale-Up Using Sparse-Representations." In: 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.
- **B100**: Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., and Malik, J. "A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics." In: IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2001.
- **Urban100**: Huang, J., Singh, A., and Ahuja, N. "Single image super-resolution from transformed self-exemplars." In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2015.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
