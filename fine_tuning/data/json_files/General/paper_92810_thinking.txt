To extract datasets from the research paper titled "STADB: A Self-Thresholding Attention Guided ADB Network for Person Re-identification" by Bo Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed STADB outperforms many other related methods for person re-ID." This indicates that multiple datasets are used, prompting me to look for their names.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention four widely used short-term person re-ID benchmark datasets:

1. **Market-1501**: A large-scale dataset for person re-identification, containing 32,668 annotated images of 1,501 identities captured from 6 cameras.
2. **DukeMTMC**: A dataset that includes 36,411 images of 1,404 identities, collected from 8 cameras, with a focus on multi-target tracking.
3. **CUHK03**: This dataset consists of 14,097 images of 1,467 identities, with both labeled and detected versions available.
4. **MSMT17**: A dataset with 126,441 images of 4,101 identities, designed for long-term person re-identification scenarios.

Additionally, they mention the **Celeb-reID** dataset, which is used to validate the effectiveness of their approach for long-term cloth-changing re-ID scenarios.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **Market-1501**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
