To extract datasets from the research paper titled "It’s Morphin’ Time! Combating Linguistic Discrimination with Inﬂectional Perturbations" by Samson Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the creation of adversarial examples to expose biases in NLP models, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. The introduction elaborates on the focus of the research, hinting at the use of specific datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on various NLP tasks, which typically require specific datasets. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize results, as they often include dataset names.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention two primary datasets:

1. **SQuAD 2.0**: This dataset is used for extractive question answering and includes both answerable and unanswerable questions. The authors state that they evaluate their models on this dataset, which is crucial for understanding the performance of their adversarial examples.

2. **WMT’14 English-French**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks. The authors mention using this dataset to evaluate the performance of their models on translation tasks, indicating its significance in their experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For **SQuAD 2.0**, the citation is:
  > Pranav Rajpurkar, Robin Jia, and Percy Liang. *Know what you don’t know: Unanswerable questions for SQuAD*. In Proceedings of the 56th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 784–789, Melbourne, Australia, 2018.

- For **WMT’14 English-French**, the citation is:
  > Rico Sennrich, Barry Haddow, and Alexandra Birch. *Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units*. In Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 1715–1725, Berlin, Germany, 2016.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to the importance of proper citation.
