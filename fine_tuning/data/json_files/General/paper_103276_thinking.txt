To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Person Search: An Anchor-Free Approach" by Yichao Yan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention two specific datasets:

1. **CUHK-SYSU**: This dataset is described as a large-scale person search dataset containing 18,184 images with 8,432 different identities and 96,143 annotated bounding boxes. The dataset includes images from various sources, such as real street snaps and movies, covering diverse scenes.

2. **PRW**: This dataset consists of images captured from surveillance videos, totaling 11,816 frames with 932 labeled persons and 43,110 bounding boxes. The dataset is split into training and test sets, with specific numbers of images and identities mentioned.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CUHK-SYSU**, the citation is:
  > L. Zheng, H. Zhang, S. Sun, M. Chandraker, Y. Yang, and Q. Tian. "Person re-identification in the wild." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 3346–3355.

- For **PRW**, the citation is:
  > T. Xiao, S. Li, B. Wang, L. Lin, and X. Wang. "Joint detection and identification feature learning for person search." In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017, pp. 3376–3385.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
