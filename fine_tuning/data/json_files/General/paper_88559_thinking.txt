To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Very Long Natural Scenery Image Prediction by Outpainting" by Zongxin Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the collection of a "new scenery dataset with diverse, complicated natural scenes," which indicates that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors describe the challenges of image outpainting and the need for a dataset to test their proposed architecture. They state that they collected a new scenery dataset consisting of 6,000 images, which includes various natural scenes such as mountains, valleys, and starry skies. This provides a clear indication of the dataset's purpose and content.

In the **experiments section**, the authors elaborate on the dataset, mentioning that it contains about 5,000 images in the training set and 1,000 images in the testing set. They also note that part of the dataset (approximately 3,000 images) comes from the SUN dataset, while the rest were collected from the internet. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition and origin.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SUN dataset, as it is mentioned as a source for part of their dataset. The citation for the SUN dataset is:
> Jianxiong Xiao, James Hays, Krista A Ehinger, Aude Oliva, and Antonio Torralba. *SUN Database: Large-Scale Scene Recognition from Abbey to Zoo*. In 2010 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3485â€“3492, 2010.

The authors do not provide a specific citation for their newly collected scenery dataset, but I will document it as follows:
- **Scenery Dataset**: A new dataset collected by the authors, consisting of 6,000 images of diverse natural scenes, including mountains, valleys, and starry skies. The dataset is available from their GitHub repository.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that all relevant information is captured and properly attributed.
