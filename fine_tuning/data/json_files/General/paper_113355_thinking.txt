To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of High-Performance Computing and Parallel Techniques Applied to Power Systems Optimization" by Ahmed Al-Shafei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and conclusion** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often summarizes the key findings and may reference datasets used in the study. The introduction typically provides context and may mention specific datasets relevant to the research.

Next, I will examine the **methodology and results sections** closely. These sections often contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, size, and the specific applications they were used for in the study. I will look for any tables or figures that summarize dataset information, as these can provide concise details.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. If the datasets are derived from previous studies, I will ensure to note the original sources and their citations.

As I identify datasets, I will take note of the following details for each one:
1. **Dataset Name**: The official name of the dataset as mentioned in the paper.
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and key features.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extracted information is organized and easily accessible for future reference.

Finally, I will review the entire paper to ensure that I have not missed any datasets and that the citations are accurate and complete. This thorough approach will help me extract all relevant datasets from the research paper effectively.
