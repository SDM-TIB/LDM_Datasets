To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Comprehensive System for Secondary Structure Analysis of Protein Models" by Vedh Ramalingam Kannan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and data availability sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the software's capabilities but does not explicitly mention datasets. However, the introduction provides context about the Ramachandran plot and its importance in protein structure analysis, which may hint at the types of data used.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the **Data Preprocessing** subsection. Here, the author mentions that the raw data consists of protein models in the *.pdb file format. This indicates that the datasets used for analysis are protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The author also describes how the software generates a *.tsv file from these PDB files, which is crucial for the analysis.

In the **data availability section**, the author confirms that all protein models used for testing were sourced from the Protein Data Bank or created using AlphaFold. This reinforces the idea that the datasets are primarily derived from these two sources.

Now, I will look for the full citations of the datasets mentioned. The references to the Protein Data Bank and AlphaFold are essential:

1. **Protein Data Bank (PDB)**: The citation for the PDB is:
   > H. M. Berman, J. Westbrook, Z. Feng, G. Gilliland, T. N. Bhat, H. Weissig, I. N. Shindyalov, and P. E. Bourne. *The protein data bank*. Nucleic Acids Research, 28:235–242, 2000.

2. **AlphaFold**: The citation for AlphaFold is:
   > J. Jumper, R. Evans, A. Pritzel, and et al. *Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold*. Nature, 596:583–589, 2021.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- The primary dataset is the **Protein Data Bank**, which provides a vast collection of protein structures in PDB format.
- The secondary dataset is generated using **AlphaFold**, which creates protein models based on AI predictions.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly identifies each dataset along with its full citation, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference or analysis.
