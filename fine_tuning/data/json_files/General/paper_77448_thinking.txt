To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Anatomical Data Augmentation for CNN Based Pixel-Wise Classification" by Avi Ben-Cohen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the dataset consists of CT examinations from 140 patients with 333 annotated CT images. This suggests that there is a specific dataset being used for the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 3.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they mention that the dataset includes CT scans from the Sheba Medical Center, with a total of 333 CT slices annotated by an expert radiologist. They also specify the breakdown of the dataset into training and testing sets, which is crucial for understanding how the data is utilized.

In this section, I will note the following details:
- The dataset consists of CT images from 140 patients.
- It includes annotations for different classes: metastasis, hemangioma, cyst, and healthy liver tissue.
- The training set contains 225 images, while the testing set has 108 images.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is derived from CT scans at the Sheba Medical Center, I will look for any relevant publications or reports that describe this dataset in detail. However, the paper does not provide a specific citation for the dataset itself, as it is likely an internal dataset used by the authors.

Given that the dataset is not publicly available or cited in a formal publication, I will note that the dataset is based on CT scans from the Sheba Medical Center, but I will not be able to provide a formal citation for it.

Finally, I will summarize the findings regarding the dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Sheba Medical Center CT Dataset
- **Description**: A dataset consisting of CT examinations from 140 patients, including 333 annotated CT images for liver lesion classification.
- **Classes**: Metastasis, hemangioma, cyst, and healthy liver tissue.
- **Training Set Size**: 225 images
- **Testing Set Size**: 108 images

Since there is no formal citation for the dataset, I will note that it is based on internal data from the Sheba Medical Center without a specific reference.

After gathering all this information, I will compile it into a structured format for further use or processing.
