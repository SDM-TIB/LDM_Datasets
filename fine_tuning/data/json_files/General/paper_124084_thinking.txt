To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning A Sparse Transformer Network for Effective Image Deraining" by Xiang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of the proposed method on commonly used benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they list several datasets:

1. **Rain200L**: This dataset contains 1,800 synthetic rainy images for training and 200 for testing. It is commonly used for evaluating image deraining methods.

2. **Rain200H**: Similar to Rain200L, this dataset also consists of 1,800 synthetic rainy images for training and 200 for testing, but with higher rain intensity.

3. **DID-Data**: This dataset includes 12,000 synthetic images with varying rain directions and densities, along with 1,200 rainy images for testing.

4. **DDN-Data**: This dataset consists of 12,600 synthetic images with different rain characteristics and includes 1,400 rainy images for testing.

5. **SPA-Data**: A large-scale real-world dataset containing 638,492 image pairs for training and 1,000 for testing, specifically designed for evaluating deraining methods in real-world scenarios.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **Rain200L** and **Rain200H**, the citation is:

- For **DID-Data**, the citation is:

- For **DDN-Data**, the citation is:
  > Xueyang Fu, Qi Qi, Zheng-Jun Zha, Yurui Zhu, and Xinghao Ding. *Rain streak removal via dual graph convolutional network*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, pages 1352–1360, 2021.

- For **SPA-Data**, the citation is:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
