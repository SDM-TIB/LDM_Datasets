To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attention-based Class Activation Diffusion for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation" by Jianqiang Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on two benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5) where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they state that they used two commonly used datasets: **PASCAL VOC 2012** and **MS COCO 2014**.

1. **PASCAL VOC 2012**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 20 foreground object classes and 1 background class, with specific sample counts for training, validation, and testing. This dataset is widely recognized in the field of computer vision.

2. **MS COCO 2014**: This dataset is noted for having 80 object classes and 1 background class, with a larger number of samples compared to PASCAL VOC. The authors mention that it is more challenging due to its multi-label nature.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PASCAL VOC 2012**, the citation is:
  > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303-338.

- For **MS COCO 2014**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 740-755.

Now that I have the dataset names and their full citations, I will prepare to compile this information into a structured output format for further use.
