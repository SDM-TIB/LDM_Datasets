To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DeepOHeat: Operator Learning-based Ultra-fast Thermal Simulation in 3D-IC Design" by Ziyue Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the DeepOHeat framework and its application to thermal simulations, but it does not specify any datasets directly.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where datasets are typically described. In this section, the authors mention testing DeepOHeat on "some industrial design cases" and comparing it against Celsius 3D from Cadence Design Systems. However, they do not provide specific names or citations for any datasets used in their experiments.

Since the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide references to them, I will look for any references to datasets in the **background or related work sections**. These sections often provide context and may reference datasets used in previous studies. However, in this case, the authors primarily discuss existing thermal simulation methods and do not cite specific datasets.

I will also check the **References section** for any papers that might describe datasets relevant to the work presented in this paper. However, the references primarily focus on methodologies and do not provide specific datasets.

Given that the paper does not explicitly mention any datasets or provide citations for them, I will conclude that there are no datasets to extract from this paper. 

If there were datasets mentioned, I would have followed these steps:
1. Identify the dataset names and descriptions in the relevant sections.
2. Look for full citations in the References section for each dataset.
3. Document each dataset with its name, description, and citation.

Since there are no datasets to extract in this case, I will summarize my findings accordingly.
