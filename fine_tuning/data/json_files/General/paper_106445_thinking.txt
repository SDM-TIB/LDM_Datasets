To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MDFM: Multi-Decision Fusing Model for Few-Shot Learning" by Shuai Shao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on **five benchmark datasets**, which indicates that there are specific datasets to look for.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of few-shot learning and mention that they will evaluate their method on various datasets. This reinforces the idea that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they specifically mention the following datasets:

1. **mini-ImageNet**: A subset of the ImageNet dataset, consisting of 100 classes with 600 images per class, used for few-shot learning tasks.

2. **tiered-ImageNet**: Another subset of ImageNet, containing 608 classes, which is divided into base, validation, and novel sets for few-shot learning.

3. **CIFAR-FS**: A few-shot learning dataset derived from CIFAR-100, consisting of 100 classes, with a standard split into base, validation, and novel sets.

4. **FC100**: A subset of CIFAR-100, which is also used for few-shot learning, with a similar structure to CIFAR-FS.

5. **CUB (Caltech-UCSD Birds 200)**: A dataset containing 11,788 images across 200 categories, used for evaluating few-shot learning methods.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Vinyals, O., Blundell, C., Lillicrap, T., & Wierstra, D. (2016). Matching networks for one shot learning. In Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS).

- For **tiered-ImageNet**, the citation is:

- For **CIFAR-FS**, the citation is:

- For **FC100**, the citation is:

- For **CUB**, the citation is:
  > Wah, C., Branson, S., Welinder, P., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2011). The Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset. 

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
