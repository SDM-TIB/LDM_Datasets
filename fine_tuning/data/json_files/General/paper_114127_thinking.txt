To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arbitrary Style Transfer with Structure Enhancement by Combining the Global and Local Loss" by Lizhen Long and Chi-Man Pun, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the method is evaluated on "several common datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental results section (Section 4)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Settings)**, where the authors explicitly state the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **MS-COCO**: This dataset is used for content images and contains roughly 80,000 training images.
2. **WikiArt**: This dataset is used for style images and also contains approximately 80,000 training images.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **MS-COCO**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., & Zitnick, C.L. (2014). Microsoft coco: Common objects in context. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*, pp. 740–755. Springer.

- For **WikiArt**, the citation is:
  > Phillips, F., & Mackintosh, B. (2011). Wiki art gallery, inc.: A case for critical thinking. *Issues in Accounting Education*, 26(3), 593–608.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will prepare to create structured entries for each dataset according to the specified format.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
1. **MS-COCO**: Used for content images.
2. **WikiArt**: Used for style images.

I will ensure to include the full citations for both datasets in the final output.
