To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lost in Translation, Found in Spans: Identifying Claims in Multilingual Social Media" by Shubham Mittal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a novel dataset called **X-CLAIM**, which consists of 7K real-world claims collected from various social media platforms in multiple languages. This indicates that a dataset is explicitly defined.

Next, I will focus on the **dataset section (Section 3)**, where the authors describe their methodology for creating the X-CLAIM dataset. They outline a two-step process involving data collection from fact-checking websites and automated annotation of claim spans. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including the languages covered (English, Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali) and the number of claims collected from each language.

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics about the X-CLAIM dataset, including the number of samples in the training, development, and test splits for each language. This reinforces the significance of the dataset and its structure.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the X-CLAIM dataset. The authors mention that they release the dataset and code on GitHub, which is a crucial detail for citation purposes. The citation for the dataset is as follows:

- **X-CLAIM Dataset**: 
  > Shubham Mittal, Megha Sundriyal, and Preslav Nakov. *Lost in Translation, Found in Spans: Identifying Claims in Multilingual Social Media*. In Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1-15, 2023. Available at: https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/x-claim

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation. The dataset entry will be ready for further processing or review.
