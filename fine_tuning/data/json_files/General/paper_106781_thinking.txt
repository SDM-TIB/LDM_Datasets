To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic hardware system for cascade SVM classification of melanoma" by Shereen Afifi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the development of a handheld device for melanoma detection and mentions the use of image-based diagnostic tools, which suggests that datasets related to melanoma images may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 4 (Experimental Results and Discussion)** and **section 4.1 (Implemented SVM models)**. In section 4.1, the authors mention using a dataset of **356 clinical images**, which includes **168 melanoma images** and **188 benign images**. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset mentioned. The authors refer to their previous work for the dataset used for model training, which is indicated as follows:

- For the dataset of clinical images, the citation is:
  > Afifi, S., GholamHosseini, H., & Sinha, R. (2016). Hardware Acceleration of SVM-based classifier for melanoma images. In Huang, F., & Sugimoto, A. (Eds.), *Image and video technology—PSIVT 2015 workshops: RV 2015, GPID 2013, VG 2015, EO4AS 2015, MCBMIIA 2015, and VSWS 2015, Auckland, New Zealand, November 23-27, 2015. Revised Selected Papers*. Springer International Publishing, pp. 235–245.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **Dataset of Clinical Images**: This dataset consists of 356 clinical images, including 168 melanoma and 188 benign images, which are used for training the SVM models.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant dataset information from the paper.
