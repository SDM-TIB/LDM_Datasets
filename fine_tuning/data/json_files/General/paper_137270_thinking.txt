To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Survival Trees: A Dynamic Programming Approach" by Tim Huisman, Jacobus G. M. van der Linden, and Emir DemiroviÄ‡, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses survival analysis and mentions the use of various datasets for experiments, which indicates that I should look for specific names in the following sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, I will look for any tables or lists that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Upon reviewing the experiments section, I find that the authors mention several datasets sourced from the SurvSet repository. The datasets listed include:

1. **Aids2**: Contains 2839 instances with 38.0% censoring.
2. **Dialysis**: Contains 6805 instances with 76.4% censoring.
3. **Framingham**: Contains 4658 instances with 68.5% censoring.
4. **Unempdur**: Contains 3241 instances with 38.7% censoring.
5. **Acath**: Contains 2258 instances with 34.0% censoring.
6. **Csl**: Contains 2481 instances with 89.1% censoring.
7. **Datadivat1**: Contains 5943 instances with 83.6% censoring.
8. **Datadivat3**: Contains 4267 instances with 94.4% censoring.
9. **Divorce**: Contains 3371 instances with 69.4% censoring.
10. **Flchain**: Contains 6524 instances with 69.9% censoring.
11. **Hdfail**: Contains 52422 instances with 94.5% censoring.
12. **Nwtco**: Contains 4028 instances with 85.8% censoring.
13. **Oldmort**: Contains 6495 instances with 69.7% censoring.
14. **Prostatesurvival**: Contains 14294 instances with 94.4% censoring.
15. **Rott2**: Contains 2982 instances with 57.3% censoring.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the SurvSet repository as the source for the datasets, which is crucial for providing the proper citation.

The citation for the SurvSet repository is:
> Drysdale, E. (2022). SurvSet: An open-source time-to-event dataset repository. arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.03094.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation. This will include the dataset name, the number of instances, the percentage of censoring, and the full citation for the source.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
