To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Closing the Loop: Graph Networks to Unify Semantic Objects and Visual Features for Multi-object Scenes" by Jonathan J.Y. Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets or references to previous works that might have used datasets. This section may provide insights into the datasets' relevance to the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics. The authors mention using five publicly available datasets for evaluation, which is a clear indication that I need to extract this information.

The paper specifies the following datasets:

1. **fr2-desk**: A dataset from the TUM dataset, which is used for evaluating loop closure detection in a desktop environment.
2. **fr3-longoffice**: Another dataset from the TUM dataset, used for evaluating loop closure detection in a long office environment.
3. **uoa-lounge**: A dataset from the University of Auckland multi-objects dataset, used for evaluating loop closure detection in a lounge setting.
4. **uoa-kitchen**: Another dataset from the University of Auckland multi-objects dataset, used for evaluating loop closure detection in a kitchen environment.
5. **uoa-garden**: A dataset from the University of Auckland multi-objects dataset, used for evaluating loop closure detection in a garden setting.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations will provide the necessary details for each dataset, including authors, titles, and publication information.

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For the **TUM dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sturm, J., Engelhard, N., Endres, F., Burgard, W., & Cremers, D. (2012). *A benchmark for the evaluation of RGB-D SLAM systems*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robot Systems.

- For the **University of Auckland multi-objects dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kim, J., Urschler, M., Riddle, P., & Wicker, J. (2021). *Symbiolcd: Ensemble-based loop closure detection using CNN-extracted objects and visual bag-of-words*. In International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
