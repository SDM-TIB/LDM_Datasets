To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Closed-form Solution to Universal Style Transfer" by Ming Lu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors derive a closed-form solution for style transfer and discusses the use of various datasets, which suggests that there may be specific datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the context of their work. They mention that their method is based on training decoders on large datasets like **COCO**. This indicates that COCO is a dataset used in their research.

In the **methodology section**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets used for training or evaluation. The authors state that they trained their decoders on the **COCO dataset**. I will note down the details about this dataset, including its purpose and any relevant statistics provided in the paper.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the COCO dataset. The citation for the COCO dataset is as follows:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollar, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740â€“755, Springer, 2014.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for training the decoders in the proposed method. It is a large-scale dataset that includes images with annotations for object detection, segmentation, and captioning.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
