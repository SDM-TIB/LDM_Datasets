To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ISD: Self-Supervised Learning by Iterative Similarity Distillation" by Ajinkya Tejankar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the method achieves competitive results on ImageNet and unbalanced unlabeled data, which suggests that datasets are involved. The introduction will likely provide more context on the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments and mention various datasets used for evaluation, including:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for training and evaluating image classification models. The paper states that their method is evaluated on the full ImageNet dataset.

2. **Food101**: This dataset consists of 101 food categories, with a total of 101,000 images. The authors mention using this dataset for transfer learning evaluation.

3. **CIFAR-10**: A well-known dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The authors also use this dataset for evaluation.

4. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images. This dataset is mentioned in the context of transfer learning.

5. **SUN397**: A dataset with 397 scene categories, which is also used for evaluation in the paper.

6. **Cars**: This dataset contains images of cars across various categories and is used for evaluating the model's performance.

7. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset used for evaluating texture classification, mentioned in the context of transfer learning.

8. **Pets**: A dataset containing images of various pet breeds, used for evaluation.

9. **Caltech-101**: This dataset consists of 101 object categories and is also mentioned for evaluation purposes.

10. **Flowers**: A dataset containing images of flowers, used for evaluation in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will include:

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
