To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reshaping free-text radiology notes into structured reports with generative transformers" by Laura Bergomi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used **174 radiology reports** for their study, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically **section 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of **174 free-text radiology reports** on CT examinations investigating lymph-node lesions. They mention that these reports were supplied by the Department of Radiology, I.R.C.C.S. Policlinico San Matteo Foundation of Pavia, Italy, and that they were completely anonymized.

The authors also provide additional details about the dataset, such as the length of the reports, the nature of the annotations, and the inter-annotator agreement, which further confirms the dataset's significance.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from internal reports and not a publicly available dataset, there may not be a formal citation. Instead, I will note the source as the institution that provided the dataset.

The relevant dataset information I will extract includes:
1. **Dataset Name**: Radiology Reports Dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset consisting of 174 free-text radiology reports on CT examinations investigating lymph-node lesions.
3. **Source**: Department of Radiology, I.R.C.C.S. Policlinico San Matteo Foundation, Pavia, Italy.

Since this dataset is not published in a traditional sense, I will document it as an internal dataset from the institution.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that I include all relevant details and the source of the dataset for future reference.
