To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-Scale Dependency Modeling for Skin Lesion Segmentation with Transformer-based Networks" by Sania Eskandari and Janet Lumpp, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of a skin lesion segmentation benchmark dataset, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors provide more context about the datasets used. The introduction discusses the importance of automatic segmentation for skin cancer diagnosis but does not specify any datasets.

In the **method section**, the authors explicitly mention the use of the **ISIC 2018 skin lesion benchmark dataset**. They provide details about the dataset, including that it contains 2,594 images, with a breakdown of how many samples were used for training, validation, and testing. This section is crucial as it provides both the name of the dataset and its characteristics.

I will also check the **results section** to confirm that the dataset mentioned is indeed the one used for evaluation. The results table references performance metrics calculated on the ISIC 2018 dataset, reinforcing its significance in the study.

Finally, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ISIC 2018 dataset. The authors do not provide a direct citation for the dataset in the text, so I will need to find the original source of the ISIC 2018 dataset from the literature.

The citation for the ISIC 2018 dataset is:
> Tschandl, P., Rosendahl, C., & Kittler, H. (2018). The HAM10000 dataset: A large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. *Scientific Data*, 5, 180161.

Now, I will compile the information about the dataset into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation as required. This will allow for proper referencing and acknowledgment of the dataset used in the research.
