To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "A Systematic Comparison of Encrypted Machine Learning Solutions for Image Classification" by Veneta Haralampieva et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using two datasets, which suggests that I should find their names and details.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors discuss the context of their research. They mention the use of two datasets: **MNIST** and **Malaria Cell Images**. This is a good starting point, but I need to gather more specific details about each dataset.

In the **experiments section**, particularly section 3.2.2, the authors provide a description of the datasets used. They state that the **MNIST dataset** consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 testing greyscale images of handwritten digits, while the **Malaria Cell Images dataset** contains 27,558 images classified into two categories: infected and uninfected. This section confirms the datasets used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and CJ Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

2. For the **Malaria Cell Images dataset**, the citation is:
   > Sivaramakrishnan Rajaraman, Sameer K Antani, Mahdieh Poostchi, Kamolrat Silamut, Md A Hossain, Richard J Maude, Stefan Jaeger, and George R Thoma. *Pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors toward improved malaria parasite detection in thin blood smear images*. PeerJ, 6:e4568, 2018.

With the dataset names and their full citations in hand, I will now prepare to compile this information into the required format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their proper references.
