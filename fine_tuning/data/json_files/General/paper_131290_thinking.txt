To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MELT: Mining Effective Lightweight Transformations from Pull Requests" by Daniel Ramos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and evaluation sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing the proposed methods. I will look for any tables, figures, or specific mentions of datasets, including their names and characteristics.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors mention evaluating MELT on pull requests from four popular libraries: **pandas, scipy, numpy, and sklearn**. I will note these libraries as they may represent datasets or sources of data used in the experiments.

I will also check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets or libraries mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

For the datasets identified, I will compile the following information:
1. **Dataset Name**: The name of the dataset or library.
2. **Description**: A brief description of what the dataset contains or its purpose.
3. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset or library, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

Based on the information gathered, I will ensure that each dataset is documented with its full citation to maintain academic integrity and provide a clear reference for future research.

After completing this process, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or utilized for further analysis.
