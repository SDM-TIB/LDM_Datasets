To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Method of Moments Embedding Constraint and its Application to Semi-Supervised Learning" by Michael Majurski et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the application of the proposed method to semi-supervised image classification using **CIFAR-10** and **STL-10** datasets. This indicates that these datasets are likely to be important for the experiments conducted in the paper.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In this section, the authors explicitly state that they applied their methodology to **CIFAR-10** and **STL-10**, both of which are well-known datasets in the field of machine learning.

I will then check the **references section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Adam Coates, Andrew Ng, and Honglak Lee. *An analysis of single-layer networks in unsupervised feature learning*. In Proceedings of the fourteenth international conference on artificial intelligence and statistics, pages 215â€“223. JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings, 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly describes each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
