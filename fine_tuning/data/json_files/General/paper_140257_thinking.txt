To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unfamiliar Finetuning Examples Control How Language Models Hallucinate" by Katie Kang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions controlled experiments involving **TriviaQA** and **MMLU**, indicating that these are datasets used in the study.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, such as **section 4 (Understanding How LLMs Hallucinate)** and **section 5 (Controlling Hallucinations in Long-Form Generations)**. In these sections, the authors describe their experiments and the datasets utilized for training and evaluation.

1. **TriviaQA**: This dataset is mentioned as a testbed for short-form question answering tasks. The authors reference the original paper for TriviaQA, which provides context on its structure and purpose.

   Full citation for TriviaQA:
   > Mandar Joshi, Eunsol Choi, Daniel S Weld, and Luke Zettlemoyer. *Triviaqa: A large scale distantly supervised challenge dataset for reading comprehension*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.03551, 2017.

2. **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)**: This dataset is also used for evaluating the model's performance on multiple-choice tasks. The authors provide insights into how they manipulate the unfamiliarity of the test queries based on this dataset.

   Full citation for MMLU:
   > Dan Hendrycks, Collin Burns, Steven Basart, Andy Zou, Mantas Mazeika, Dawn Song, and Jacob Steinhardt. *Measuring massive multitask language understanding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.03300, 2020.

Additionally, in the **long-form generation tasks** section, the authors mention using **WikiBios** and **WikiPlots** as datasets for biography and film/book plot generation tasks.

3. **WikiBios**: This dataset is used for generating biographies based on Wikipedia entries.

   Full citation for WikiBios:
   > Marco Antonio Stranisci, Rossana Damiano, Enrico Mensa, Viviana Patti, Daniele Radicioni, and Tommaso Caselli. *Wikibio: a semantic resource for the intersectional analysis of biographical events*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.09505, 2023.

4. **WikiPlots**: This dataset is used for generating plots of films and books based on Wikipedia entries.

   Full citation for WikiPlots:
   > Jon Bell. *Wikiplots*. 2017. URL: https://github.com/markriedl/WikiPlots.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for easy reference. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations for future use or analysis.
