To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Channel Attention Based MLP-Mixer Network for Motor Imagery Decoding with EEG" by Yanbin He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are based on a newly built dataset, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the application of deep learning methods for EEG-based motor imagery decoding, but they do not specify any datasets yet. I will continue to the methodology section for more details.

In **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors explicitly mention the **MI-2 dataset**. They describe it as consisting of 25 right-handed healthy subjects and detail the tasks involved, such as imagining different joint movements and resting states. This section provides a clear description of the dataset's structure and purpose.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MI-2 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **MI-2 dataset**, the citation is:
  > X. Ma, S. Qiu, and H. He. "Multi-channel EEG recording during motor imagery of different joints from the same limb." *Scientific Data*, vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 1-9, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **MI-2 Dataset**: This dataset consists of EEG recordings from 25 right-handed healthy subjects, capturing three different tasks related to motor imagery. The EEG signals were recorded using a 64-channel gel electrode cap, and each recording lasts for 4 seconds.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the MI-2 dataset.
