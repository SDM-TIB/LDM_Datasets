To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cellcounter: a deep learning framework for high-fidelity spatial localization of neurons" by Tamal Batabyal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the model is trained on images containing incompletely-annotated neurons and control images. This indicates that there are specific datasets involved, but I need to find their names and details.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Results and Discussion)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four primary datasets, specifically focusing on tdTomato-expressed neurons in Trap2 mice, and also reference a dataset called "Mixed data" that combines structural information from different imaging modalities.

In this section, the authors provide details about the datasets:
1. **tdTomato full dataset**: This dataset contains 2006 control images without neurons and 5614 images containing incompletely-labeled neurons.
2. **Mixed data**: This dataset consists of 1077 control images and 3826 images with neurons, which are used to study the effects of control images on the performance of the model.
3. **NeuN dataset**: This dataset is mentioned in the supplementary materials, where the authors report results on neuronal localization with good quality NeuN staining.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely derived from the authors' own experiments with transgenic reporter mice and various staining techniques.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is essential to credit the source of the datasets.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Tamal Batabyal, Aijaz Ahmad Naik, Daniel Weller, Jaideep Kapur. *Cellcounter: a deep learning framework for high-fidelity spatial localization of neurons*. Preprint submitted to Journal of LATEX Templates, March 22, 2021.

I will summarize the datasets as follows:
1. **tdTomato full dataset**: Contains 2006 control images without neurons and 5614 images with incompletely-labeled neurons.
2. **Mixed data**: Comprises 1077 control images and 3826 images with neurons.
3. **NeuN dataset**: Used for neuronal localization with good quality staining.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare to present it in the required structured format for further processing or review.
