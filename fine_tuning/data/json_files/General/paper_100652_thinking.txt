To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Training With Data Dependent Dynamic Learning Rates" by Shreyas Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the optimization framework and its application to image classification tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 3) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **Section 3.2**, they specifically mention using the **CIFAR100 dataset** for their image classification experiments. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed optimization framework.

In the **experiments section**, they provide details about the CIFAR100 dataset, stating that it contains 100 classes with 50,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. This information is essential for accurately describing the dataset.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CIFAR100 dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, University of Toronto, 2009.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and citation.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the CIFAR100 dataset that can be used for further analysis or integration into a larger dataset repository.
