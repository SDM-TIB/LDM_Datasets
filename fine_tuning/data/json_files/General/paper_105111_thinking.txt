To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring Hidden Bias within Face Recognition via Racial Phenotypes" by Seyma Yucer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of two datasets: **RFW** for face verification and **VGGFace2** for face identification. This indicates that these datasets are central to the research.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and highlight their focus on the RFW and VGGFace2 datasets. This reinforces the importance of these datasets in their analysis.

In **section 5 (Annotation of Racial Phenotypes)**, the authors explicitly state that they used the **RFW dataset** for face verification and the **VGGFace2 dataset** for face identification. They provide details about the characteristics of these datasets, such as the number of subjects and images, which further confirms their relevance.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources.

The citations I need to extract are:

1. **RFW Dataset**:
   > Mei Wang, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu, Xunqiang Tao, and Yaohai Huang. *Racial Faces in the Wild: Reducing Racial Bias by Information Maximization Adaptation Network*. In IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2019.

2. **VGGFace2 Dataset**:
   > Qiong Cao, Li Shen, Weidi Xie, Omkar M Parkhi, and Andrew Zisserman. *VGGFace2: A Dataset for Recognising Faces Across Pose and Age*. In IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face & Gesture Recognition, 2018.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, as this is essential for academic integrity and proper referencing.
