To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Quasi-Taylor Samplers for Diffusion Generative Models Based on Ideal Derivatives" by Hideyuki Tachibana et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about how they were utilized in the experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets:

1. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **CelebA**: This dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels. It is widely used for tasks related to facial recognition and attribute prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical report, 2009. Available at: http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **CelebA**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pp. 3730â€“3738, 2015. Available for non-commercial research purposes only.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture the datasets referenced in the paper and provide proper attribution.
