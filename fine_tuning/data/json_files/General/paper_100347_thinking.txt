To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "House Price Prediction using Satellite Imagery" by Sina Jandaghi Semnani and Hoormazd Rezaei, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a property assessment dataset from Los Angeles County and satellite images collected via the Google Static Maps API. This suggests that there are at least two datasets to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset and Features)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **LA County Property Assessment Dataset**: This dataset consists of over 2 million real estate properties assessed between 2006 and 2017, with 50 features per property, including floor area, number of bedrooms, and geographic coordinates. The dataset is publicly available at the provided URL.

2. **Satellite Images Dataset**: The authors collected high-resolution satellite images using the Google Static Maps API, specifically at a zoom level of 19, resulting in images sized 640x640 pixels. This dataset is crucial for their model as it provides visual context for the properties.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LA County Property Assessment Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Los Angeles County. *Assessor Parcels Data 2017*. Available at: https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Parcels-Data-2017/vak5-2hqh.

- For the **Google Static Maps API**, while it is not a traditional dataset, I will cite it as follows:
  > Google. *Google Static Maps API*. Available at: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/intro.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This will prepare the information for structured output or further processing.
