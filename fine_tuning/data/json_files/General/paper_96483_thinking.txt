To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Parallel Blockwise Knowledge Distillation for Deep Neural Network Compression" by Cody Blakeney et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of deep neural networks and the need for compression techniques, but I need to look for specific datasets. I will then check the **methodology and experimental results sections** for any explicit mentions of datasets used in their experiments.

In **section 4.1.4 (Datasets)**, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset contains 60,000 RGB images of size 32 x 32 pixels, divided into 10 classes, with 5,000 images for training and 1,000 for testing. It is widely used in model compression research.

2. **ImageNet**: This dataset consists of 1.28 million training images and 50,000 validation images across 1,000 classes. It is a standard benchmark for image recognition and object detection tasks.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Su, Jonathan Krause, Sanjeev Satheesh, Sean Ma, Zhiheng Huang, Andrej Karpathy, Aditya Khosla, Michael Bernstein, et al. *Imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211â€“252, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
