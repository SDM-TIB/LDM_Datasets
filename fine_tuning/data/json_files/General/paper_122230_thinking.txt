To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Self-supervised learning-based cervical cytology for the triage of HPV-positive women in resource-limited settings and low-data regime" by Thomas Stegmüller et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed an in-house dataset of Pap smear images, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their research. Here, they mention:

1. **In-house dataset**: This dataset consists of 307 Pap smear slides from HPV-positive patients, with a breakdown of 69 positive and 238 negative slides. The slides are prepared using the SurePath™ procedure, and the dataset includes 1228 annotated positive cells and approximately 1.5 million unlabeled tiles.

2. **Herlev Dataset**: This dataset includes 917 labeled cell images from liquid-based cytology Pap smear tests. It contains both cytology-negative and cytology-positive images, with specific annotations for various cell types.

3. **Sipakmed Dataset**: This dataset comprises 4049 labeled cell images from Pap smear images, categorized into cytology-negative and cytology-positive images, with specific annotations for different cell types.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **Herlev Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jantzen, J., Norup, J., Dounias, G., Bjerregaard, B. (2005). *Pap-smear benchmark data for pattern classification*. Nature inspired Smart Information Systems (NiSIS 2005), 1–9.

- For the **Sipakmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Plissiti, M.E., Dimitrakopoulos, P., Sfikas, G., Nikou, C., Krikoni, O., Charchanti, A. (2018). *Sipakmed: A new dataset for feature and image based classification of normal and pathological cervical cells in pap smear images*. In 2018 25th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), pp. 3144–3148. doi:10.1109/ICIP.2018.8451588.

The in-house dataset does not have a formal citation since it is introduced by the authors themselves.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the Herlev and Sipakmed datasets, while noting that the in-house dataset is not formally cited.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
