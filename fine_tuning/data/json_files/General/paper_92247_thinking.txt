To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Attentive Feature Reuse for Multi Task Meta learning" by Kiran Lekkala and Laurent Itti, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the development of algorithms for multiple tasks and adapting to unseen task distributions, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for specific mentions of datasets or benchmarks in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they introduce the **Multi Meta Tasks dataset (MMT)**, which is a dataset of datasets designed for evaluating their proposed method. The authors specify that this dataset includes four high-level tasks: scene classification, depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and vanishing point estimation. This indicates that MMT is a crucial dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **appendices** for any additional details about the datasets, as they sometimes contain supplementary information that is not included in the main text. 

In the **references section**, I will look for full citations of the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to several datasets in the context of the MMT dataset, including:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
