To extract datasets from the research paper titled "360FusionNeRF: Panoramic Neural Radiance Fields with Joint Guidance" by Shreyas Kulkarni et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their method on several datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or specific names of datasets. The introduction discusses the importance of 360° imagery and mentions the use of various datasets, but I need to find the exact names.

I will then focus on the **experiments** section, particularly the part where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **Structured3D Dataset**: This dataset contains 3,500 synthetic scenes with 185,985 photo-realistic panoramic renderings. The authors note that the original virtual environment is not publicly accessible, but they utilized the rendered panoramas directly.

2. **Matterport3D Dataset**: This is a large-scale indoor dataset captured by Matterport’s Pro 3D camera, consisting of 10,800 RGB-D panorama images from 90 furnished houses. The authors mention that some RGB-D signals near the polar region are missing.

3. **Replica360 Dataset**: This dataset includes 18 highly photo-realistic 3D indoor scene reconstructions at room and building scale.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper:

- For the **Structured3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zheng, J., Zhang, J., Li, J., Tang, R., Gao, S., & Zhou, Z. (2020). Structured3D: A large photo-realistic dataset for structured 3D modeling. In *European Conference on Computer Vision*. Springer, pp. 519–535.

- For the **Matterport3D Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D data in indoor environments. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158.

- For the **Replica360 Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further processing or review.
