To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On an application of graph neural networks in population based SHM" by G. Tsialiamanis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention datasets used for testing the proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section**, particularly **section 4**, where the authors describe their case studies. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used, including how they were generated and their characteristics.

In **section 4.1 (Case study one)**, the authors mention that they generated three datasets for cross-validation, each consisting of 16,000 truss configurations. This indicates that there is a dataset specifically created for the experiments.

In **section 4.2 (Case study two)**, the authors describe another population of trusses with different configurations, which suggests that there is a second dataset involved in their experiments.

Now, I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their names, characteristics, and how they were generated. The authors mention using random generation of trusses with varying numbers of nodes and environmental conditions, which is important for understanding the datasets' context.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or related works that are referenced. If the authors refer to existing datasets, I will ensure to include those citations as well.

Based on the information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. 

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its characteristics, and the corresponding citations, ready for further processing or review.
