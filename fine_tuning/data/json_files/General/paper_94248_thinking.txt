To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Federated Learning with Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Momentum Method" by Zhengjie Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that "extensive experiments based on real-world datasets are conducted," which indicates that datasets are used, but it does not specify which ones.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section VI) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention using two real-world datasets: **MNIST** and **CIFAR-10**. I will note the details provided about each dataset.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe it as containing gray-scale images of 70,000 samples (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). This dataset is widely used for image classification tasks.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as containing 60,000 color images (50,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). It is also a well-known dataset in the field of image classification.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. "Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images." 2009.

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
