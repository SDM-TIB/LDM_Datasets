To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Detection of Illicit Drug Trafficking Events on Instagram: A Deep Multimodal Multilabel Learning Approach" by Chuanbo Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be introduced early on. The abstract mentions a newly constructed dataset called **multimodal IDTE (MM-IDTE)**, which is a strong indication that this is a key dataset for the study.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Multimodal IDTE (MM-IDTE) Dataset Construction)**, as this section is likely to provide detailed information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe the MM-IDTE dataset, which contains nearly 4,000 posts and over 6,000 comments, specifically designed for fine-grained detection of illicit drug trafficking events on Instagram. This section outlines the data collection process, the types of data included (text and images), and the manual annotation process.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset includes multiple drug labels and that it is the largest multimodal dataset for this purpose to date. This confirms the significance of the MM-IDTE dataset in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MM-IDTE dataset. However, since the dataset is newly constructed by the authors themselves, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is described in detail within the paper itself.

The citation for the paper is as follows:
> Chuanbo Hu, Minglei Yin, Bin Liu, Xin Li, and Yanfang Ye. 2021. Detection of Illicit Drug Trafficking Events on Instagram: A Deep Multimodal Multilabel Learning Approach. In Proceedings of the 30th ACM Int’l Conf. on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM ’21), November 1–5, 2021, Virtual Event, Australia. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3459637.3481908

Since the MM-IDTE dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will document it as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Multimodal IDTE (MM-IDTE)
   - **Description**: A large-scale dataset constructed for fine-grained detection of illicit drug trafficking events on Instagram, containing nearly 4,000 posts and over 6,000 comments, with multiple drug labels.
   - **Citation**: Refer to the paper by Chuanbo Hu et al. (2021) for details.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
