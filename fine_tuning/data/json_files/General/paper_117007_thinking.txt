To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Instance Selection Algorithm for Big Data in High Imbalanced Datasets Based on LSH" by GermÃ¡n E. Melo-Acosta et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on three different datasets, which indicates that I should find specific names and details of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 3.1), where the authors provide a table summarizing the datasets used. The table includes the following datasets:

1. **Credit Card Dataset**: This dataset consists of anonymized credit card transactions and has an imbalance ratio (IR) of 577, with a total of 285,299 samples and 29 features.

2. **Page Blocks Dataset**: This dataset has an IR of 9, with a total of 5,473 samples and 10 features. It is noted as a benchmark in the context of instance selection methods.

3. **Gateway Credit Card Dataset**: This dataset contains over 6 million samples derived from credit card transactions from a payment gateway, with 133 features. The IR is not explicitly stated but is implied to be significant.

I will then check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The references may not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but I will note any relevant papers or sources mentioned in relation to the datasets.

For the **Credit Card Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dal Pozzolo, A., Caelen, O., Le Borgne, Y.-A., Waterschoot, S., & Bontempi, G. (2014). Learned lessons in credit card fraud detection from a practitioner perspective. *Expert Systems with Applications*, 41(10), 4915-4928.

For the **Page Blocks Dataset**, the citation is:
> Dua, D., & Graff, C. (2017). UCI Machine Learning Repository. Retrieved from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml

For the **Gateway Credit Card Dataset**, the citation is:
> Kaggle Inc. (2021). Credit card fraud detection. Retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
