To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Extracting periodontitis diagnosis in clinical notes with RoBERTa and regular expression" by Yao-Shun Chuang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's goals and methods, which may hint at the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Methods and Material)**, particularly the subsection **A (Dataset)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for their analysis. Here, they mention that the data were extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR) for a specific time frame (January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021) and provide details about the inclusion criteria for the cases. They state that there were a total of 5,495 qualifying patients, leading to 8,125 clinical notes being extracted.

In this section, I will also note that 60 clinical notes were randomly selected as the gold standard for accuracy checking, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's validation process.

After identifying the dataset, I will look for the **References section** to find full citations for any datasets or methodologies referenced in the paper. The authors refer to the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) and European Federation of Periodontology (EFP) classification of periodontitis, which is relevant for understanding the context of the dataset but does not constitute a separate dataset citation.

I will also check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the context of related work or methodologies, particularly in the **discussion** or **conclusion** sections, but it seems that the primary dataset is the clinical notes extracted from EHRs.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. The citation for the classification system used in the study is:

- For the AAP/EFP classification of periodontitis:
  > P. N. Papapanou et al., “Periodontitis: Consensus report of workgroup 2 of the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions,” J. Periodontol., vol. 89, no. S1, pp. S173–S182, 2018, doi: 10.1002/JPER.17-0721.

With this information, I will create an entry for the dataset that includes the description of the dataset, the number of clinical notes, and the citation for the classification system used in the study. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the necessary details regarding the dataset utilized in the research.
