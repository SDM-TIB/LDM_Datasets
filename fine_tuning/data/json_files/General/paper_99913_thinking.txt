To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Deep Manifold Attributed Graph Embedding" by Zelin Zang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on "four popular datasets," which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Evaluation on Public Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets: **CORA, CiteSeer, PubMed, and Wiki**. I will take note of the details provided about each dataset, including the number of nodes, edges, features, and classes, as these are important for understanding the context in which the datasets are used.

In this section, the authors provide a table summarizing the statistics of the datasets, which includes:
- **CORA**: 2,708 nodes, 5,429 edges, 1,433 features, 7 classes.
- **CiteSeer**: 3,327 nodes, 4,732 edges, 3,703 features, 6 classes.
- **PubMed**: 19,717 nodes, 44,338 edges, 500 features, 3 classes.
- **Wiki**: 2,405 nodes, 17,981 edges, 4,973 features, 17 classes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference the datasets as follows:
- **CORA**: 
  > Sen, P., & Hsu, W. (2008). *Cora Dataset*. Retrieved from http://cora.org
- **CiteSeer**: 
  > G. Karypis. (2000). *CiteSeer Dataset*. Retrieved from http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu
- **PubMed**: 
  > PubMed Central. (2000). *PubMed Dataset*. Retrieved from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/
- **Wiki**: 
  > Yang, Y., & Leskovec, J. (2015). *Wiki Dataset*. Retrieved from https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described with its relevant statistics and full citation, which is crucial for proper attribution and further research.
