To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Im2Oil: Stroke-Based Oil Painting Rendering with Linearly Controllable Fineness Via Adaptive Sampling" by Zhengyan Tong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses related work and may reference datasets used in previous studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will look for any specific names of datasets, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention a **Mean Opinion Score (MOS) test** and a **gallery dataset** with fifty input images, divided into five sets: scenery, portrait, animal, building, and still life. However, the specific datasets used for training or evaluation are not explicitly named in the provided text.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations that might correspond to datasets. If the authors refer to datasets from other works, I will extract those citations to provide full references.

Since the paper does not provide explicit dataset names or detailed descriptions, I will summarize the findings as follows:

1. **Gallery Dataset**: A collection of fifty input images used for the MOS test, categorized into five sets (scenery, portrait, animal, building, still life). However, no specific citation or external reference is provided for this dataset.

2. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods**: The authors compare their method with results from three other techniques, but again, no specific datasets are mentioned for these comparisons.

Since the paper lacks explicit dataset names and citations, I will note that while the authors conducted experiments and comparisons, the datasets themselves are not detailed in the text. 

Finally, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that any dataset references are accurately cited, even if they are not explicitly named in the paper.
