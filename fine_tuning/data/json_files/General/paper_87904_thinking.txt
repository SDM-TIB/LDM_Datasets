To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tropical Polynomial Division and Neural Networks" by Georgios Smyrnis and Petros Maragos, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 6). Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**: This dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, split evenly into training and test sets. The authors mention preprocessing steps, such as keeping 5,000 words and truncating or padding sequences to a fixed length of 200.

2. **MNIST Dataset**: The authors describe using pairs of digits (4-9 and 3-6) for a binary classification problem, as well as the entire dataset for distinguishing even and odd digits.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **IMDB Movie Review Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Maas, A. L., Daly, R. E., Pham, P. T., Huang, D., Ng, A. Y., & Potts, C. (2011). Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis. In Proceedings of the ACL (pp. 142-150).

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > LeCun, Y., Bottou, L., Bengio, Y., & Haffner, P. (1998). Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition. Proceedings of the IEEE, 86(11), 2278-2324.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
