To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invertible Residual Networks" by Jens Behrmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract discusses the performance of the proposed architecture on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In the experiments section, the authors mention that they validate their model on **CIFAR10**, **CIFAR100**, and **MNIST** datasets. I will note down the details provided for each dataset, including the number of classes, the number of images, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily. 

For the datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

2. **CIFAR100**: The citation is the same as CIFAR10 since they are part of the same dataset collection.

3. **MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, its characteristics, and the corresponding citations. This will ensure that the extraction is comprehensive and useful for future reference or analysis.
