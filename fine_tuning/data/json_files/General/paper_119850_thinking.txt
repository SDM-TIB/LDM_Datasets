To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Solving the Weather4cast Challenge via Visual Transformers for 3D Images" by Yury Belousov et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the Weather4cast challenge, which implies the use of specific datasets for weather prediction tasks. 

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention that the rainfall events data is provided by the **Operational Program for Exchange of Weather Radar Information (OPERA)** and the satellite images are from the **European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)**. This indicates that these organizations provide the datasets used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **OPERA Dataset**: The authors refer to the rainfall events data provided by OPERA. The citation for OPERA is not explicitly mentioned in the paper, but I can look for the official website or documentation that describes the dataset.

2. **EUMETSAT Satellite Images**: Similarly, the satellite images are provided by EUMETSAT. Again, I will need to find the official citation or documentation for this dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both the OPERA dataset and the EUMETSAT satellite images. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
