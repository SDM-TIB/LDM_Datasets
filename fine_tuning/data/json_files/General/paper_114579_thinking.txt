To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sample hardness based gradient loss for long-tailed cervical cell detection" by Minmin Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on a long-tailed TCT WSI image dataset, which suggests that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors describe the CCA-LT dataset. They mention that this dataset was established to better represent the long-tailed distribution of cervical cancer data. The section provides details about how the dataset was captured, its structure, and how it was divided into training-validation and test sets.

The CCA-LT dataset is described as follows:
- **CCA-LT Dataset**: Captured by a whole-slide scanning machine using the Thinprep Cytology Test method with H&E staining. The dataset consists of images with a resolution of approximately 80000×60000 pixels and is divided into training-validation and test sets (7:3). Each whole slide image is cropped into patches of 512×512 pixels for training.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CCA-LT dataset. However, since this dataset appears to be newly established by the authors, it may not have a separate citation in the references. Instead, I will note that the dataset is available on GitHub as indicated in the paper.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
- For **CCA-LT Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Minmin, et al. "Sample hardness based gradient loss for long-tailed cervical cell detection." *arXiv preprint arXiv:XXXX.XXXX* (2023). [Link to dataset](https://github.com/M-LLiu/Grad-Libra)

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This includes the dataset name, description, and citation, ensuring that all necessary details are captured accurately.
