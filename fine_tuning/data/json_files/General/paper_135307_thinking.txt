To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Comparison of pipeline, sequence-to-sequence, and GPT models for end-to-end relation extraction: experiments with the rare disease use-case" by Shashank Gupta et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **RareDis information extraction dataset** for evaluating the methods, which indicates that this is a key dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of end-to-end relation extraction (E2ERE) and mention the **RareDis dataset** specifically as it relates to rare diseases. This reinforces the importance of this dataset in their research.

In the **methods section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the **RareDis dataset**. They explain that it was created for information extraction related to rare diseases and includes various entity and relation types. They also mention that the dataset contains discontinuous and overlapping entities, which is crucial for understanding its complexity.

I will also check the **results and discussion sections** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned or if there are any references to other datasets used for comparison. However, the primary focus remains on the **RareDis dataset**.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the **RareDis dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> Martínez-deMiguel C, Segura-Bedmar I, Chacón-Solano E, Guerrero-Aspizua S. *The RareDis corpus: a corpus annotated with rare diseases, their signs and symptoms*. Journal of Biomedical Informatics. 2022;125:103961.

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the **RareDis dataset**. 

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entry is structured correctly and includes the full citation, as this is essential for proper attribution and further research.

In summary, the key steps I followed are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the main dataset.
2. Review the methods section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Check the references for the full citation of the dataset.
4. Compile the dataset entry with all necessary details and citations.
