To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depth-Relative Self Attention for Monocular Depth Estimation" by Kyuhong Shim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiment sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on monocular depth estimation benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of monocular depth estimation and reference various works, but I need to look for specific datasets mentioned. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **NYU-v2 Dataset**: This dataset includes pairs of RGB images and depth maps across 464 indoor scenes, with a depth range of up to 10 meters. The authors specify that they use a subset of 50K samples for training.

2. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset consists of paired RGB images and corresponding depth maps obtained from a 3D laser scanner across 61 outdoor scenes. The depth annotations range up to 80 meters, and the authors mention using two training/testing splits: one following the Eigen split and another for online depth prediction.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **NYU-v2 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Nathan Silberman, Derek Hoiem, Pushmeet Kohli, and Rob Fergus. *Indoor segmentation and support inference from rgbd images*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 746–760. Springer, 2012.

- For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, Christoph Stiller, and Raquel Urtasun. *Vision meets robotics: The kitti dataset*. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 32(11):1231–1237, 2013.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach allows me to comprehensively capture the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the research paper.
