To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sensitivity and Generalization in Neural Networks: An Empirical Study" by Roman Novak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on "four different image classification datasets," which suggests that there are specific datasets used in their study.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors discuss their experiments in section 4, where they analyze the sensitivity of neural networks. I will focus on section 4.1 and 4.3, as these sections typically provide details about the datasets used.

Upon reviewing section 4.1, I find that the authors mention using the following datasets for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes containing 600 images each.
3. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing).
4. **Fashion-MNIST**: A dataset of Zalando's article images, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 categories, intended as a drop-in replacement for MNIST.

In section 4.3, the authors confirm that these datasets were used to evaluate the generalization capabilities of the neural networks they studied.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Convolutional deep belief networks on CIFAR-10*. 2010.

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. 1998.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. 2017.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
