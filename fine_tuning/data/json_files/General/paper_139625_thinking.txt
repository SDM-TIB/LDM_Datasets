To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Asymmetry in Low-Rank Adapters of Foundation Models" by Jiacheng Zhu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will focus on the introduction and experiments for detailed information about datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their experiments on various models, including RoBERTa, BART-Large, LLaMA-2, and Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, they do not explicitly mention datasets here, so I will need to look further.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. Here, the authors detail their methodology and the datasets used for evaluation. They mention using the **GLUE benchmark** for natural language understanding tasks, which consists of multiple datasets, and the **XSum** and **CNN/DailyMail** datasets for text summarization tasks. 

I will note down the datasets mentioned:

1. **GLUE Benchmark**: This benchmark includes various datasets for tasks like question-answering, textual similarity, and sentiment analysis. The specific datasets within GLUE include:
   - MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference)
   - SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)
   - MRPC (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus)
   - CoLA (Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability)
   - QNLI (Question Natural Language Inference)
   - RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment)
   - STS-B (Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark)

2. **XSum**: A dataset for extreme summarization, which requires generating a single-sentence summary from a news article.

3. **CNN/DailyMail**: A dataset commonly used for training and evaluating summarization models, consisting of news articles and their corresponding summaries.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **GLUE Benchmark**, the citation is:
  > Wang, A., Singh, A., Michael, J., Hill, F., Levy, O., and Bowman, S. (2018). *GLUE: A Multi-Task Benchmark and Analysis Platform for Natural Language Understanding*.

- For the **XSum dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **CNN/DailyMail dataset**, the citation is:

With this information, I can now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to extract and document the datasets effectively from the research paper.
