To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CrossEAI: Using Explainable AI to generate better bounding boxes for Chest X-ray images" by Jinze Zhao, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their model on a chest X-ray dataset, which suggests that there is a specific dataset being referenced.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology and results sections** to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used. In the **Results section (4.1)**, the authors explicitly mention the **NIH ChestX-ray8 dataset**. They provide a brief description, stating that it consists of 112,120 chest X-ray images collected from 30,805 patients and includes labels for 8 diseases. This is a clear indication that this dataset is central to their research.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the NIH ChestX-ray8 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **NIH ChestX-ray8 Dataset**: 
  > Wang, X., Peng, Y., Lu, L., Lu, Z., Bagheri, M., & Summers, R. M. (2017). *ChestX-ray8: Hospital-scale chest x-ray database and benchmarks on weakly-supervised classification and localization of common thorax diseases*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 2097â€“2106).

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the NIH ChestX-ray8 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for review or further processing.
