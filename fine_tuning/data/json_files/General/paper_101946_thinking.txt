To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Automated age-related macular degeneration area estimation – first results" by Rokas Pečiulis et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors collected RGB and contrast images for their study, which suggests that these images form the basis of their dataset.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, particularly **subsection 2.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets they used. Here, they mention that they collected **44 sets of age-related macular degeneration examination images** from the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Department of Ophthalmology. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

The authors also mention that they took **15 healthy fundus images from the Pattern Recognition Lab online database**. This indicates another dataset that needs to be included.

Now, I will gather the necessary details for each dataset:

1. **AMD Examination Images**: This dataset consists of 44 sets of images containing AMD-affected cases of varying degrees. The authors describe the preparation process, including the removal of personal information and the alignment of RGB and contrast images.

2. **Healthy Fundus Images**: This dataset includes 15 healthy fundus images sourced from the Pattern Recognition Lab online database. The authors mention that these images were used to create a balanced dataset for classification tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are likely proprietary or internal collections. The only external dataset mentioned is the one from the Pattern Recognition Lab.

For the **Pattern Recognition Lab dataset**, I will look for the original source or citation in the references. Since the paper cites it as a source, I will note that it is referenced as [8] in the paper, which corresponds to:
> Attila Budai, Rüdiger Bock, Andreas Maier, Joachim Hornegger, and Georg Michelson. *Robust vessel segmentation in fundus images*. International journal of biomedical imaging, 2013, 2013.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with the information I have gathered:

1. **Dataset Name**: AMD Examination Images
   - Description: A collection of 44 sets of age-related macular degeneration examination images collected from the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Department of Ophthalmology.
   - Citation: Not explicitly provided in the paper.

2. **Dataset Name**: Healthy Fundus Images
   - Description: A collection of 15 healthy fundus images sourced from the Pattern Recognition Lab online database.
   - Citation: Budai, A., Bock, R., Maier, A., Hornegger, J., & Michelson, G. (2013). *Robust vessel segmentation in fundus images*. International journal of biomedical imaging, 2013.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for further processing or review.
