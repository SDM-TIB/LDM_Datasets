To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Near-Optimal Experimental Design Under the Budget Constraint in Online Platforms" by Yuan Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract discusses testing the experimental design on both synthetic data and real-world data, which indicates that there are at least two datasets involved.

Next, I will look for specific sections that might detail the datasets used. The **experiments section** is likely to contain information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about how they were used in the study.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using:

1. **Synthetic Data**: This dataset is generated for the purpose of testing the theoretical results of the proposed experimental design. The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset since it is artificially created for the study.

2. **Real-World Data from Tencent**: This dataset includes information about advertisement impressions and costs from the Tencent advertisement platform. The paper does not provide a specific citation for this dataset either, as it is proprietary data collected from Tencent's operations.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for the datasets, I will note that the synthetic data is not citable, and the real-world data is proprietary and does not have a formal citation. However, I will still document the details of the real-world dataset as it is relevant to the study.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the descriptions of the datasets and their relevance to the research.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:

- **Synthetic Data**: Used for testing the theoretical results of the experimental design. No formal citation available.
- **Real-World Data from Tencent**: Contains advertisement impressions and costs. No formal citation available.

This structured approach allows me to clearly identify and document the datasets used in the research paper, even when formal citations are not provided.
