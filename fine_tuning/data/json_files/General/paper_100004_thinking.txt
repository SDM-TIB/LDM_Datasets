To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Search Algorithms for Automated Hyper-Parameter Tuning" by Leila Zahedi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a real-world educational dataset, specifically the **MIDFIELD** dataset, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of educational data mining and mention the MIDFIELD dataset again. They highlight its significance in predicting students' success, which confirms its relevance to their study.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the MIDFIELD dataset. They explain that it is a longitudinal dataset covering undergraduate students from 16 universities over a 30-year period, which includes various demographic and academic performance data. This section solidifies my understanding of the dataset's scope and application.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the MIDFIELD dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **MIDFIELD**:
  > Matthew W. Ohland, Guili Zhang, Brian Thorndyke, and Timothy J. Anderson. *The creation of the multiple-institution database for investigating engineering longitudinal development (MIDFIELD)*. Proc. Amer. Soc. Eng. Ed, 2004.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MIDFIELD dataset, I will ensure to document this dataset thoroughly, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format that captures the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
