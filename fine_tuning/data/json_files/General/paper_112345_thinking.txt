To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Reducing the Control Overhead of Intelligent Reconﬁgurable Surfaces Via a Tensor-Based Low-Rank Factorization Approach" by Bruno Sokal et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and I will look for any references to datasets used in the experiments or simulations.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** in detail, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets they used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the experiments section, I will check the **references section** for any cited works that may describe datasets. This is crucial because sometimes datasets are introduced in previous works that the current paper builds upon.

In this paper, I will specifically look for any mention of datasets related to intelligent reconﬁgurable surfaces or tensor-based approaches. If the authors refer to any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to retrieve the full citations for each dataset from the references section. This is important for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" used for simulations, I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
