To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Post-training deep neural network pruning via layer-wise calibration" by Ivan Lazarevich et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions achieving state-of-the-art results for data-free neural network pruning and references using real data, specifically **ImageNet**, which is a well-known dataset in the field.

Next, I will examine **section 1 (Introduction)**, where the authors discuss the challenges of deploying deep neural networks on edge devices and mention various datasets used for evaluation. Here, I will look for specific names of datasets that are referenced in the context of their experiments.

In **section 3 (Post-training sparsity pipeline)** and **section 4 (Conclusion)**, the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. They mention:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset commonly used for image classification tasks. The authors report results on this dataset, specifically mentioning top-1 accuracy metrics.
2. **Pascal VOC**: This dataset is referenced in the context of object detection, where the authors report mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics.
3. **COCO**: Another dataset mentioned for object detection tasks, with Average Precision (AP) metrics reported.
4. **WIDER FACE**: This dataset is referenced for face detection tasks, also reporting mAP metrics.
5. **MovieLens 20M**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of recommendation systems, with a hit ratio metric reported.
6. **MRPC**: This dataset is referenced for natural language processing tasks, with accuracy metrics reported.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

- For **Pascal VOC**, the citation is:
  > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher K. I. Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303-338, 2010.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Sergio F. Gonzalez, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **WIDER FACE**, the citation is:
  > Shuo Yang, J. Zhang, et al. *WIDER FACE: A Face Detection Benchmark*. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2016.

- For **MovieLens 20M**, the citation is:
  > F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. *The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context*. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems, 5(4):1-19, 2015.

- For **MRPC**, the citation is:
  > William B. Dolgov, et al. *The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus*. 2005.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included for reference. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
