To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Class Incremental Learning from Decentralized Data" by Xiaohan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any references to datasets used for experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention two datasets: **CIFAR100** and **subImageNet**. I will extract details about these datasets, including their characteristics and how they were utilized in the experiments.

1. **CIFAR100**: This dataset consists of 60,000 natural RGB images across 100 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The authors mention that they randomly flip images for data augmentation during training.

2. **subImageNet**: This dataset contains images of 100 classes randomly selected from ImageNet, comprising approximately 130,000 RGB images for training and 5,000 for testing. The authors describe the data augmentation process, which includes random flipping and cropping of images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > A. Krizhevsky and G. Hinton, “Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images,” Handbook of Systemic Autoimmune Diseases, vol. 1, no. 4, 2009.

- For **subImageNet**, the citation is:
  > O. Russakovsky et al., “ImageNet large scale visual recognition challenge,” International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that the datasets are properly documented and can be referenced in future work.
