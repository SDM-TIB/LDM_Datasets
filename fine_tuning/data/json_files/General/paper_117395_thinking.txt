To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Explainable Causal Analysis of Mental Health on Social Media Data" by Chandni Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors use the **CAMS dataset** for their analysis, which is a strong lead.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the **CAMS dataset**. They mention that it consists of 5051 instances, including 1896 from the SDCNL dataset and 3155 Reddit posts. The dataset is annotated by trained human annotators and verified by a clinical psychologist, which adds credibility to its use.

In this section, the authors also describe the dataset's purpose: to categorize the direct causes of mental disorders through user mentions in their posts. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's context and application.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **CAMS dataset**. The authors reference a paper that describes the dataset:

- For the **CAMS dataset**, the citation is:
  > Garg, M., Saxena, C., Krishnan, V., Joshi, R., Saha, S., Mago, V., Dorr, B.J. (2022). *CAMS: An Annotated Corpus for Causal Analysis of Mental Health Issues in Social Media Posts*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

Since the paper mentions the SDCNL dataset as well, I will look for its citation in the references. However, the details about the SDCNL dataset are not provided in the text, so I will note that it is mentioned but not elaborated upon.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the findings:

1. **CAMS Dataset**: Contains 5051 instances (1896 from SDCNL and 3155 Reddit posts). It is annotated for causal analysis of mental health issues.
   - Citation: Garg, M., Saxena, C., Krishnan, V., Joshi, R., Saha, S., Mago, V., Dorr, B.J. (2022). *CAMS: An Annotated Corpus for Causal Analysis of Mental Health Issues in Social Media Posts*. In Proceedings of the Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

2. **SDCNL Dataset**: Mentioned but not detailed in the paper. Further investigation would be needed to find its citation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citations are complete and accurate for any future use or analysis.
