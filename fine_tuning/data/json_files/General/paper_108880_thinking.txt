To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Advanced Methods for Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling of Human Intelligence: A Novel Approach Based on Individual Differences in Cortical Topography" by Evan D. Anderson et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any mention of datasets. The abstract discusses a large dataset of resting state EPI scans and diffusion tensor imaging data, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** and **data acquisition sections** for more detailed descriptions of the datasets. In the introduction, the authors mention the use of connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) and refer to individual differences in neurobiological connectivity, which indicates that they are working with specific datasets related to brain imaging.

In the **data acquisition section**, the authors provide specific details about the datasets:
1. **Resting State EPI Scans**: The dataset consists of 297 subjects, each with 10-minute resting state EPI scans acquired using 3 Tesla MRI.
2. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data**: This dataset includes data from 288 subjects, processed for probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves (resting state EPI scans and diffusion tensor imaging data) do not have specific citations in the references, as they are likely original datasets collected by the authors.

Since the paper does not provide external citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are original and created for the purpose of this study. I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Resting State EPI Scans**: A dataset of 297 subjects with 10-minute resting state EPI scans acquired using 3 Tesla MRI.
2. **Diffusion Tensor Imaging Data**: A dataset of 288 subjects processed for probabilistic diffusion tensor tractography.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format, ensuring that I clearly indicate that these datasets are original to the study and do not have external citations. This will be important for clarity in any downstream processing or review.
