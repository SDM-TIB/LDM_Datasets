To extract datasets from the research paper titled "GAFlow: Incorporating Gaussian Attention into Optical Flow" by Ao Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets that the authors used for their experiments. If the authors refer to specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, which typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for a dedicated subsection that discusses the datasets, as this is where the authors usually provide specifics about the datasets, including their sizes, characteristics, and any relevant splits (e.g., training, validation, testing).

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two key datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Sintel Dataset**: This dataset is used for optical flow evaluation and is known for its challenging scenes. The authors likely provide details about the specific splits they used (e.g., clean and final passes).

2. **KITTI Dataset**: Another well-known dataset in the field of optical flow and motion estimation, which is commonly used for benchmarking algorithms.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. It is crucial to provide accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For the **Sintel Dataset**, the citation is:
> Daniel Butler, Jonas Wulff, Garrett Stanley, and Michael Black. *A naturalistic open source movie for optical flow evaluation*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2012.

For the **KITTI Dataset**, the citation is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for Autonomous Driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2012.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
