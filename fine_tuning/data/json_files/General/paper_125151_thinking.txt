To extract datasets from the research paper titled "APPLeNet: Visual Attention Parameterized Prompt Learning for Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Generalization using CLIP" by Mainak Singha et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors curated four available remote sensing benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are included.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 4), where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four datasets:

1. **PatternNet**: This dataset comprises 38 classes, with each class containing 800 images of size 256 × 256 pixels.

2. **RSICD**: This dataset includes 30 classes and a total of 10,000 images, each with a size of 224 × 224 pixels. The number of images per class varies.

3. **RESISC45**: This dataset consists of 45 classes, with each class containing 700 images of size 256 × 256 pixels.

4. **MLRSNet**: This dataset comprises 46 classes and a total of 109,161 images, each with a size of 256 × 256 pixels.

The authors also mention that they curated new versions (v2) of these datasets, considering overlapping classes, but I will focus on the original datasets for citation purposes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **PatternNet**, the citation is:

- For **RSICD**, the citation is:

- For **RESISC45**, the citation is:
  > Gong Cheng, Junwei Han, and Xiaoqiang Lu. *Remote sensing image scene classification: Benchmark and state of the art*. Proceedings of the IEEE, 105(10):1865–1883, 2017.

- For **MLRSNet**, the citation is:

ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 169:337–350, 2020.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
