To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimal Training of Mean Variance Estimation Neural Networks" by Laurens Sluijterman et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the paper presents experimental results on "a number of benchmark UCI regression data sets," indicating that datasets are indeed used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.2 (Data sets and experimental procedure)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention that they compare their methods on several UCI benchmark datasets, specifically naming:

1. **Boston Housing Dataset**: A well-known dataset used for predicting housing prices based on various features.
2. **Energy Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting energy consumption based on historical data.
3. **Yacht Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the speed of yachts based on design features.
4. **Concrete Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the compressive strength of concrete mixtures.
5. **Wine Quality Red Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the quality of red wine based on physicochemical tests.
6. **Kin8nm Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting the behavior of a robotic arm.
7. **Protein Dataset**: A dataset used for predicting protein structure based on amino acid sequences.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. However, since these datasets are commonly known UCI datasets, I can provide their general citations based on their typical references:

- **Boston Housing Dataset**:

- **Protein Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
