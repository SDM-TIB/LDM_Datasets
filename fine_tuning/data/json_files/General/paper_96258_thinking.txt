To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physical Layer Network Coding in Network MIMO: A New Design for 5G and Beyond" by Tong Peng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper for specific datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for testing and validation. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

If the paper includes a **section dedicated to datasets**, I will examine it closely. This section often provides comprehensive details about the datasets, including how they were collected, their structure, and any preprocessing steps taken.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is necessary for academic integrity. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and any other relevant details for each dataset.

For this paper, I will look for datasets related to network MIMO systems, physical layer network coding, or any simulations conducted as part of the research. If the authors mention any publicly available datasets, I will note those as well.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their full citations, into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on the experiments/results sections for detailed dataset descriptions.
3. Check for a dedicated datasets section for comprehensive information.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references section for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information for review.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
