To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Probability Distribution and Location-aware ResNet Approach for QoS Prediction" by Wenyan Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on a real-world web service dataset called **WS-DREAM**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look into **section 3.2 (Experimental Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset used. They mention that the **WS-DREAM dataset** contains 1,873,838 available QoS values collected from 339 users on 5825 services. This section also describes the nature of the data, including response time and throughput values, which are essential for understanding the dataset's context.

In this section, the authors also reference the original source of the WS-DREAM dataset, which is attributed to Zheng et al. This is important for providing the full citation later.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the complete citation for the WS-DREAM dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Zheng, Y., Liu, Y., Zhang, Y., & Lyu, M. R. (2017). *WS-DREAM: A Dataset for Web Service QoS Prediction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), pp. 1-8.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will ensure to format this information clearly. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation in a structured manner for clarity and future reference.
