To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Green AI for Audio Deepfake Detection" by Subhajit Saha et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments with the **ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset**, which is a strong lead for dataset extraction.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the importance of datasets in audio deepfake detection. They mention that the ASVspoof challenge series provides publicly accessible datasets, which reinforces the relevance of the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors explicitly state that they utilized the **LA subset of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset** for their experiments. They provide details about the dataset, including its composition of 19 TTS and VC attacks, and how it is structured into training, development, and evaluation subsets. This section confirms the dataset's significance in their research.

Now, I will look for the **full citation** of the ASVspoof 2019 dataset in the **references section**. The relevant citation is:

- For **ASVspoof 2019 dataset**:
  > X. Wang et al., “ASVspoof 2019: A large-scale public database of synthesized, converted and replayed speech,” *Computer Speech & Language*, vol. 64, p. 101114, 2020.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference the **LibriSpeech dataset** as the source of audio data for training their pre-trained SSL model. I will also extract this dataset's citation.

- For **LibriSpeech dataset**:
  > V. Panayotov et al., “LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books,” in *Proc. ICASSP*, 2015.

Having identified and confirmed the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective citations.
