To extract datasets from the research paper titled "TABPFN: A Transformer that Solves Small Tabular Classification Problems in a Second" by Noah Hollmann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is evaluated on **18 datasets in the OpenML-CC18 suite** and **67 small numerical datasets from OpenML**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will look into **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their evaluation methodology. Here, they explicitly mention using datasets from the **OpenML-CC18 benchmark suite**. I will need to find the exact names of these datasets.

In **section 5.2**, the authors state that they used all datasets from the curated OpenML-CC18 benchmark suite that contain up to 2,000 samples, 100 features, and 10 classes. They specify that this set comprises **30 datasets**. I will need to extract the names of these datasets from the tables provided in the paper.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors refer to the OpenML datasets, which are publicly available, and I will need to ensure I have the correct references for these datasets.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **OpenML-CC18 Benchmark Suite**: This includes 30 datasets, which I will list out based on the information provided in the tables of the paper.

2. **Additional 67 small numerical datasets from OpenML**: The authors validate their results on these datasets, but I will need to check if they provide specific names or references for these datasets.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets. The OpenML datasets can be cited as follows:

- For the OpenML-CC18 benchmark suite, the citation is:
  > Bischl, B., Casalicchio, G., Feurer, M., Gijsbers, P., Hutter, F., Lang, M., Mantovani, R., van Rijn, J., & Vanschoren, J. (2021). OpenML benchmarking suites. In Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems Track on Datasets and Benchmarks.

- For the OpenML datasets, the citation is:
  > Vanschoren, J., van Rijn, J., Bischl, B., & Torgo, L. (2014). OpenML: Networked science in machine learning. SIGKDD Explorations, 15(2), 49-60.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately documented each dataset with its corresponding citation, ready for further processing or review.
