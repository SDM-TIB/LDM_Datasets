To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Computationally Identifying Funneling and Focusing Questions in Classroom Discourse" by Sterling Alic et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation and release of an annotated dataset of 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling and focusing questions. This indicates that a dataset is indeed present and provides a specific number of examples.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe the dataset as consisting of 2,348 examples of teacher-student exchanges sampled from elementary math classroom transcripts. The section also mentions that these exchanges were annotated by domain experts for the presence of funneling and focusing questions.

In this section, I will note the following key details about the dataset:

1. **Annotated Dataset of Teacher Utterances**: This dataset contains 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling, focusing, or neither. The authors explain that the dataset was created with the help of former and current math teachers and educators trained in classroom observation.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original source of the transcripts used to create the dataset. The authors mention that the transcripts were collected by the National Center for Teacher Effectiveness (NCTE) between 2010-2013, and they reference a study by Kane et al. (2015) for this information.

The citation for the dataset is as follows:
- **National Center for Teacher Effectiveness (NCTE) Dataset**: 
  > Kane, T., Hill, H., & Staiger, D. (2015). National Center for Teacher Effectiveness Main Study. ICPSR36095-v2.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

In summary, I have identified the following dataset:
- **Dataset Name**: Annotated Dataset of Teacher Utterances
- **Description**: Contains 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling, focusing, or neither, sampled from elementary math classroom transcripts.
- **Citation**: Kane, T., Hill, H., & Staiger, D. (2015). National Center for Teacher Effectiveness Main Study. ICPSR36095-v2.

After this, I will prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
