To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Secure and Differentially Private Bayesian Learning on Distributed Data" by Yeongjae Gil et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the application of the proposed method to logistic regression and survival analysis on distributed data, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors describe their empirical evaluations. In this section, they mention using specific datasets for their experiments. I will look for any dataset names, descriptions, and relevant details.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention two datasets:

1. **PhysioNet Challenge 2012 Dataset**: This dataset is used for binary classification to predict mortality. It consists of 4,000 subjects with various features derived from time-stamped measurements.

2. **FLchain Dataset**: This dataset is used for survival analysis, focusing on predicting mortality based on serum-free light chain levels. It contains 7,874 data points with 7 features.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **PhysioNet Challenge 2012 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Golberger, A.; Amaral, L.; Glass, L.; Hausdorff, J. M.; Ivanov, P. C.; Mark, R.; Mietus, J.; Moody, G.; Chung-Kan, P.; Stenley, H. PhysioBank, PhysioToolkit, and PhysioNet: Component of a New Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals. *Circulation* 2000, 101, e215–e220.

- For the **FLchain Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dispenzieri, A.; Kyle, R.; Merlini, G.; Miguel, J.; Ludwig, H.; Hajek, R.; Palumbo, A.; Jagannath, S.; Bladé, J.; Lonial, S., et al. International Myeloma Working Group guidelines for serum-free light chain analysis in multiple myeloma and related disorders. *Leukemia* 2009, 23, 215–224.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will facilitate further research and ensure that the datasets are correctly attributed in any future work.
