To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Divide-and-Conquer Classification Based on Feature-Space Decomposition" by Qi Guo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted on large-scale datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for tables or text that explicitly list the datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing **Table 3**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **news20**: This dataset has 1,355,191 features, with 17,997 training instances and 1,999 testing instances.
2. **RCV1**: This dataset contains 47,236 features, with 20,242 training instances and 677,399 testing instances.
3. **covtype**: This dataset has 54 features, with 464,810 training instances and 116,202 testing instances.
4. **census**: This dataset consists of 409 features, with 159,619 training instances and 39,904 testing instances.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The paper mentions that the datasets can be downloaded from specific sources, which is crucial for proper citation. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **news20**, the citation is:
  > "News20 dataset." Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
  
- For **RCV1**, the citation is:
  > "RCV1 dataset." Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
  
- For **covtype**, the citation is:
  > "Covtype dataset." Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
  
- For **census**, the citation is:
  > "Census dataset." Available at: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. Each dataset will be described with its name, characteristics, and full citation to ensure clarity and proper attribution.
