To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approach based on the Hadamard Transform for the Convolutional Layer" by Hongyi Pan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experimental results sections** to find any references to datasets. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on the **MNIST dataset**, **CIFAR-10**, and **ImageNet-1K**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of these datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experimental results, the authors describe their methodology for training on the **MNIST dataset** for handwritten digit classification, the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for image classification, and the **ImageNet-1K dataset** for a more extensive image classification task. Each dataset is used to evaluate the performance of their proposed HT-perceptron layer.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

2. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images used for image classification. The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

3. **ImageNet-1K Dataset**: The ImageNet dataset is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. The citation is:
   > Olga Russakovsky, Jia Deng, Hao Sheng, et al. *ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3):211-252, 2015.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
