To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing the Secrecy Rate with Direction-range Focusing with FDA and RIS" by Chu Li, Stefan Roth, and Aydin Sezgin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for simulations or experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and how they were utilized in the study.

If the paper includes a **results section**, I will check for any references to datasets that were analyzed or compared. This section may provide insights into how the datasets contributed to the findings of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like "XYZ Dataset" for their experiments, I will look for the full citation in the references, which might look something like:
> Author(s). *Title of the Dataset*. Year. URL or DOI if available.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I accurately represent the information as presented in the paper.

Finally, I will organize the extracted dataset information in a clear format for easy reference, making sure to highlight the importance of each dataset in the context of the research findings.
