To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploiting News Article Structure for Automatic Corpus Generation of Entailment Datasets" by Jan Christian Blaise Cruz et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created and released **NewsPH-NLI**, the first sentence entailment benchmark dataset in Filipino. This is a strong indication that a dataset is present.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** section, specifically **section 2.2**, where the authors describe the creation of the **NewsPH-NLI dataset** in detail. They mention that they scraped a total of **229,571 straight news articles** from major Philippine news sites and used these articles to generate premise-hypothesis pairs for the dataset. The dataset consists of **600,000 premise-hypothesis pairs**, with **420,000** for training and **80,000** each for validation and testing.

In addition to the **NewsPH-NLI dataset**, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors reference several works, but the primary dataset they created is **NewsPH-NLI**. 

The full citation for the **NewsPH-NLI dataset** is not explicitly provided in the references, but I can construct it based on the authors and the context given in the paper:

- **NewsPH-NLI Dataset**:
  > Cruz, J.C.B., Resabal, J.K., Lin, J., Velasco, D.J., and Cheng, C. *Exploiting News Article Structure for Automatic Corpus Generation of Entailment Datasets*. In Proceedings of the [Conference Name], [Year].

Since the paper does not specify the conference name or year, I will note that this information needs to be filled in based on the actual publication details.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **NewsPH-NLI Dataset**: A dataset created for Natural Language Inference in Filipino, consisting of 600,000 premise-hypothesis pairs generated from news articles.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation for the dataset is included, even if it requires additional details to be filled in later.
