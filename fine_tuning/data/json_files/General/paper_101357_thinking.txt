To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Now You See It, Now You Donâ€™t: Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Computational Pathology" by Alex Foote et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of deep learning models in computational pathology, which suggests that datasets are likely involved. I will look for any specific datasets mentioned.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the use of deep learning in various computational pathology tasks, hinting at the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will pay attention to any specific dataset names or references.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly the subsection titled "Tumour Cell Classification." Here, the authors mention using a subset of the **PanNuke dataset**, which contains patches of tissue images annotated for different cell classes. They specify that they used only the breast tissue subset and provide details about the number of positive and negative patches.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if there are any additional datasets mentioned or if the authors refer back to the PanNuke dataset in the context of their experiments.

Now, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citation for the PanNuke dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PanNuke dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gamper, J., Koohbanani, N.A., Graham, S., Jahanifar, M., Khurram, S.A., Azam, A., Hewitt, K., Rajpoot, N. *Pannuke dataset extension, insights and baselines*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.10778. (2020).

Since the paper primarily discusses the PanNuke dataset and does not mention any other datasets explicitly, I will focus on this dataset for my extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry with the necessary details, ensuring that the full citation is included for clarity and proper attribution. This will allow for a structured output that can be used for further analysis or reference.
