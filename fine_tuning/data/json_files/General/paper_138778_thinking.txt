To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Climate Activism 2024: Stance, Target and Hate Event Detection via Retrieval-Augmented GPT-4 and LLaMA" by Marek Å uppa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study focuses on hate speech detection and stance detection, which suggests that datasets related to these tasks may be included.

In the **introduction**, the authors reference the **ClimaConvo dataset (Shiwakoti et al., 2024)**, which is described as a novel multi-aspect dataset for climate activism. This is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the ClimaConvo dataset. They mention that it is used for the CASE 2024 Shared Task on Climate Activism Stance and Hate Event Detection. The dataset is divided into three subtasks, with specific class distributions for each subtask, which confirms its relevance and importance.

The authors also mention that the dataset was introduced in a paper by Shiwakoti et al. (2024), which I will need to cite properly. 

In addition to the ClimaConvo dataset, the authors reference other datasets in the introduction, such as:

1. **Climatebert Dataset**: A pretrained language model for climate-related text, cited as:
   > Webersinke, N., Kraus, M., Bingler, J. A., & Leippold, M. (2021). *Climatebert: A pretrained language model for climate-related text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.12010.

2. **Environmental Claims Dataset**: A dataset for detecting real-world environmental claims, cited as:
   > Stammbach, D., Webersinke, N., Bingler, J. A., Kraus, M., & Leippold, M. (2022). *A dataset for detecting real-world environmental claims*. Center for Law & Economics Working Paper Series, 2022(07).

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations:

1. **ClimaConvo Dataset**:
   > Shuvam Shiwakoti, Surendrabikram Thapa, Kritesh Rauniyar, Akshyat Shah, Aashish Bhandari, and Usman Naseem. (2024). *Analyzing the dynamics of climate change discourse on twitter: A new annotated corpus and multi-aspect classification*. Preprint.

2. **Climatebert Dataset**:
   > Webersinke, N., Kraus, M., Bingler, J. A., & Leippold, M. (2021). *Climatebert: A pretrained language model for climate-related text*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.12010.

3. **Environmental Claims Dataset**:
   > Stammbach, D., Webersinke, N., Bingler, J. A., Kraus, M., & Leippold, M. (2022). *A dataset for detecting real-world environmental claims*. Center for Law & Economics Working Paper Series, 2022(07).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clearly structured and ready for any further processing or review.
