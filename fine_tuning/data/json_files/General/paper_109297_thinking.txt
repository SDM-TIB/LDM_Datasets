To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ActFormer: A GAN-based Transformer towards General Action-Conditioned 3D Human Motion Generation" by Liang Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors introduce a new synthetic dataset for multi-person combat behaviors, which suggests that there are multiple datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the limitations of existing datasets and mention specific datasets they leverage, such as NTU RGB+D 120 and BABEL. This section provides context for the datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, particularly section 4.1, the authors explicitly list the datasets they used for evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **NTU RGB+D 120**: A large-scale dataset containing 114,480 motion clips across 120 action categories, including both single-person and multi-person actions.
2. **BABEL**: A dataset that provides fine-grained action labels on frame-level for AMASS, containing over 250 action categories.
3. **GTA Combat**: A newly constructed synthetic dataset of combat behaviors collected from the Grand Theft Auto V gaming engine, containing approximately 7,000 motion sequences of combat actions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **NTU RGB+D 120**, the citation is:
  > Jun Liu, Amir Shahroudy, Mauricio Perez, Gang Wang, Ling-Yu Duan, and Alex C. Kot. *NTU RGB+D 120: A large-scale benchmark for 3D human activity understanding*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 42(10):2684–2701, 2020.

- For **BABEL**, the citation is:
  > Abhinanda R. Punnakkal, Arjun Chandrasekaran, Nikos Athanasiou, Alejandra Quiros-Ramirez, and Michael J. Black. *BABEL: bodies, action and behavior with English labels*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 722–731, 2021.

- For **GTA Combat**, since it is a newly constructed dataset, the citation is:
  > Liang Xu, Ziyang Song, Dongliang Wang, Jing Su, Zhicheng Fang, Chenjing Ding, Weihao Gan, Yichao Yan, Xin Jin, Xiaokang Yang, Wenjun Zeng, and Wei Wu. *GTA Combat dataset*. Collected through the Grand Theft Auto V gaming engine, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or citations related to the datasets used in the research paper.
