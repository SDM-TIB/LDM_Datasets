To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging machine learning for less developed languages: Progress on Urdu text detection" by Hazrat Ali, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to get an overview of the research focus and any datasets that may be mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors have developed a dataset of scene images with Urdu text, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will examine **section 2 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset they created. Here, they describe a dataset consisting of **500 unique images** with Urdu text, recorded under various conditions. This section will likely contain the necessary details about the dataset, including its size, content, and how it was constructed.

In this section, the authors mention that the dataset includes images recorded at a resolution of **1080 Ã— 800** and that they manually cropped patches to create **7000+ text regions and 14000+ non-text regions**. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure and intended use.

After gathering the dataset details, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors state that the dataset can be requested by email, but they do not provide a formal citation for it. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is a unique contribution of this paper and will reference it accordingly.

The citation for the dataset will be formatted as follows:
> Hazrat Ali. *Leveraging machine learning for less developed languages: Progress on Urdu text detection*. In ML4D Workshop at 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset extracted from the paper.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing, ensuring that all relevant details are accurately captured.
