To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Pose-Guided Feature Learning with Knowledge Distillation for Occluded Person Re-Identification" by Kecheng Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the focus on occluded person re-identification and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation. The introduction will provide context and possibly mention specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used in **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**. Here, they list several datasets relevant to their research, which is crucial for my extraction.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Market-1501**: This dataset is widely used for person re-identification tasks, containing 1,501 identities and 19,732 gallery images.
2. **DukeMTMC-reID**: Another popular dataset with 1,404 identities and 16,522 training images.
3. **Occluded-Duke**: A dataset specifically designed for occluded person re-identification, derived from DukeMTMC-reID, containing 15,618 training images.
4. **Occluded-ReID**: This dataset consists of 2,000 images of 200 occluded persons, captured with a mobile camera.
5. **Partial-REID**: A dataset with 600 images from 60 individuals, focusing on partial person images.
6. **Partial-iLIDS**: This dataset includes 238 images from 119 individuals, also focusing on partial views.
7. **Partial-Duke**: A newly generated dataset by the authors, containing 702 identities and a mix of partial and holistic images.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing or review.
