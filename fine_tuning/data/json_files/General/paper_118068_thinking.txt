To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LinearCoFold and LinearCoPartition: Linear-Time Algorithms for Secondary Structure Prediction of Interacting RNA molecules" by He Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the algorithms and their applications, but I need to look for specific datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **results section**, particularly the subsection labeled **3. Results**. Here, the authors explicitly mention two datasets used for comparison:

1. **Meyer Dataset**: This dataset consists of 109 pairs of bacterial sRNA-mRNA sequences and 52 pairs of fungal snoRNA-rRNA sequences, with annotated ground truth of intermolecular base pairs. The combined sequence length ranges from 546 nt to 3,651 nt.

2. **TargetScan Dataset**: This dataset contains 16 miRNA-mRNA pairs sourced from the TargetScan database. The authors describe how they sampled 16 mRNA sequences and 16 miRNA sequences, resulting in pairs with combined sequence lengths ranging from 2,432 to 100,297 nt.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The Meyer dataset is referenced as being collected by Lai and Meyer, and the TargetScan dataset is attributed to a specific publication.

The citations I need to extract are:

- For the **Meyer Dataset**:
  > Lai, D., & Meyer, I. M. (2016). A comprehensive comparison of general RNAâ€“RNA interaction prediction methods. *Nucleic Acids Research*, 44, e61.

- For the **TargetScan Dataset**:
  > Agarwal, V., Bell, G. W., Nam, J. W., & Bartel, D. P. (2015). Predicting effective microRNA target sites in mammalian mRNAs. *eLife*, 4, e05005.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This process ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources as presented in the paper.
