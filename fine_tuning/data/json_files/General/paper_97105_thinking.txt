To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Efficient Transformer Decoder with Compressed Sub-layers" by Yanyang Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on 14 WMT machine translation tasks," which indicates that datasets related to WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) are likely involved. The introduction may provide further context or specific names of datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any preprocessing steps. In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their methods on "14 machine translation tasks (7 datasets)," specifically referring to WMT14 and WMT17 datasets. I will look for a table or a list that summarizes these datasets, which is often included in the experiments section.

Upon finding the relevant information, I will identify the datasets mentioned:

1. **WMT14 Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for English to German (En-De) and English to French (En-Fr) translations. The paper provides statistics about the number of sentences and words in this dataset.

2. **WMT17 Dataset**: Similar to WMT14, this dataset is also used for machine translation tasks, and the authors provide detailed statistics for various language pairs.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the WMT datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

For the WMT datasets, the citations are likely to be:

- For **WMT14**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, 2014.

- For **WMT17**:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2017). *Findings of the 2017 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, 2017.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all necessary details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
