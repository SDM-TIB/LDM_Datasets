To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PECAN: A Deterministic Certified Defense Against Backdoor Attacks" by Yuhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned. The abstract states that PECAN is evaluated on "image classification and malware detection datasets," which indicates that there are specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the paper, the authors explicitly mention three datasets used for evaluation: **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, and **EMBER**. 

1. **MNIST**: This is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 different classes of objects.
3. **EMBER**: This dataset is used for malware detection and contains 600,000 training examples and 200,000 test examples, with each example represented as a vector of features.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. URL: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.

- For **CIFAR10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. URL: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

- For **EMBER**, the citation is:
  > Anderson, H. S. and Roth, P. *EMBER: an open dataset for training static PE malware machine learning models*. CoRR, abs/1804.04637, 2018. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04637.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture all relevant details about the datasets used in the research.
