To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Jumping Ahead: Improving Reconstruction Fidelity with JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoders" by Senthooran Rajamanoharan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **"Experiments," "Evaluation," or "Datasets."** In this paper, I will focus on the **Evaluation section** where the authors discuss their experiments and the datasets used for training and evaluation.

In the **Evaluation section**, the authors mention that they evaluate their JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoders on **Gemma 2 9B activations**. This indicates that the dataset used for their experiments is the **Gemma 2 9B dataset**.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Gemma 2 dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the dataset.

The citation for the **Gemma 2 dataset** is:
> Gemini Team. *Gemma 2: Improving a practical open language model at size*. 2024. URL https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-2-report.pdf.

Having identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Dataset Name**: Gemma 2 9B
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of activations from the Gemma 2 9B model, which is used for training and evaluating the JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoders.
   - **Citation**: Gemini Team. *Gemma 2: Improving a practical open language model at size*. 2024. URL https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-2-report.pdf.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and ensure that the citation is complete and accurate for future use.
