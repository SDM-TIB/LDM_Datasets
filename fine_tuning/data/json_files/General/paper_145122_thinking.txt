To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MMIL: A novel algorithm for disease associated cell type discovery" by Erin Craig et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the application of the MMIL method to "clinically-annotated, primary patient samples in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)," indicating that datasets related to these diseases are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a dataset of "800 thousand cells collected from 13 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients and three healthy bone marrow controls." This is a clear indication of a dataset that I need to document.

Additionally, the authors describe another dataset consisting of "1.1 million blood and bone marrow cells collected from three Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) patients and three healthy controls." This is another dataset that I will need to include.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following sources:

1. For the AML dataset, the citation is:
   > Tsai, A. G., Glass, D. R., Juntilla, M., Hartmann, F. J., Oak, J. S., Fernandez-Pol, S., Ohgami, R. S., & Bendall, S. C. (2020). *Multiplexed single-cell morphometry for hematopathology diagnostics*. Nature Medicine, 26(3), 408–417. doi:10.1038/s41591-020-0783-x.

2. For the ALL dataset, the citation is:
   > Good, Z., Sarno, J., Jager, A., Aghaeepour, N., Simonds, E. F., White, L., Lacayo, N. J., Fantl, W. J., Fazio, G., Gaipa, G., Biondi, A., Tibshirani, R., Bendall, S. C., Nolan, G. P., & Davis, K. L. (2018). *Single-cell developmental classification of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis reveals predictors of relapse*. Nature Medicine, 24(4), 474–483. doi:10.1038/nm.4530.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, ready for structured output or further analysis.
