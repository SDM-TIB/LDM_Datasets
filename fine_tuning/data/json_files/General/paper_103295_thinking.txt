To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RIFLE: Robust Inference from Low Order Marginals" by Sina Baharlouei et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of missing values in datasets and mentions that RIFLE is evaluated on various datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any tables or figures that summarize the datasets, as they often provide concise information about dataset characteristics.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe their numerical experiments and mention several datasets, including:

1. **NHANES**: This dataset is noted for having varying percentages of missing values across different features. It is used to evaluate the performance of RIFLE in handling missing data.

2. **Super Conductivity Dataset**: This dataset contains 21,263 samples with 81 continuous features, and the task is to predict the critical temperature of superconductors.

3. **Blog Feedback Dataset**: This dataset consists of 280 features extracted from blog posts, and the task is to predict the number of comments in the upcoming 24 hours.

4. **Breast Cancer Dataset**: This dataset contains 198 instances and 34 features, used for evaluating imputation methods.

5. **Parkinson Dataset**: This dataset includes 193 records and 23 features, used for classifying individuals with Parkinson's disease.

6. **Spam Dataset**: This dataset consists of 4,602 instances and 57 attributes, used for spam detection.

7. **Housing Dataset**: The Boston Housing dataset contains 506 instances and 14 features, used for regression tasks.

8. **Clouds Dataset**: This dataset has 1,024 instances and 10 features, used for evaluating imputation methods.

9. **Drive Dataset**: This dataset consists of 49 continuous features extracted from electric current drive signals.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. The citations may not always be provided directly in the paper, but I will look for any references that discuss the datasets or their original sources.

For example, the NHANES dataset is often cited as:
> National Center for Health Statistics. *National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey*. [Link to dataset]

The Super Conductivity dataset can be cited as:
> Superconductivity Data. *UCI Machine Learning Repository*. [Link to dataset]

I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as I document them.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
