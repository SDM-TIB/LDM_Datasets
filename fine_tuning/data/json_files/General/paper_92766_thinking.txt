To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adaptive Braking for Mitigating Gradient Delay" by Abhinav Venigalla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet-1k**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets used, particularly in the **experiments or results sections**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments with **ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10** and **ResNet-50 on ImageNet-1k**. This confirms that both datasets are indeed utilized for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.

2. **ImageNet-1k**:
   > Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25 (pp. 1097-1105). Curran Associates, Inc.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, the datasets extracted from the paper are:
- **CIFAR-10** with citation: Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report.
- **ImageNet-1k** with citation: Krizhevsky, A., Sutskever, I., & Hinton, G. E. (2012). *Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks*. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25 (pp. 1097-1105). Curran Associates, Inc.
