To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sound Field Estimation Using Deep Kernel Learning Regularized by the Wave Equation" by David Sundstr√∂m et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and numerical experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but does not mention specific datasets. The introduction discusses the problem of sound field estimation but does not provide dataset details either.

Next, I will focus on the **numerical experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their simulation setup. Here, they mention using a microphone array consisting of 30 microphones placed randomly within a cube of side length 0.5 m. However, they do not specify a named dataset but rather describe the experimental setup.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited indirectly through the references. The references include various works related to sound field estimation and kernel methods, but they do not explicitly mention a dataset that is used in this paper.

Since the paper does not provide specific datasets with formal names or citations, I will note that the authors conducted numerical simulations based on a specific experimental setup rather than using publicly available datasets. 

In conclusion, I will summarize my findings:
- The paper does not mention any specific datasets by name.
- The experiments are based on a simulation setup rather than a publicly available dataset.
- No formal citations for datasets can be provided as none are referenced.

This approach ensures that I have thoroughly examined the paper for any datasets while adhering to the importance of providing full citations when applicable. Since no datasets were found, I will document this lack of dataset references in my final output.
