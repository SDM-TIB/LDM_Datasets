To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Brighten-and-Colorize: A Decoupled Network for Customized Low-Light Image Enhancement" by Chenxi Wang and Zhi Jin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on commonly used low-light image enhancement datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be listed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets and Implementation Details)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they specify:

1. **LOL-real Dataset**: This dataset consists of 689 pairs of low-/normal-light images for training and 100 pairs for testing. It is captured in real-world conditions by varying exposure time and ISO.

2. **MIT-Adobe-FiveK Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,000 raw images, each paired with five high-quality versions retouched by experts. The version retouched by expert C is used as the ground truth, with 4,500 training pairs and 500 testing pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **LOL-real Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wenhan Yang, Wenjing Wang, Haofeng Huang, Shiqi Wang, and Jiaying Liu. *Sparse gradient regularized deep retinex network for robust low-light image enhancement*. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 30 (2021), 2072–2086.

- For the **MIT-Adobe-FiveK Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Vladimir Bychkovsky, Sylvain Paris, Eric Chan, and Frédo Durand. *Learning photographic global tonal adjustment with a database of input/output image pairs*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. IEEE, 97–104, 2011.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations as required. This structured approach ensures that I capture all relevant information accurately and comprehensively.
