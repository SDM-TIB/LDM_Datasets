To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Augmenting emotion features in irony detection with Large language modeling" by Yucheng Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of the **SemEval-2018 Task 3 dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiment)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for irony detection. Here, they describe the **SemEval-2018 Task 3 dataset**, which consists of actual Twitter tweets, including both ironic and non-ironic examples. The training set contains 3,834 tweets, with a balanced distribution of ironic and non-ironic tweets.

The authors also mention that this dataset is widely used in irony detection and serves as a benchmark for comparison in their study. This confirms its significance in the context of their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the SemEval-2018 Task 3 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **SemEval-2018 Task 3 dataset**:
  > Cynthia Van Hee, Els Lefever, and Véronique Hoste. *SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony Detection in English Tweets*. In Proceedings of the 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, pages 39–50, New Orleans, Louisiana. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2018.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the SemEval-2018 Task 3 dataset, ensuring that it is ready for any structured output or further processing.
