To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Harmonized Multimodal Learning with Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models" by Guoli Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors present experimental results on "four benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are indeed included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section, which is often where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this paper, the **Experiments** section (specifically section 6) provides detailed information about the datasets.

I will extract the following datasets mentioned in the paper:

1. **PASCAL Dataset**: The paper describes this dataset as containing 1,000 images collected from 20 categories, with each image annotated with 5 caption sentences. The citation for this dataset is:
   > C. Rashtchian, P. Young, M. Hodosh, and J. Hockenmaier. "Collecting image annotations using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk." In NAACL HLT 2010 Workshop, 2010, pp. 139–147.

2. **Wikipedia Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,866 image-text pairs collected from Wikipedia articles, categorized into 10 semantic categories. The citation is:
   > N. Rasiwasia, J. C. Pereira, E. Coviello, G. Doyle, G. R. G. Lanckriet, R. Levy, and N. Vasconcelos. "A new approach to cross-modal multimedia retrieval." In Proc. ACM Int. Conf. Multimedia, 2010, pp. 251–260.

3. **TVGraz Dataset**: This dataset contains 2,058 image-text pairs collected from webpages retrieved by Google image search. The citation is:
   > I. Khan, A. Saffari, and H. Bischof. "TVGraz: Multi-modal learning of object categories by combining textual and visual features." In AAPR Workshop, 2009, pp. 213–224.

4. **MSCOCO Dataset**: This dataset includes 82,783 images with 80 labels, each annotated with 5 independent sentences. The citation is:
   > T.-Y. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. Hays, P. Perona, D. Ramanan, P. Dollár, and C. L. Zitnick. "Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context." In Proc. IEEE Eur. Conf. Comput. Vis., 2014, pp. 740–755.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will ensure that I format the information clearly and accurately for any downstream processing or review.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation for each dataset, ensuring that all necessary details are included for future reference.
