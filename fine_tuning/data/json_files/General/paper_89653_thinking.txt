To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Predicting Subjective Features of Questions of QA Websites using BERT" by Issa Annamoradnejad et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors used data gathered by the CrowdSource team at Google Research in 2019, which suggests that this is the primary dataset used in their study.

Next, I will examine **section III (Data)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the dataset. Here, they mention that the data was collected from various Q&A websites and consists of 6079 rows with 40 columns, focusing on 21 target quality labels related to questions. This section is crucial as it outlines the specifics of the dataset, including its size, structure, and the nature of the data collected.

In this section, the authors also describe the categories of questions included in the dataset, which are "Technology," "Stackoverflow," "Culture," "Science," and "Life arts." This information is important for understanding the context of the dataset.

I will also look for any references to the dataset in the **references section** to find the full citation. The authors mention the dataset was gathered by the CrowdSource team at Google Research, and I will need to locate the appropriate citation for this source.

The relevant citation for the dataset is:
> Google, “Google Question Challenge”, Kaggle, 2019, Accessed on: February 20, 2020 [Online], Available: kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required.

In summary, the key steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Analyzing section III (Data) for detailed descriptions of the dataset.
3. Locating the full citation in the references section.

With this information, I can now prepare the dataset entry for the output.
