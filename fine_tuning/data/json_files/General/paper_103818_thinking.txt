To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Violence Detection in Videos" by Praveen Tirupattur, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of publicly available datasets for classifier training and testing, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the author explicitly lists the datasets used in the research. This section is crucial as it provides detailed descriptions of each dataset.

1. **Violent Scene Dataset (VSD)**: This dataset is described as an annotated dataset for violent scene detection in Hollywood movies and videos from the web. It was introduced by Demarty et al. in the framework of the MediaEval benchmark initiative. The latest version, VSD2014, includes 31 Hollywood movies and 86 web video clips, with annotations for violent scenes.

2. **Fights Dataset**: Introduced by Nievas et al., this dataset is specifically created for evaluating fight detection systems. It consists of two parts: the "Hockey" part with 1,000 clips from NHL games and the "Movies" part with 200 clips from action movies.

3. **Data from the Web**: The author mentions using images downloaded from Google to develop color models for blood detection. This dataset is not formally cited as a standalone dataset but is mentioned as a source for training the blood feature descriptor.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing.

By following this methodical approach, I ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the research paper.
