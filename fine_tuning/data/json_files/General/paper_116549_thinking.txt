To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Domain Generalization - A Causal Perspective" by Paras Sheth et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the sections specifically dedicated to datasets**. The abstract mentions that the paper includes insights into benchmark datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be extracted.

Next, I will look for a dedicated section on datasets, which is likely to provide detailed descriptions. In this paper, **section 4 (Benchmark Datasets)** is where the authors summarize various datasets used in the context of domain generalization. I will carefully read through this section to identify each dataset mentioned.

The datasets listed in the paper include:

1. **CelebA**: A large-scale face attributes dataset containing 202,599 celebrity images with 40 attribute annotations.
2. **CK+**: The Extended Cohn-Kanade dataset, which contains 593 video sequences labeled for emotions.
3. **MNIST**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits with 70,000 instances.
4. **Colored MNIST (CMNIST)**: A synthetic dataset derived from MNIST, also containing 70,000 instances but with a different correlation between color and label.
5. **Chest X-Ray14**: A medical imaging dataset with 112,120 X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients.
6. **Human3.6M**: A dataset for 3D human pose estimation containing 3.6 million images.
7. **CUHK03**: A dataset for person re-identification with 14,097 images of 1,467 identities.
8. **WaterBirds**: A dataset for bird classification with approximately 5,000 images.
9. **Terra Incognita**: A dataset for animal classification with images from camera traps.
10. **PACS**: A dataset containing images across four domains (Photo, Art, Cartoon, and Sketch).
11. **OfficeHome**: A dataset representing images of the same object under different scenarios, with 9,985 images across 4 domains.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and will be formatted as follows:

- **CelebA**:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries along with their full citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
