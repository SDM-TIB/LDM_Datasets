To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Test-Time Embedding Normalization for Popularity Bias Mitigation" by Dain Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list three datasets:

1. **Gowalla**: This dataset is widely recognized in the recommendation systems field. The authors provide some statistics about it, such as the number of users, items, and interactions.

2. **Yelp2018**: Another well-known dataset used for evaluating recommendation systems. The authors also provide statistics similar to those for the Gowalla dataset.

3. **ML-10M**: This dataset is from the MovieLens project and is commonly used in recommendation research. The authors mention how they transformed explicit ratings into implicit feedback for this dataset.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the datasets mentioned, I will look for the following citations:

- For **Gowalla**, the citation is:
  > Cho, E., Myers, S. A., & Leskovec, J. (2011). Friendship and mobility: user movement in location-based social networks. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining (pp. 1082â€“1090).

- For **Yelp2018**, the citation is:
  > Yelp Dataset. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.yelp.com/dataset.

- For **ML-10M**, the citation is:
  > GroupLens Research. (n.d.). MovieLens 10M Dataset. Retrieved from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the information is organized and ready for any further processing or review.
