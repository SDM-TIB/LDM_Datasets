To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leveraging Sequence Models to Predict the Useful Life of Batteries" by Samuel Paradis and Michael Whitmeyer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used data on **124 batteries released by Stanford University**, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **data section** (section 2) in detail, as it is likely to contain specific information about the dataset. Here, the authors describe the dataset as consisting of **124 batteries**, each with data on various measurements such as temperature, voltage, current, and charge/discharge capacity over approximately **1000 cycles**. This section confirms the dataset's size and the nature of the data collected.

In the **results section**, the authors mention that they partitioned the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, which further emphasizes the dataset's importance in their experiments. They provide details on how they used the dataset for both classification and prediction tasks, which reinforces its relevance.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The authors reference the dataset as being associated with the paper by **Severson et al. (2019)**, which is crucial for proper citation.

The full citation for the dataset is:
> Severson, K., et al. *Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation*. Nature Energy, 4(2), 383-391, 2019.

I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as it is essential for proper attribution.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read the abstract and introduction to identify the dataset.
2. Analyze the data section for detailed information about the dataset.
3. Check the references for the full citation of the dataset.
4. Compile the findings, ensuring to include the full citation.

With this approach, I can effectively extract and document the dataset used in the research paper.
