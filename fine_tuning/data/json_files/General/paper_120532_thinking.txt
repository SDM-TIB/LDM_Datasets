To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Glancing Transformer for Parallel Sequence-to-Sequence Learning" by Lihua Qian et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might reference datasets used in related studies.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about their structure or purpose.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments:

1. **WMT14 Dataset**: This dataset is used for machine translation tasks, specifically for English to German and German to English translations. The paper states that it contains 4.5 million sentence pairs.

2. **WMT17 Dataset**: This dataset is also used for machine translation, specifically for English to Chinese and Chinese to English translations. The authors mention that it contains 20 million sentence pairs.

3. **Quora Question Pairs Dataset**: This dataset is used for paraphrase generation tasks. The authors note that it contains 145,000 pairs of questions.

4. **MS-COCO Dataset**: This dataset is used for image captioning tasks. The authors mention that they use the Karpathy split of the dataset, which contains 113,000 images.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **WMT14 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Bojar, O., et al. (2014). *Findings of the 2014 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation, pages 1–30.

- For the **WMT17 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Barrault, L., et al. (2017). *Findings of the 2017 Conference on Machine Translation*. In Proceedings of the Second Conference on Machine Translation, pages 1–14.

- For the **Quora Question Pairs Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Quora. (2017). *Quora Question Pairs Dataset*. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs.

- For the **MS-COCO Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Lin, T.-Y., et al. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will include the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary details are captured for future use or verification.
