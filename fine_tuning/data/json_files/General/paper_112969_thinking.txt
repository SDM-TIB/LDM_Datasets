To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SLOVA: Uncertainty Estimation Using Single Label One-Vs-All Classifier" by Bartosz Wójcik et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the SLOVA model on various tasks, which may imply the use of specific datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this section, the authors mention conducting experiments on **CIFAR-10**, **CIFAR-100**, and **SVHN** datasets. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific tasks or evaluations they are associated with.

I will also look for any additional datasets mentioned in the **related work** or **conclusion** sections, as authors sometimes reference datasets used in previous studies or benchmarks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

2. **CIFAR-100**:
   > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. Technical Report, 2009.

3. **SVHN**:
   > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, Andrew Y. Ng. *Reading Digits in Natural Images with Unsupervised Feature Learning*. In Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1–5, 2011.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
