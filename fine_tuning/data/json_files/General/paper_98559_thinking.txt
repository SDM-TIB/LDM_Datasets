To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Evaluation of Morphological Embeddings for the Russian Language" by Vitaly Romanov and Albina Khusainova, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper evaluates morphology-based word embeddings for various NLP tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Evaluation)**, particularly **subsection 4.1 (Data and Training Details)**, where the authors mention using the first 1GB of the unpacked Russian Wikipedia dump for training their models. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, in **subsection 4.3 (POS-Tagging)**, the authors refer to a dataset used for POS tagging, which is a subset of SynTagRus. They specify that this dataset contains 49,136 sentences and 458 unique POS tags. This dataset is crucial for understanding their evaluation of morphological embeddings.

In **subsection 4.5 (Named Entity Recognition)**, the authors mention using the Named_Entities_3 collection, which employs a BILUO tagging scheme. This dataset is also important for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Russian Wikipedia dump**, the citation is:
   > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia*. Available at: https://dumps.wikimedia.org

2. For the **SynTagRus dataset**, the citation is:
   > Boguslavsky, I. (2014). *SynTagRus–a Deeply Annotated Corpus of Russian*. In Les émotions dans le discours-Emotions in Discourse, 367–380.

3. For the **Named_Entities_3 collection**, the citation is:
   > Mozharova, V., & Loukachevitch, N. (2016). Two-stage approach in Russian named entity recognition. In 2016 International FRUCT Conference on Intelligence, Social Media and Web (ISMW FRUCT), 1–6.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
