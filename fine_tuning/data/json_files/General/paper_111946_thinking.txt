To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Networked Sensing in 6G Cellular Networks: Opportunities and Challenges" by Liang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing experiments or methodologies** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets in the body of the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any datasets or benchmarks that are critical for their research. If they mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

I will then examine the **methodology and results sections** to find explicit mentions of datasets used for experiments or evaluations. If the authors describe any datasets in detail, I will extract that information, including the purpose of the dataset, the number of samples, and any specific characteristics that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as I need to provide complete and accurate citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Wenzheng Zhang, Menglong Zhu, and Konstantinos G. Derpanis. *From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255, 2013.

If the paper discusses datasets related to 6G cellular networks, I will ensure to capture their names and citations accurately, such as:
- **Dataset Name**: 6G Sensing Dataset
- **Citation**: Liang Liu, Shuowen Zhang, Rui Du, Tony Xiao Han, and Shuguang Cui. *Networked Sensing in 6G Cellular Networks: Opportunities and Challenges*. IEEE Journal, 2023.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets and their citations into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their proper citations for future use or verification.
