To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FCN-Pose: A Pruned and Quantized CNN for Robot Pose Estimation for Constrained Devices" by Marrone Silvério Melo Dantas et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the problem and context, which may include references to datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of robot pose estimation and the need for datasets, but they do not mention specific datasets yet. I will then look into the **methodology section**, particularly the subsection labeled **A. Datasets**, where the authors describe their dataset generation process.

In this section, the authors state that they generated two new datasets to address the lack of public datasets for robot pose detection and segmentation. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **Keypoints Dataset**: This dataset is used for pose detection and consists of approximately 20,000 frames captured in a controlled environment with a UR5 robotic arm. The authors mention that they selected 1,000 frames for annotation to reduce overfitting.

2. **Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is created to support the keypoints dataset and includes segmentation masks for each keypoint and the full robot skeleton. Each sample image has nine masks generated, corresponding to the eight keypoints and one for the skeleton.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the authors created these datasets themselves and there are no public datasets cited, I will note that the datasets are original contributions of the authors.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the paper itself, as it is crucial for proper attribution.

The citation for the paper is:

Finally, I will summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the context and details necessary for understanding their significance in the research.
