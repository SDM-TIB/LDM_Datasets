To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New Convergence Aspects of Stochastic Gradient Algorithms" by Lam M. Nguyen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In many research papers, authors will describe the datasets used for their experiments in a specific section, often labeled as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup." This section typically contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

Once I locate the relevant section, I will extract the names and descriptions of each dataset. For example, if the authors mention using a dataset for training and testing their algorithms, I will note the dataset's name, the number of samples, and any specific features or attributes that are highlighted.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the original sources of the datasets. I will ensure to capture all necessary details such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For instance, if the paper mentions using the "MNIST dataset," I would look for its citation, which might be something like:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly documented with its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration or replication of the study.
