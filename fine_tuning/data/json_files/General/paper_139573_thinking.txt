To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SPC-NeRF: Spatial Predictive Compression for Voxel Based Radiance Field" by Zetian Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of representing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and mention the need for efficient datasets for training and testing. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Synthetic-NeRF**: This dataset is introduced by NeRF and consists of 8 computer-rendered scenes, with each scene containing 300 camera poses (100 for training and 200 for testing).

2. **Synthetic-NSVF**: This dataset includes 8 additional scenes rendered by a computer, featuring more complex textures and lighting conditions.

3. **Blended-MVS**: A synthetic multi-view stereo dataset that provides photo-realistic ambient light. The authors use a subset provided by NSVF.

4. **Tanks & Temples**: This dataset consists of real-world images captured at a resolution of 1920×1080. The authors utilize 5 specific scenes (Barn, Caterpillar, Family, Ignatius, Truch) for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **Synthetic-NeRF**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
