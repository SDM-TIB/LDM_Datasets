To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiresolution and Multimodal Speech Recognition with Transformers" by Georgios Paraskevopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained on the **How2 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for additional context about the dataset. The authors discuss the importance of multimodal input for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and mention that they evaluate their system on the **How2 database**. This reinforces the significance of this dataset in their experiments.

In the **experimental setup section**, the authors provide more details about the **How2 dataset**. They describe it as consisting of 300 hours of instructional videos sourced from YouTube, with transcriptions mined from YouTube subtitles. This section also specifies the train, development, and test splits used for their experiments, which are essential details for understanding the dataset's structure.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the **How2 dataset**. The relevant citation is:
> Ramon Sanabria, Ozan Caglayan, Shruti Palaskar, Desmond Elliott, Lo√Øc Barrault, Lucia Specia, and Florian Metze. *How2: a large-scale dataset for multimodal language understanding*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Visually Grounded Interaction and Language (ViGIL). NeurIPS, 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the **How2 dataset**, I will document this dataset in detail, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future reference or processing.
