To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gradient Attention Balance Network: Mitigating Face Recognition Racial Bias via Gradient Attention" by Linzhi Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on several datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed used in their research. The introduction further elaborates on the issue of racial bias in face recognition and hints at the datasets used for training and testing their proposed method.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) to identify specific datasets mentioned. In Section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they used the **BUPT-Balancedface**, **BUPT-Globalface**, and **RFW** datasets for their experiments. Here are the details I will extract:

1. **BUPT-Balancedface**: This dataset consists of faces from four races: Caucasians, Asians, Indians, and Africans, containing 1.3 million images of 28,000 celebrities, with about 7,000 identities per race.

2. **BUPT-Globalface**: This dataset contains 2 million images of 38,000 celebrities, with a racial distribution that reflects the real-world population.

3. **RFW (Racial Faces in the Wild)**: This dataset includes faces of four races: Caucasians, Asians, Indians, and Africans, with each subset containing about 10,000 images of 3,000 identities.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

- For **BUPT-Balancedface** and **BUPT-Globalface**, the citation is:
  > Mei Wang and Weihong Deng. *Mitigating bias in face recognition using skewness-aware reinforcement learning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 9319–9328, 2020.

- For **RFW**, the citation is:
  > Mei Wang, Yaobin Zhang, and Weihong Deng. *Racial faces in the wild: Reducing racial bias by information maximization adaptation network*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 692–702, 2019.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
