To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AFD-Net: Adaptive Fully-Dual Network for Few-Shot Object Detection" by Longyao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO**, indicating that these datasets are likely used in their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of few-shot object detection and reference the need for large-scale benchmarks, which reinforces the idea that they are using established datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly state that they evaluated their method on **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO** datasets. I will take note of any specific details provided about how these datasets were utilized, such as the number of classes or the specific splits used for training and testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers who may want to access these datasets.

1. **PASCAL VOC**: The citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2):303–338, 2010.

2. **MS COCO**: The citation is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 740–755, 2014.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and completeness. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
