To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neural Network Pruning with Residual-Connections and Limited-Data" by Jian-Hao Luo and Jianxin Wu, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss the effectiveness of their method on **ImageNet** and small datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2 (Pruning on Small-Scale Datasets)**, where the authors summarize the datasets used for their experiments. They mention four small datasets:

1. **CUB200-2011**: This dataset is used for fine-grained image categorization, specifically for birds. The authors note that it contains 5,994 training images and 2,000 validation images across 200 categories.

2. **Oxford Pets**: This dataset includes images of cats and dogs, with 3,680 training images and 3,669 validation images across 37 categories.

3. **Stanford Dogs**: This dataset consists of 12,000 training images and 8,580 validation images across 120 categories, focusing on various dog breeds.

4. **Stanford Cars**: This dataset contains 8,144 training images and 8,041 validation images across 196 categories, specifically for car models.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **CUB200-2011**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the field.
