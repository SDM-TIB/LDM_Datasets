To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "On Robustness and Bias Analysis of BERT-based Relation Extraction" by Luoqiu Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus on analyzing the generalization of a fine-tuned BERT model, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction may provide context or mention datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Task, Methods, and Datasets)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. Here, they explicitly mention two benchmark datasets used for evaluation:

1. **Wiki80**: This dataset is described as having 80 relations, each with 700 instances. It was generated using distant supervision and filtered through crowdsourcing to remove noisy annotations.

2. **TACRED**: This is a large-scale relation extraction dataset that covers 42 relation types and contains 106,264 sentences. Each sentence in this dataset has only one relation label.

The authors also mention that they constructed robust/de-biased test sets based on these datasets, which indicates their importance in the study.

To ensure I have the correct citations, I will check the **References section** of the paper for the full citations of these datasets:

- For **Wiki80**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, W., Lin, Y., Liu, Z., & Sun, M. (2017). Incorporating relation paths in neural relation extraction. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

- For **TACRED**, the citation is:
  > Zhang, Y., Zhong, V., Chen, D., Angeli, G., & Manning, C.D. (2017). Position-aware attention and supervised data improve slot filling. In Proceedings of EMNLP.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
