To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HLA Predictions from Long Sequence Read Alignments, Streamed Directly into HLAminer" by Ren√© L. Warren, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of long sequencing reads for predicting HLA signatures, which suggests that specific datasets may be involved, particularly those related to whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing.

Next, I will read through the **introduction** to gather more context about the datasets. The introduction mentions the use of long reads from various sequencing technologies, hinting that specific datasets may be referenced later in the paper.

In the **Methods section**, I will focus on the subsection titled **Data**. Here, the author explicitly lists the datasets used for the experiments. The paper mentions:

1. **ONT PromethION dataset for NA12878**: This dataset is associated with accession SRR10965087.
2. **ONT PromethION dataset for NA19240**: This dataset is associated with accession ERR2585115.
3. **PacBio CCS dataset for NA24385**: This dataset is associated with accession SRX5327410.

I will note the details provided for each dataset, including the sequencing technology and the specific accessions.

Next, I will check the **Results section** to confirm that these datasets were indeed used for the predictions and to see if there are any additional details or context provided about the datasets.

Finally, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution. I will look for any papers or resources that describe the datasets in detail.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Now, I will summarize the datasets and their citations:

1. **ONT PromethION dataset for NA12878**:
   - Citation: Warren, R.L. et al. (2012). Derivation of HLA types from shotgun sequence datasets. *Genome Med.*, 4, 95; doi: 10.1186/gm396.

2. **ONT PromethION dataset for NA19240**:
   - Citation: Warren, R.L. et al. (2012). Derivation of HLA types from shotgun sequence datasets. *Genome Med.*, 4, 95; doi: 10.1186/gm396.

3. **PacBio CCS dataset for NA24385**:
   - Citation: Warren, R.L. et al. (2012). Derivation of HLA types from shotgun sequence datasets. *Genome Med.*, 4, 95; doi: 10.1186/gm396.

With this structured approach, I will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the datasets from the paper.
