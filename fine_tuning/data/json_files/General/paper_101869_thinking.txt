To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Faster-LTN: a neuro-symbolic, end-to-end object detection architecture" by Francesco Manigrasso et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that experimental results were obtained on the **PASCAL VOC** and **PASCAL PART** benchmarks, indicating that these are the datasets used.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, they explicitly state that experiments were performed on the **PASCAL VOC 2010** and **PASCAL PART** datasets. The authors also mention the specific configurations and the number of classes involved in the experiments, which is crucial for understanding the context of the datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. For the **PASCAL VOC 2010** dataset, the citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K.I., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2010 (VOC2010) Results*. 

2. For the **PASCAL PART** dataset, the citation is:
   > Chen, X., Mottaghi, R., Liu, X., Fidler, S., Urtasun, R., Yuille, A. (2014). *Detect what you can: Detecting and representing objects using holistic models and body parts*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 1971â€“1978.

Having identified the datasets and their citations, I will now summarize the information for each dataset:

- **PASCAL VOC 2010**: A benchmark dataset for object detection that includes various object classes and is widely used for evaluating detection algorithms.
- **PASCAL PART**: A dataset that focuses on detecting parts of objects, providing a more detailed understanding of object structures.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
