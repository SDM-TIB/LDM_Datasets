To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A physics-informed and attention-based graph learning approach for regional electric vehicle charging demand prediction" by Haohao Qu et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the evaluation results are based on a dataset of **18,061 EV charging piles in Shenzhen, China**, which indicates that a specific dataset is being used.

Next, I will look for more detailed descriptions in the **evaluation preparation section**. Here, the authors provide information about the dataset, including the time period it covers (from **19 June to 18 July 2022**), the number of charging piles, and the organization of the data into different traffic zones. They mention that the data includes **pile occupancy (demands) and charging price**, updated every five minutes for **247 traffic zones**.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a mobile application and does not have a formal citation like a published dataset, I will note that it is based on real-time data from a mobile application providing charging pile availability.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: EV Charging Demand Dataset
   - **Description**: This dataset contains data from **18,061 EV charging piles** in Shenzhen, China, covering the period from **19 June to 18 July 2022**. It includes information on pile occupancy (demand) and charging prices, updated every five minutes across **247 traffic zones**.
   - **Source**: Data collected from a mobile application providing real-time availability of charging piles.

Since there is no formal citation for this dataset, I will note that it is based on the authors' own data collection efforts rather than a published dataset.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
