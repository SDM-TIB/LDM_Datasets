To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Making the Most of BERT in Neural Machine Translation" by Jiacheng Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses improvements in machine translation using a new framework, but it does not specify datasets. The introduction provides context about the use of pre-trained models but does not mention specific datasets either.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments Settings)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three specific datasets:

1. **WMT 2014 English-German**: The authors state that they used a subset of the WMT 2014 training corpus containing 4.5 million sentence pairs. This dataset is crucial for their evaluation.

2. **WMT 2014 English-French**: They also used a subset of the WMT 2014 training corpus that contains 36 million sentence pairs, which is another significant dataset for their experiments.

3. **WMT 2018 English-Chinese**: The training data for this task consists of 2.2 million sentence pairs extracted from the WMT 2018 dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the WMT datasets, as they are widely recognized benchmarks in the field of machine translation. Therefore, I will note that these datasets are publicly available and commonly used in research.

Now, I will compile the information for each dataset:

1. **WMT 2014 English-German**: 
   - Description: A subset of the WMT 2014 training corpus containing 4.5 million sentence pairs.
   - Citation: WMT 2014 dataset is publicly available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html.

2. **WMT 2014 English-French**: 
   - Description: A subset of the WMT 2014 training corpus containing 36 million sentence pairs.
   - Citation: WMT 2014 dataset is publicly available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt14/translation-task.html.

3. **WMT 2018 English-Chinese**: 
   - Description: Training data consisting of 2.2 million sentence pairs extracted from WMT 2018.
   - Citation: WMT 2018 dataset is publicly available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/translation-task.html.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately documented the datasets and their citations, ready for any further processing or review.
