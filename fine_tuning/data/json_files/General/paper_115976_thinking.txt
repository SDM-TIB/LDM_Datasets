To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RVSL: Robust Vehicle Similarity Learning in Real Hazy Scenes Based on Semi-supervised Learning" by Wei-Ting Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of vehicle re-identification (ReID) in hazy conditions and hints at the use of both synthetic and real-world datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation Protocols)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Vehicle-1M**: This dataset is noted for containing a large number of vehicle images, specifically 23026 images for training and 1000 images for testing. It is used for both synthetic and real-world haze scenarios.

2. **VERI-Wild**: This dataset is also highlighted, containing 19532 images for training and 389 images for testing. It is similarly utilized in the context of vehicle ReID under hazy conditions.

In this section, the authors provide details about how they prepared the datasets, including the splitting of images into training, probe, and gallery sets, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's structure.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets:

- For **Vehicle-1M**, the citation is:
  > Lou, Y., Bai, Y., Liu, J., Wang, S., & Duan, L. (2019). *VERI-Wild: A large dataset and a new method for vehicle re-identification in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 3235–3243.

- For **VERI-Wild**, the citation is:
  > Liu, Y., Wang, Y., & Huang, T. (2016). *Deep relative distance learning: Tell the difference between similar vehicles*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 2167–2175.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference.
