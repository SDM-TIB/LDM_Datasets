To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Texture Generation Using A Graph Generative Adversarial Network And Differentiable Rendering" by Dharma KC et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a dataset for training and evaluation, which indicates that there are datasets involved. I will look for specific names and descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of generating textures for 3D mesh models and mention the use of the **ShapeNet dataset** for training and evaluation. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** to confirm the details about the ShapeNet dataset. The authors specify that the ShapeNet dataset consists of 3,514 3D mesh models of cars, with a breakdown of how many were used for training, validation, and testing. This detailed description will help me provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

I will also look at the **references section** to find the full citation for the ShapeNet dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Chang, A.X., Funkhouser, T., Guibas, L., Hanrahan, P., Huang, Q., Li, Z., Savarese, S., Savva, M., Song, S., Su, H., et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the information:

1. **ShapeNet Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,514 3D mesh models of cars, which were used for training, validation, and testing in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents the dataset and its citation, ensuring that it is ready for further processing or review.
