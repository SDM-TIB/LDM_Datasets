To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Automatic Image Content Retrieval Method for better Mobile Device Display User Experiences" by Alessandro Bruno, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of the **ImageNet repository** for semantic category classification, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will check the **introduction** for any additional details about datasets. The introduction discusses the mobile application and its functionalities but does not explicitly mention other datasets.

Moving on to the **methodology and experimental results sections**, I will look for any specific datasets used for training and testing the image classification system. In the experimental results section, it is stated that the training set consists of **1000 images, with 100 images for each of the ten image classes**. The classes include flowers, baby, dog, car, painting, bicycle, bird, bottle, lamp, fish, and no-class. However, the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for these images, only that they were taken from the internet.

I will also check the **references section** for any citations related to datasets. The references include links to sources like the **ImageNet** website, which is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks. The citation for ImageNet is:
> ImageNet. *http://www.image-net.org/index*.

Since the paper does not provide a specific dataset name for the 1000 images used in the training set, I will note that the images were sourced from the internet without a specific citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries based on the information gathered:

1. **ImageNet**: This dataset is used for semantic category classification in the mobile application. It is a large-scale dataset commonly used in image classification tasks.

2. **Custom Dataset**: A training set composed of 1000 images (100 for each of the ten classes) sourced from the internet. However, no specific citation is provided for this dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citations for the datasets, especially for ImageNet, and summarize the findings for clarity. The entries will be structured accordingly for further processing.
