To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DetNAS: Backbone Search for Object Detection" by Yukang Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) for object detection and mentions the effectiveness of DetNAS on various detectors and datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors mention using **COCO** and **PASCAL VOC** datasets for their experiments. I will look for specific details about these datasets, such as their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experimental settings section**, the authors provide additional context about how they split the datasets for training, validation, and testing. They mention that for COCO, the validation set consists of 5,000 images randomly selected from the trainval35k dataset, and for VOC, the validation set contains 5,000 images from trainval2007 and trainval2012. This information is crucial for understanding how the datasets were utilized.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **COCO Dataset**: The citation for the COCO dataset is:
   > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr Dollár, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

2. **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: The citation for the PASCAL VOC dataset is:
   > M. Everingham, S. A. Eslami, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge: A Retrospective*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, 2015.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **COCO Dataset**: A large-scale dataset for object detection, segmentation, and captioning, consisting of images with complex scenes containing multiple objects.
- **PASCAL VOC Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for object detection and segmentation, containing images with annotated objects across various categories.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately represented for future reference or processing.
