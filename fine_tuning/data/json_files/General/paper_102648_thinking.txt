To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Relevance Learning for Few-Shot Object Detection" by Weijie Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that comprehensive experiments were conducted on the **Pascal VOC** and **MS-COCO** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments** section. I will check for any subsections that explicitly discuss the datasets used, such as a section titled "Datasets" or similar. In this case, the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, but the experiments section provides enough context to confirm the datasets used.

In the **experiments** section, the authors describe their experimental setups on **Pascal VOC 2007, 2012** and **MS-COCO 2014** datasets. They mention that the Pascal VOC dataset consists of 20 object categories, with some classes designated as base classes and others as novel classes for few-shot detection tasks. The MS-COCO dataset contains 80 categories, with 20 of them being considered novel classes for the experiments.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **Pascal VOC Dataset**: The citation is:
   > M. Everingham, L. Gool, C. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. In International Journal of Computer Vision, 2010, pp. 303-338.

2. **MS-COCO Dataset**: The citation is:
   > T. Lin, M. Maire, S. Belongie, J. H. Girshick, and S. F. P. Dollar. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014, pp. 740-755.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
