To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Closer Look at the Adversarial Robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models" by Zonghan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **CIFAR-10 dataset** for their experiments. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including its purpose in the context of the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, I will look for the original paper or source that describes it.

The citation for the CIFAR-10 dataset is:
> Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical report, Citeseer, 2009.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that the extracted information is accurate and ready for any further processing or review.
