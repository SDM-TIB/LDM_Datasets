To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convergence Analysis for Training Stochastic Neural Networks via Stochastic Gradient Descent" by Richard Archibald et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets used for validation or experiments. If the authors mention any datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their numerical experiments. I will look for specific sections that detail the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any characteristics that are relevant to the study.

In this paper, the authors mention using the **MNIST handwritten dataset** and the **Fashion-MNIST dataset** for their experiments. I will take note of these datasets, including any details provided about their use in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998.

For the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
> Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Ludwig Strub. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation.

This systematic approach ensures that I accurately extract and document the datasets used in the research paper, providing a clear reference for future research or applications.
