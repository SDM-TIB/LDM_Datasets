To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WOT-Class: Weakly Supervised Open-world Text Classification" by Tianle Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **7 popular text classification datasets**, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they provide a table (Table 1) summarizing the datasets, which includes the following details:

1. **AGNews**: A news dataset with 12,000 documents and 4 classes.
2. **20News**: Another news dataset with 17,871 documents and 5 classes.
3. **NYT-Small**: A smaller dataset from the New York Times with 13,081 documents and 5 classes.
4. **NYT-Topics**: A dataset with 31,997 documents and 9 classes.
5. **NYT-Locations**: A dataset with 31,997 documents and 10 classes.
6. **Yahoo**: A question-answering dataset with 18,000 documents and 10 classes.
7. **DBpedia**: An ontology categorization dataset with 22,400 documents and 14 classes.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The authors reference several foundational papers related to these datasets, which I will need to include in my citations.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, along with their respective citations for further reference.
