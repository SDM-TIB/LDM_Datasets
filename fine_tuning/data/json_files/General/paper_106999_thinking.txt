To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-shot Learning with Multilingual Generative Language Models" by Xi Victoria Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract highlights the training of multilingual generative language models on a diverse corpus, which suggests that there may be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **XStoryCloze**: A new dataset created by translating the validation split of the English StoryCloze dataset into 10 other languages. This dataset is used for evaluating commonsense reasoning in a multilingual context.

2. **XCOPA**: A multilingual dataset for causal commonsense reasoning, which is referenced multiple times throughout the experiments.

3. **XWinograd**: Another dataset used for evaluating anaphora resolution in a multilingual setting.

4. **XNLI**: A well-known dataset for cross-lingual natural language inference, which is also utilized in the experiments.

5. **PAWS-X**: A cross-lingual dataset for paraphrase identification, mentioned in the context of evaluating few-shot learning capabilities.

Next, I will check the **References section** of the paper to gather full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

The full citations I find are:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations from the research paper.
