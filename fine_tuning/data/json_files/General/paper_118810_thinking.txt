To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Variational Augmentation for Enhancing Historical Document Image Binarization" by Avirup Dey et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluated their framework on a range of DIBCO datasets, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for understanding their research.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** and **section 4 (Experimental Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for training and evaluation. In section 4.1, they list the datasets used for training the binarization network, which includes:

1. **DIBCO 2009**: This dataset is part of the DIBCO (Document Image Binarization Contest) series and is used for evaluating document image binarization methods.
2. **DIBCO 2010**: Another dataset from the DIBCO series, used similarly for benchmarking binarization techniques.
3. **DIBCO 2011**: Continues the trend of providing datasets for evaluating document image binarization.
4. **DIBCO 2013**: This dataset is also part of the DIBCO series, contributing to the evaluation of binarization methods.
5. **DIBCO 2017**: The latest dataset mentioned for training purposes.

For evaluation, the authors mention using the following datasets in section 4.1:

1. **DIBCO 2014**: Used for testing the performance of their proposed method.
2. **DIBCO 2016**: Another dataset for evaluation.
3. **DIBCO 2018**: Included in the evaluation phase.
4. **DIBCO 2019**: The last dataset mentioned for testing.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The DIBCO datasets are typically referenced in the context of their respective contest papers. Here are the citations I will extract:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing or review.
