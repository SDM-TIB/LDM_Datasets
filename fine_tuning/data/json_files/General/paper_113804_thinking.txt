To extract datasets from the research paper titled "FashionViL: Fashion-Focused Vision-and-Language Representation Learning" by Xiao Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors propose a novel framework for fashion-focused vision-and-language representation learning, which suggests that they likely utilize specific datasets related to fashion. 

Next, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. Here, the authors discuss the unique characteristics of fashion data and the need for specialized datasets, which indicates that they may list specific datasets later in the paper.

I will then navigate to **section 4.1 (Pre-training dataset and downstream tasks)**, where the authors provide detailed statistics about the datasets used for pre-training. They mention four datasets:

1. **FashionGen**: This dataset contains 1.35 million image-text pairs derived from 373.5k fashion products.
2. **FACAD**: This dataset includes 171k products and 18k image-text pairs.
3. **Fashion200K**: This dataset consists of 164.5k products and 18k image-text pairs.
4. **PolyvoreOutfits**: This dataset has 72k products and 14.5k image-text pairs.

In this section, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets, including the number of products and pairs, which is crucial for understanding the scale of the datasets.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are essential for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. 

The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- **FashionGen**: 
  > Rostamzadeh, N., Hosseini, S., Boquet, T., Stokowiec, W., Zhang, Y., Jauvin, C., & Pal, C. (2018). *Fashion-gen: The generative fashion dataset and challenge*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.08317.

- **FACAD**: 
  > Huang, P.X., Wu, Z., Han, X., & Davis, L.S. (2018). *FACAD: A dataset for fashion image captioning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

- **Fashion200K**: 
  > Han, X., Wu, Z., Huang, P.X., Zhang, X., Zhu, M., Li, Y., Zhao, Y., & Davis, L.S. (2017). *Automatic spatially-aware fashion concept discovery*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

- **PolyvoreOutfits**: 
  > Lin, Y.L., Tran, S., & Davis, L.S. (2020). *Fashion outfit complementary item retrieval*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

After gathering the dataset names and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and easily accessible for future reference or research.
