To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Segment Anything for comprehensive analysis of grapevine cluster architecture and berry properties" by Efrain Torres-Lomas et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study involves segmenting approximately 3,500 cluster images and generating over 150,000 berry masks. This suggests that there is a dataset related to grape cluster images and berry segmentation.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, which provides detailed information about the datasets used. Here, the authors describe the plant material and imaging setup, indicating that they used images from an F1 mapping population derived from crossing Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling. This population consists of 139 genotypes, which is significant for the dataset.

In the **Results** section, the authors mention that they processed 3,431 cluster images and generated 215,090 masks. This reinforces the existence of a dataset related to grape cluster images and berry segmentation.

Now, I will compile the datasets identified:

1. **Grapevine Cluster Image Dataset**: This dataset consists of images obtained from an F1 mapping population (n=139 genotypes) derived from crossing Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling. The dataset includes 3,431 cluster images captured at various angles.

2. **Berry Masks Dataset**: This dataset includes the segmentation masks generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for individual berries within the cluster images. A total of 215,090 masks were generated, with 153,939 identified as true berry masks after filtering.

Next, I will check the **References section** for full citations related to the datasets. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, as they are derived from the authors' own research. Instead, I will note the relevant details about the F1 mapping population and the imaging methods used.

The relevant citations for the foundational model (SAM) and its application in this study are:

- Kirillov A, Mintun E, Ravi N, Mao H, Rolland C, Gustafson L, et al. *Segment Anything*. arXiv [cs.CV]. 2023. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643.

Now, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and relevant citations:

1. **Grapevine Cluster Image Dataset**:
   - Description: Images obtained from an F1 mapping population (n=139 genotypes) derived from crossing Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling. The dataset includes 3,431 cluster images captured at various angles.
   - Citation: Not applicable (derived from the authors' research).

2. **Berry Masks Dataset**:
   - Description: Segmentation masks generated by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for individual berries within the cluster images. A total of 215,090 masks were generated, with 153,939 identified as true berry masks after filtering.
   - Citation: Kirillov A, Mintun E, Ravi N, Mao H, Rolland C, Gustafson L, et al. *Segment Anything*. arXiv [cs.CV]. 2023. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02643.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
