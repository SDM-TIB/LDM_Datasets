To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BanglaNLG and BanglaT5: Benchmarks and Resources for Evaluating Low-Resource Natural Language Generation in Bangla" by Abhik Bhattacharjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors aggregate six conditional text generation tasks under the BanglaNLG benchmark, which suggests multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Bangla Natural Language Generation (BanglaNLG) Benchmark)**, where the authors describe the six tasks and their corresponding datasets. The tasks listed are:

1. **Machine Translation (MT)**: The dataset used is the **BanglaNMT parallel corpus**, which contains 2.75 million parallel pairs for training.
2. **Text Summarization (TS)**: The dataset for this task is the **Bangla portion of XL-Sum**, which is a large dataset for abstractive summarization.
3. **Question Answering (QA)**: The dataset used is **BQA**, which is derived from SQuAD 2.0 and includes unanswerable questions.
4. **Multi-turn Dialogue (MTD)**: A new dataset curated by translating the **DailyDialog** dataset into Bangla.
5. **News Headline Generation (NHG)**: This task repurposes the **XL-Sum** dataset, which includes article titles.
6. **Cross-lingual Summarization (XLS)**: The dataset used is the **CrossSum** dataset, which aligns articles in different languages.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm the use of these datasets for their evaluations, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

1. **BanglaNMT**: The citation is:

Sohel Rahman, and Rifat Shahriyar. *Not low-resource anymore: Aligner ensembling, batch filtering, and new datasets for Bengali-English machine translation*.

5. **CrossSum**: The citation is:

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their details from the paper.
