To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffuser: Efficient Transformers with Multi-hop Attention Diffusion for Long Sequences" by Aosong Feng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, experiments, and related work sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their model on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, they mention using datasets for language modeling, image modeling, and the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark. This indicates that multiple datasets are likely discussed.

I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments subsection**. The authors detail their evaluation on three language modeling datasets: **Books**, **CC-News**, and **Wikipedia**. They provide statistics for these datasets, which confirms their use.

Additionally, they introduce two new datasets for long document classification based on Amazon product reviews: **Amazon-512** and **Amazon-2048**. The statistics for these datasets are also provided, which is crucial for understanding their characteristics.

For the question answering tasks, the authors mention using **WikiHop** and **TriviaQA** datasets, providing detailed statistics for both. This further confirms the presence of multiple datasets.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and cited according to the paper's references. This structured approach will ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations effectively.
