To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fast Certified Robust Training with Short Warmup" by Zhouxing Shi et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention achieving results on **CIFAR-10** and **TinyImageNet**, which indicates that these datasets are likely used in their experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly state that they adopt three datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR-10**, and **TinyImageNet**. 

1. **MNIST**: This dataset is a well-known benchmark for handwritten digit recognition, consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). 

2. **CIFAR-10**: This dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is commonly used for image classification tasks.

3. **TinyImageNet**: This dataset is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, containing 100,000 images across 200 classes, with each class having 500 training images.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *MNIST handwritten digit database*. ATT Labs [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist, 2010.

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Technical Report TR-2009, 2009.

- For **TinyImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Yuxin Wu and Kaiming He. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS231N, 2015. Available: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing.
