To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multi-fidelity Bayesian Optimization in Engineering Design" by Bach Do and Ruda Zhang, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often highlights key datasets used in the research.

Next, I will look for specific sections that typically contain dataset information, such as **section 2 (Multi-fidelity optimization)** and **section 4 (Gaussian process-based multi-fidelity surrogates)**. These sections are likely to detail the datasets used for experiments and their characteristics.

In section 2, the authors discuss various multi-fidelity optimization strategies, but I need to confirm if they mention specific datasets. In section 4, I will look for any references to datasets used for training or validation of the models discussed.

If the datasets are not explicitly named in these sections, I will check the **experiments or results sections** for any references to datasets used in the experiments. The authors may describe the datasets in terms of their application or the results obtained from them.

Once I identify the datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations from the **References section** of the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used.

For example, if the authors mention using a dataset like the "Penn Action Dataset," I will look for its citation in the references, which might read something like:
> Zhang, W., Zhu, M., & Derpanis, K. G. (2013). From Actemes to Action: A Strongly-Supervised Representation for Detailed Action Understanding. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 2248â€“2255.

After gathering all relevant datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methods sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Focus on sections discussing multi-fidelity optimization and Gaussian process surrogates.
3. Check the experiments/results sections for additional dataset information.
4. Retrieve full citations from the references for each identified dataset.
5. Compile the dataset information for clarity and future use.
