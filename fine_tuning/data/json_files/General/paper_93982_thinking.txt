To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Enhancing SUNNY for Algorithm Selection" by Tong Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work and may highlight key datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will look for any specific names of datasets, their characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

In this paper, the authors mention the **ASlib benchmarks** as a significant dataset for comparing algorithm selection systems. I will note this down as it is a central dataset for their work.

Additionally, I will check the **appendices** for any supplementary information regarding datasets. The paper includes an appendix detailing the composition of OASC scenarios, which may provide further insights into the datasets used.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about the datasets, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, the ASlib benchmark dataset citation is:
- Bischl, B., Kerschke, P., Kotthoﬀ, L., Lindauer, M., Malitsky, Y., Fréchette, A., . . . Vanschoren, J. (2016). ASlib: A benchmark library for algorithm selection. *Artificial Intelligence*, 237, 41–58.

I will also look for any other datasets mentioned in the context of specific scenarios or experiments, ensuring to document their full citations as well.

Finally, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately capturing the relevant datasets from the paper.
