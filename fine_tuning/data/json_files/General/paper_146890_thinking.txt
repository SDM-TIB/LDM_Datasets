To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HSFusion: A high-level vision task-driven infrared and visible image fusion network via semantic and geometric domain transformation" by Chengjie Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental validation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, but I need to look for specific dataset names and details in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of infrared and visible image fusion but do not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the **experimental validation section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their methods.

In **section 4.1 (Experimental Details)**, the authors explicitly mention the **FMB dataset**. They describe it as containing image pairs of infrared images, visible images, and semantic segmentation labels. The training set includes 1,220 image pairs, and the test set contains 280 image pairs. This is a clear indication of a dataset that is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the FMB dataset. However, the paper does not provide a specific reference for the FMB dataset, which is common for datasets that are either publicly available or created by the authors themselves. In this case, I will note that the dataset is referenced as follows:

- **FMB Dataset**: The authors do not provide a formal citation, but it is described in the paper as containing infrared and visible image pairs along with semantic segmentation labels.

Since the dataset is not formally cited in the references, I will document it as described in the paper.

Now, I will compile the dataset entry based on the information gathered. The dataset entry will include the name, description, and any relevant details about the dataset, including the number of image pairs in the training and test sets.

After completing this process, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
