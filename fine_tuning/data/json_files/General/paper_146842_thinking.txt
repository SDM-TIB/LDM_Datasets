To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Pedestrian Attribute Recognition" by Xiao Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on multiple pedestrian attribute recognition benchmark datasets. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to look for.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metric)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **PA100K**: This dataset contains 100,000 pedestrian images and 26 binary attributes. The authors mention that they split the dataset into a training set of 90,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

2. **PETA**: This dataset consists of 19,000 pedestrian images with 61 binary attributes, divided into training, validation, and test subsets.

3. **RAP-V1**: This dataset includes 41,585 pedestrian images and 69 binary attributes, with a specified number of images used for training.

4. **RAP-V2**: Similar to RAP-V1, this dataset has 84,928 pedestrian images and 69 binary attributes, with a specified training set.

5. **WIDER**: This dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets, containing a total of 14 attribute labels.

6. **PETA-ZS**: A zero-shot version of the PETA dataset, with specified training, validation, and test sets.

7. **RAP-ZS**: A zero-shot version of the RAP dataset, with specified training, validation, and test sets.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review.
