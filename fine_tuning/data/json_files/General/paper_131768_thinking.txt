To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding the Impact of Post-Training Quantization on Large Language Models" by Somnath Roy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but I need to look for specific datasets in the main body of the paper.

In the **introduction**, the author references several datasets used for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the introduction mentions datasets such as **Wiki**, **PTB**, and **C4** as foundational datasets during the training of most LLMs. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any additional details about these datasets. The experiments section outlines the models and prompts used, but it also confirms that the perplexity scores were computed on the aforementioned datasets. This reinforces their significance in the context of the research.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with sources for further exploration.

1. **Wiki Dataset**: The citation for the Wiki dataset is:
   > "Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia." [Online]. Available: https://www.wikipedia.org/

2. **Penn Treebank (PTB)**: The citation for the Penn Treebank is:
   > Marcus, M., Santorini, B., & Marcinkiewicz, M. A. (1993). "Building a large annotated corpus of English: The Penn Treebank." *Computational Linguistics*, 19(2), 313-330.

3. **C4 Dataset**: The citation for the C4 dataset is:
   > Raffel, C., Shazeer, N., Roberts, A., Lee, K., Narang, S., Matena, M., Zhou, Y., Li, W., & Liu, P. J. (2020). "Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer." *The Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 21(1), 5485-5551.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for understanding the context and validity of the findings presented in the paper.
