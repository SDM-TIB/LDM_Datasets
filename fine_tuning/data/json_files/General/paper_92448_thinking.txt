To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Langevin Dynamics for Adaptive Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Stochastic Gradient Algorithms" by Vikram Krishnamurthy and George Yin, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

In this paper, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, such as "adult a9a dataset" or any other datasets used for experiments. I will also check if the authors provide any references or citations for these datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions the "adult a9a dataset," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation typically includes the authors, title, source, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, making sure to include all relevant details for each dataset extracted from the paper.
