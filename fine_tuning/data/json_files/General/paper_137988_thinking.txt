To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffuse to Choose: Enriching Image Conditioned Inpainting in Latent Diffusion Models for Virtual Try-All" by Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive testing on both in-house and publicly available datasets, which suggests that there are specific datasets that need to be identified.

Next, I will examine **section 4.1 (Dataset and Implementation Details)**, where the authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **In-house training dataset**: This dataset consists of 1.2 million source-reference pairs of product images. The authors explain that they collected these images to ensure that the reference images (xr) and source images (xs) are suitable for the Virtual Try-All task.

2. **VITON-HD-NoFace**: This is a publicly available dataset that has been modified to remove and crop all model faces from the images. The authors state that this dataset provides reference images against a white background, masks, and source images where individuals (with removed faces) are wearing the reference images.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **VITON-HD-NoFace** dataset, the citation is:
  > Seunghwan Choi, Sunghyun Park, Minsoo Lee, and Jaegul Choo. *VITON-HD: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 14131â€“14140, 2021.

The in-house dataset does not have a formal citation since it is not publicly available, but I will note its significance in the context of the research.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the VITON-HD-NoFace dataset while noting the in-house dataset's details.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
