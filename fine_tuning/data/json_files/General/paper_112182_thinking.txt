To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDQ: Stochastic Differentiable Quantization with Mixed Precision" by Xijie Huang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the **Experiments section (Section 4)** is where the authors describe the datasets used for their evaluations. I will focus on this section to find specific names and details of the datasets.

In **Section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, the authors mention two datasets used for their experiments:

1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: This dataset is referenced as a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

2. **ImageNet-1K Dataset**: This dataset is described as a large-scale dataset for image classification, containing over 1 million images across 1,000 categories.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for future researchers.

- For the **CIFAR-10 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For the **ImageNet-1K Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, Fei-Fei Li. *ImageNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Image Database*. In 2009 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 248â€“255, 2009.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, maintaining the integrity of the information for future use.
