To extract datasets from the research paper titled "New Evaluation, Library, and Analysis of Step-by-Step Reasoning with Large Language Models" by Shibo Hao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, and while it may not list datasets explicitly, it can hint at their presence.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in evaluating reasoning chains and may reference specific datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or references to prior work that might include datasets.

In the **experiments section**, I will pay close attention to any subsection that discusses datasets. The authors mention using several datasets for their evaluations, specifically in the context of reasoning tasks. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided about them.

The paper mentions the following datasets:

1. **GSM8k**: A dataset of math word problems that requires understanding relationships between numbers and performing multiple steps of calculations.
2. **AQuA**: A dataset that requires algebraic operations in addition to basic reasoning.
3. **Game of 24**: A task requiring the construction of an equation with four given numbers and basic arithmetic operations.
4. **StrategyQA**: A commonsense reasoning dataset that involves open-domain yes-no questions requiring multiple steps of inference.
5. **PrOntoQA**: A logical reasoning dataset that involves multi-step deductions based on logical principles.
6. **Blocksworld**: A benchmark for assessing embodied planning capabilities.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. This is crucial for ensuring that I provide complete and accurate references. 

The citations I will extract are:

- For **GSM8k**:
  > Karl Cobbe, Vineet Kosaraju, Mohammad Bavarian, Mark Chen, Heewoo Jun, Lukasz Kaiser, Matthias Plappert, Jerry Tworek, Jacob Hilton, Reiichiro Nakano, et al. *Training verifiers to solve math word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.14168, 2021.

- For **AQuA**:
  > Wang Ling, Dani Yogatama, Chris Dyer, and Phil Blunsom. *Program induction by rationale generation: Learning to solve and explain algebraic word problems*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1705.04146, 2017.

- For **Game of 24**:
  > This dataset is referenced in the context of the paper but does not have a specific citation provided in the text.

- For **StrategyQA**:
  > Mor Geva, Daniel Khashabi, Elad Segal, Tushar Khot, Dan Roth, and Jonathan Berant. *Did Aristotle use a laptop? A question answering benchmark with implicit reasoning strategies*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 9:346â€“361, 2021.

- For **PrOntoQA**:
  > Abulhair Saparov and He He. *Language models are greedy reasoners: A systematic formal analysis of chain-of-thought*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.01240, 2022.

- For **Blocksworld**:
  > Karthik Valmeekam, Sarath Sreedharan, Matthew Marquez, Alberto Olmo, and Subbarao Kambhampati. *On the planning abilities of large language models (a critical investigation with a proposed benchmark)*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.06706, 2023.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help me ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
