To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Contrastive Attention Mechanism for Abstractive Sentence Summarization" by Xiangyu Duan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that experiments were conducted on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are present. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context of abstractive sentence summarization and reference previous works that utilized various datasets. However, I need to find the specific datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly mention the datasets they evaluated their method on. In this section, they describe three datasets:

1. **Annotated Gigaword Corpus**: This dataset is mentioned as containing around 3.8 million training samples, 190,000 validation samples, and 1,951 test samples. The source-summary pairs are formed by pairing the first sentence of each article with its headline.

2. **DUC-2004**: This dataset is used for testing and contains 500 documents, each with four human-generated reference summaries. The length of the summaries is capped at 75 bytes.

3. **LCSTS (Large Scale Chinese Short Text Summarization)**: This dataset is collected from the Chinese microblogging website Sina Weibo, with 2.4 million source-summary pairs for training and 725 pairs for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **Annotated Gigaword Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Alexander M Rush, Sumit Chopra, and Jason Weston. *A neural attention model for abstractive sentence summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 379–389, 2015.

- For the **DUC-2004**, the citation is:
  > Chin-Yew Lin. *ROUGE: A package for automatic evaluation of summaries*. In Proc of the ACL-04 Workshop on Text Summarization Branches Out, 2004.

- For the **LCSTS**, the citation is:
  > Baotian Hu, Qingcai Chen, and Fangze Zhu. *LCSTS: A large scale Chinese short text summarization dataset*. In Proceedings of the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1967–1972, 2015.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
