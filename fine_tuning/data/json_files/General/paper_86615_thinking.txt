To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Closer Look At Feature Space Data Augmentation For Few-Shot Intent Classification" by Varun Kumar et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on two public conversational datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **SNIPS Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 13,084 training utterances, 700 development utterances, and 700 test utterances, collected from the Snips personal voice assistant.

2. **Facebook Dialog Corpus (FBDialog)**: This dataset includes 31,218 training utterances, 4,455 development utterances, and 9,019 test utterances, focusing on navigation and events.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **SNIPS Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Alice Coucke, Alaa Saade, Adrien Ball, Théodore Bluche, Alexandre Caulier, David Leroy, Clément Doumouro, Thibault Gisselbrecht, Francesco Caltagirone, Thibaut Lavril, et al. *Snips voice platform: an embedded spoken language understanding system for private-by-design voice interfaces*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.10190, 2018.

- For the **Facebook Dialog Corpus**, the citation is:
  > Rahul Gupta, Sonal Gupta, Rushin Shah, Mrinal Mohit, Anuj Kumar, and Mike Lewis. *Semantic parsing for task oriented dialog using hierarchical representations*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.07942, 2018.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
