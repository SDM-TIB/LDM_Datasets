To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantics-Guided Object Removal for Facial Images" by Jookyung Song et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the work, which may include references to datasets.

In the **experiments section**, the authors specifically mention the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they refer to the **Naturalistic Occlusion Generation (NatOcc)** dataset, which is used to create diverse occluded facial images. They also mention using images from the **HELEN** dataset and the **CelebA-HQ** dataset for training and evaluation purposes. 

Next, I will look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. The authors explain that the NatOcc dataset overlays human facial images from HELEN and CelebA-HQ with occluding objects, which is crucial for understanding how the datasets are utilized in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **Naturalistic Occlusion Generation (NatOcc)**:
   - Citation: 
     > Voo, K.T., Jiang, L., Loy, C.C. (2022). Delving into high-quality synthetic face occlusion segmentation datasets. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 4711–4720.

2. **HELEN Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Le, V., Brandt, J., Lin, Z., Bourdev, L., Huang, T.S. (2012). Interactive facial feature localization. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 679–692.

3. **CelebA-HQ Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Lee, C.H., Liu, Z., Wu, L., Luo, P. (2020). Maskgan: Towards diverse and interactive facial image manipulation. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 5549–5558.

With these citations in hand, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **Naturalistic Occlusion Generation (NatOcc)**: A dataset used to generate diverse occluded facial images by overlaying human facial images with occluding objects.
- **HELEN Dataset**: A dataset used for facial feature localization, providing images that serve as a base for creating occluded images.
- **CelebA-HQ Dataset**: A high-quality dataset of celebrity images used for training and evaluation in the context of facial image manipulation.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all relevant details are included for future reference or processing.
