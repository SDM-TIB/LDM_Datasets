To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EZCrop: Energy-Zoned Channels for Robust Output Pruning" by Rui Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and previous work, which might include dataset references.

Next, I will pay close attention to **section 5 (Experimental Results)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for experiments. Here, the authors mention that they conducted experiments on **CIFAR-10** and **ImageNet** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are relevant to the research.

I will then look for any additional details about these datasets in the text. For instance, CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset for image classification tasks, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset commonly used for various computer vision tasks. The paper does not provide extensive details about these datasets, but their names are sufficient for citation purposes.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A., Hinton, G., et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.-J., Li, K., and Fei-Fei, L. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pp. 248â€“255. IEEE, 2009.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is widely used for training machine learning models in image classification tasks.

2. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset containing over 14 million images categorized into thousands of classes. It is commonly used for training and benchmarking deep learning models in computer vision.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
