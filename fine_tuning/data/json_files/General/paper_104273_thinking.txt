To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Conditional Deep Gaussian Processes: Empirical Bayes Hyperdata Learning" by Chi-Ken Lu and Patrick Shafto, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments** within the paper. This section typically contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the research.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any **figures or tables** that may summarize the datasets or their results. These visual aids often provide concise information about the datasets and their applications in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **Mauna Loa CO2 dataset** for time-series analysis, I will look for the original source of this dataset in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Keeling, C.D. "The Concentration and Isotopic Abundance of Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere." *Tellus*, 1958.

Similarly, if the paper discusses the **Airline dataset**, I will find its citation, which could be:
> International Air Transport Association (IATA). "Airline Traffic Data." *IATA Statistics*, 2020.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset descriptions along with their full citations to ensure that they are accurately represented.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.
