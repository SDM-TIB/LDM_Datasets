To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Separation of Biocrude Produced from Hydrothermal Liquefaction of Faecal Sludge Without Any Solvent" by H M Fairooz Adnan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, and conclusions sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and findings, which may include mentions of data collection or analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors discuss any existing datasets or prior studies that utilized specific datasets relevant to their research. This section often provides context and background that may lead to identifying datasets.

In the **materials and methods section**, I will look for any specific datasets used in the experiments. This section typically details the experimental setup and may include information about the faecal sludge samples collected, including their source and any relevant characteristics. The authors mention collecting faecal sludge from the septic tank at Khulna University of Engineering & Technology, which is a key piece of information.

I will also examine the **results and discussion sections** for any analysis or findings based on the datasets. The authors may present data in tables or figures that summarize their results, which could indicate the datasets used for analysis.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** for full citations of any datasets or studies mentioned. This is crucial for providing proper attribution and context for the datasets used in the research.

In this paper, the primary dataset is the faecal sludge collected from the septic tank, which is described in detail. However, there are no additional datasets explicitly mentioned that require citations from other studies.

The full citation for the faecal sludge source is not typically provided in the references, as it is a primary data source collected by the authors. Therefore, I will note that the dataset is based on the authors' own collection and analysis.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset, its source, and any relevant details, ensuring that the citation is complete and accurate for any future reference.
