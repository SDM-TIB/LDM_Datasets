To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Leakage and the Reproducibility Crisis in ML-based Science" by Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses a survey of literature across various fields, which suggests that multiple datasets may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Evidence of a reproducibility crisis)** and **section 4 (A case study of civil war prediction)**, as these sections are likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the studies discussed. In section 2, the authors mention a survey of 20 papers across 17 fields, which indicates that there are datasets associated with these studies.

In **Table 1**, the authors summarize the findings from their survey, which includes references to specific datasets used in the papers they reviewed. I will extract the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided in the table.

In **section 4**, the authors conduct a reproducibility study in civil war prediction. They mention specific datasets used in the analysis, such as the dataset from Hegre & Sambanis (2006) and the imputed dataset from Muchlinski et al. (2016). I will note these datasets and any relevant details about their contents or characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be located by others.

For example, I will look for citations like:
- Hegre, H., & Sambanis, N. (2006). *Sensitivity Analysis of Empirical Results on Civil War Onset*. Journal of Conflict Resolution.
- Muchlinski, D., Siroky, D., He, J., & Kocher, M. (2016). *Comparing Random Forest with Logistic Regression for Predicting Class-Imbalanced Civil War Onset Data*. Political Analysis.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I capture all relevant datasets accurately and comprehensively.
