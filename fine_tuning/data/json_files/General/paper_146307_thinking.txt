To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis" by Tong Zhou and Shuqiang Wang, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors used a publicly accessible dataset for model training and validation, which suggests that a dataset is indeed present.

Next, I will focus on **section III (Experiment)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used. They state that they leveraged the **Localize-MI dataset**, which consists of high-density EEG data collected from seven drug-resistant epilepsy patients. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of sessions and the characteristics of the EEG data.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Localize-MI dataset. The authors reference the dataset as follows:

- **Localize-MI Dataset**: 
  > E. Mikulan, S. Russo, S. Parmigiani, S. Sarasso, F. M. Zauli, A. Rubino, P. Avanzini, A. Cattani, A. Sorrentino, S. Gibbs, et al. "Simultaneous human intracerebral stimulation and hd-eeg, ground-truth for source localization methods." *Scientific Data*, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 127, 2020.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Localize-MI Dataset**: This dataset contains high-density EEG data collected from seven drug-resistant epilepsy patients, comprising a total of 61 sessions. The dataset includes spatial locations of stimulus contacts in various coordinate spaces and the digital coordinates of 256 scalp EEG electrodes.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing.
