To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Student Network Learning via Evolutionary Knowledge Distillation" by Kangkai Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted, which suggests that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors describe their experiments on several benchmarks, which is a strong indicator that datasets are involved.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **CIFAR10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 32 × 32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

2. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10, this dataset contains 100 classes with 600 images each, totaling 60,000 images. It has 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset contains about 100,000 training images and 10,000 verification images, with 200 classes. The images are resized to 64 × 64 pixels.

4. **UMDFaces**: This dataset includes 367,888 face annotations for 8,277 subjects, collected from the Internet.

5. **UCCS**: This dataset consists of 16,149 images across 1,732 subjects, designed for low-resolution face recognition tasks.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR10** and **CIFAR100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Y. Le, X. Yang. *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. CS231N, 2015.

- For **UMDFaces**, the citation is:
  > A. Bansal, A. Nanduri, C. D. Castillo, R. Ranjan, R. Chellappa. *UMDFaces: An Annotated Face Dataset for Training Deep Networks*. In International Joint Conference on Biometrics, 2017, pp. 464–473.

- For **UCCS**, the citation is:
  > M. Günther, P. Hu, C. Herrmann, et al. *Unconstrained Face Detection and Open-Set Face Recognition Challenge*. In International Joint Conference on Biometrics, 2017.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
