To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Intelligent Multi-Modal Sensing-Communication Integration: Synesthesia of Machines" by Xiang Cheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for mixed multi-modal (MMM) datasets, which suggests that datasets are a key focus of the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology section**. The authors mention the **M3SC dataset**, which is described as a simulation dataset containing aligned multi-modal sensory data and wireless channel data. This dataset is crucial for their research on intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication integration.

In the **section discussing existing datasets**, the authors provide a classification of datasets relevant to their work. They mention several datasets, including:

1. **DeepMIMO**: A dataset aimed at promoting machine learning applications in mmWave/mMIMO research, constructed based on accurate ray-tracing data.

2. **5GMdata**: A dataset that combines a vehicle traffic simulator and a ray-tracing simulator to create scenarios with moving transceivers and objects.

3. **LiDARsim**: A dataset that produces realistic simulations of LiDAR point clouds using real-world data and deep neural networks.

4. **Vision-Wireless (ViWi)**: A dataset providing co-existing visual data and parameterized wireless channel data.
   - Citation: > Alrabeiah, M., Hredzak, A., & Alkhateeb, A. (2020). ViWi: A Deep Learning Dataset Framework for Vision-Aided Wireless Communications. In Proc. IEEE 91st Vehicular Technol. Conf. (VTC2020-Spring), Antwerp, Belgium.

5. **e-FLASH**: A large multi-modal dataset consisting of camera images, GPS, and LiDAR data supported with RF ground truth.
   - Citation: > Xu, R., et al. (2022). OPV2V: An Open Benchmark Dataset and Fusion Pipeline for Perception with Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication. In Proc. Int. Conf. Robot. Automat., Philadelphia, PA, USA.

6. **M3SC**: The dataset introduced by the authors, which contains aligned multi-modal sensory data and wireless channel data.
   - Citation: > Cheng, X., et al. (2023). M3SC: A Generic Dataset for Mixed Multi-Modal (MMM) Sensing and Communication Integration. China Commun., vol. 20, no. 11, pp. 13–29.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note their full citations as they are critical for proper referencing in any subsequent work or analysis.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy access and review.
