To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Neural Network for emotion recognition to assist psychiatrists and psychologists during the COVID-19 pandemic: experts’ opinion" by Hugo Mitre-Hernández et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but does not explicitly mention datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methods sections for more detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of facial emotion recognition (FER) and the need for emotional records in psychological treatments, but they do not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine the **methods section**, particularly **section 2.3 (Dataset, Preprocessing, and Training)**, where the authors describe the dataset used for training their model. Here, they mention the **Radboud Faces Database (RaFD)**, which is a high-quality dataset containing images of models displaying various emotional expressions.

The paper describes the RaFD dataset in detail:
- It includes pictures of 67 models (Caucasian males and females, children, and Moroccan Dutch males) displaying 8 emotional expressions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, contempt, and neutral.
- The dataset is used to train the ResmoNet model, focusing on images with front-facing views.

Now, I will look for the full citation of the **Radboud Faces Database (RaFD)** in the **References section**. The relevant citation is:
> Langner, Oliver, Ron Dotsch, Gijsbert Bijlstra, Daniel H. J. Wigboldus, Skyler T. Hawk, and Ad van Knippenberg. *Presentation and validation of the Radboud Faces Database*. Cognition and Emotion 24. Routledge: 1377–1388. https://doi.org/10.1080/02699930903485076.

Since the paper primarily focuses on this dataset for its experiments, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring to include the full citation for the dataset.

After gathering all necessary details, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Radboud Faces Database, ensuring that it is ready for any required output format or further processing.
