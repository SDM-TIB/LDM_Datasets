To extract datasets from the research paper titled "U-mesh: Human Correspondence Matching with Mesh Convolutional Networks" by Benjamin Groisser et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **FAUST correspondence challenge** and utilize the **DFAUST dataset**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will delve into **section 6 (Experiments)**, where the authors discuss their evaluation on the **FAUST correspondence challenge**. They mention that this dataset comprises 300 scans of 10 individual subjects, with 100 training samples and 200 test samples. This section confirms the use of the FAUST dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, in **section 5.2.1 (Real Data)**, the authors explicitly state that they use the **DFAUST dataset**, which is administered by the Max Planck Institute and consists of 40,000 scans. This dataset is essential for training their model.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **FAUST dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Bogo, J. Romero, M. Loper, and M. J. Black. *FAUST: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration*. Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3794–3801, 2014.

- For the **DFAUST dataset**, the citation is:
  > F. Bogo, J. Romero, G. Pons-Moll, and M. J. Black. *Dynamic FAUST: Registering Human Bodies in Motion*. Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 1–10, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **FAUST Dataset**: A benchmark dataset for 3D mesh registration, consisting of 300 scans of 10 subjects, with labeled training and test samples.
2. **DFAUST Dataset**: A large-scale dataset of 40,000 human surface scans used for training, focusing on dynamic registration of human bodies.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
