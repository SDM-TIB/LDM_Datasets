To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Aware Motion Simulation for T2*-Weighted Brain MRI" by Hannah Eichhorn et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of "real recorded subject motion" and "simulated data," which suggests that there are datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly **section 2.3 (Data)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **T2*-weighted datasets**: The authors state that they used 116 complex, coil-combined T2*-weighted datasets from 59 healthy volunteers. This dataset is crucial for their motion simulation and network training.

2. **Motion curves**: They also describe the extraction of 132 motion curves from 62 functional MRI (fMRI) time series, which are used for realistic motion simulation. This dataset is essential for generating augmented training samples.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations related to these datasets. However, since the T2*-weighted datasets are unpublished and derived from ongoing studies, they may not have a formal citation. The authors do mention that the data originates from studies approved by the local ethics committee, which is important for context but does not provide a formal citation.

For the motion curves, the authors reference their own work in the context of the motion simulation, but again, these are based on unpublished data. Therefore, I will note that while the datasets are described, they do not have formal citations as they are not publicly available.

Now, I will summarize the datasets identified:

1. **T2*-weighted datasets**: 116 complex, coil-combined datasets from 59 healthy volunteers, used for training and evaluation of the line classification network.
   - Citation: Unpublished data from ongoing studies (no formal citation available).

2. **Motion curves**: 132 motion curves extracted from 62 fMRI time series, used for generating augmented training samples.
   - Citation: Unpublished data from ongoing studies (no formal citation available).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have documented the datasets accurately, even if they lack formal citations.
