To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Semantic Equitable Clustering: A Simple, Fast and Effective Strategy for Vision Transformer" by Qihang Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed method, Semantic Equitable Clustering (SEC), is validated through comprehensive experiments in various vision tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names and any relevant details about their characteristics or usage.

Upon reviewing section 4, I find that the authors conducted experiments on three specific datasets:

1. **ImageNet-1k**: This dataset is widely known for image classification tasks and consists of 1,000 classes with a total of over 1.2 million images. It is a standard benchmark in the field of computer vision.

2. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is used for object detection, instance segmentation, and captioning tasks. It contains over 330,000 images, with more than 200,000 labeled images and 80 object categories.

3. **ADE20K**: This dataset is utilized for semantic segmentation tasks and includes over 20,000 images with pixel-level annotations across various scenes and objects.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **ImageNet-1k**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, et al. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, et al. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641, 2017.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:

1. **ImageNet-1k**
   - Citation: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, et al. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 248–255, 2009.

2. **COCO**
   - Citation: Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), pages 740–755, 2014.

3. **ADE20K**
   - Citation: Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, et al. *Scene parsing through ADE20K dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 633–641, 2017.

With this information, I am ready to proceed with any further processing or analysis as needed.
