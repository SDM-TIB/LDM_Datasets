To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unified Quality Assessment of In-the-Wild Videos with Mixed Datasets Training" by Dingquan Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention conducting experiments on **four publicly available datasets for VQA in the wild**. This indicates that there are specific datasets that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments, which are:

1. **LIVE-VQC**: This dataset is referenced in the context of video quality assessment and is mentioned as one of the datasets used in their experiments.
2. **LIVE-Qualcomm**: Another dataset used for evaluating video quality, also mentioned in the experiments.
3. **KoNViD-1k**: This dataset is included in the list of datasets used for the experiments.
4. **CVD2014**: The final dataset mentioned, which is also used in their evaluation.

I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **LIVE-VQC**, the citation is:
  > Sinno, Z., & Bovik, A. C. (2019). Large scale study of perceptual video quality. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 28(2), 612-627.

- For **LIVE-Qualcomm**, the citation is:
  > Ghadiyaram, D., & Bovik, A. C. (2018). Perceptual quality prediction on authentically distorted images using a bag of features approach. *IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology*, 28(9), 2061-2077.

- For **KoNViD-1k**, the citation is:
  > Hosu, V., Hahn, F., Jenadeleh, M., Lin, H., Men, H., Szirányi, T., & Li, S. (2017). The Konstanz natural video database (KoNViD-1k). In *International Conference on Quality of Multimedia Experience (QoMEX)*, pp. 1-6.

- For **CVD2014**, the citation is:
  > Nuutinen, M., Virtanen, T., Vaahteranoksa, M., Vuori, T., Oittinen, P., & Häkkinnen, J. (2016). CVD2014—a database for evaluating no-reference video quality assessment algorithms. *IEEE Transactions on Image Processing*, 25(7), 3073-3086.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This structured approach will help in extracting the necessary datasets effectively and accurately.
