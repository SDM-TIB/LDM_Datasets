To extract datasets from the research paper titled "An updated State-of-the-Art Overview of transcriptomic Deconvolution Methods" by Bastien Chassagnol et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses computational deconvolution techniques but does not specify any datasets. I will need to look deeper into the body of the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses various computational methodologies and their applications but does not provide specific dataset names.

I will then focus on the **sections that describe the methodologies** and **experiments**. These sections often contain references to datasets used for validation or testing of the methods. I will look for any mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics.

As I read through the paper, I will pay special attention to any **figures, tables, or references** that might indicate the datasets used. If the authors refer to specific datasets or studies, I will note those down.

After identifying potential datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets.

For example, if I find that the authors used the **CIBERSORT** algorithm, I will look for the original paper that introduced this algorithm to cite it correctly. The citation might look something like this:
> Newman, A. M., Liu, C. L., Green, M. R., Gentles, A. J., Feng, W., Xu, Y., ... & Alizadeh, A. A. (2015). *Robust enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles*. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112(19), 5789-5794.

If I find multiple datasets, I will ensure to document each one with its respective citation, including any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data (e.g., RNA-Seq, microarray), and the specific applications or analyses they were used for.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference and further analysis.
