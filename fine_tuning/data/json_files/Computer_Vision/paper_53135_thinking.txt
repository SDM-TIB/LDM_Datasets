To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Devil is in the Frequency: Geminated Gestalt Autoencoder for Self-Supervised Visual Pre-Training" by Hao Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the self-supervised Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and mentions the use of quantitative and qualitative experiments, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** (Section 4) to find detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. This section typically contains the most relevant information regarding datasets, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that may be important for understanding their use in the research.

In the experiments section, I will look for any references to datasets such as ImageNet, COCO, or ADE20K, as these are commonly used in visual recognition tasks. If the authors mention any specific datasets, I will take note of their names and any relevant details provided.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation allows others to locate the datasets easily. I will ensure to extract the complete citation format, including authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for its citation, which typically includes:
- Authors: Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei.
- Title: "ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database."
- Venue: In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition.
- Pages: 248â€“255.
- Year: 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names and full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

Finally, I will ensure that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets mentioned in the paper, along with their citations, to provide a comprehensive overview of the data used in the research.
