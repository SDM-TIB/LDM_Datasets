To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Sparse Wavelet Representations" by Daniel Recoskie and Richard Mann, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, evaluation, and conclusion sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, but it may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction might mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison, so I will pay close attention to any references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **evaluation section** where the authors describe their experiments. Here, they mention using segments from the **MIDI aligned piano dataset (MAPS)** for real data and synthetic data generated from simple periodic waves. This indicates that the MAPS dataset is a key dataset used in their experiments.

I will then look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the MAPS dataset. The citation for the MAPS dataset is:
> Valentin Emiya, Roland Badeau, and Bertrand David. *Multipitch estimation of piano sounds using a new probabilistic spectral smoothness principle*. IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, 18(6):1643â€“1654, 2010.

Additionally, I will note that the authors also mention synthetic data generated from periodic waves, but they do not provide a specific dataset name or citation for this synthetic data, as it is generated based on their own methodology.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the MAPS dataset. 

In summary, the key dataset extracted from the paper is the **MIDI aligned piano dataset (MAPS)**, and I have its full citation ready for inclusion in the final output.
