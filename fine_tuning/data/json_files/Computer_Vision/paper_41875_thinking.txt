To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lower Dimensional Kernels for Video Discriminators" by Emmanuel Kahembwe et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed methods demonstrate good performance on complex and diverse datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly mention the **UCF-101 dataset** for quantitative experiments and the **MUG Facial Expression Database (MUG-FED)** for qualitative experiments. I will take note of the details provided for each dataset.

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: This dataset consists of 13,320 video clips divided across 101 different action categories, with a spatial resolution of 320 by 240 pixels. The authors mention that it was initially introduced for action recognition but is widely used in the GAN research field for benchmarking.

2. **MUG-FED**: This dataset comprises 1,462 video sequences of 86 individuals demonstrating seven categories of facial expressions. The videos are recorded at a resolution of 896x896 pixels and vary in length from 40 to 180 frames.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **UCF-101 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Soomro, K., Zamir, A.R., Shah, M. (2012). *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. CoRR abs/1212.0402. URL: http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0402.

- For the **MUG Facial Expression Database**, the citation is:
  > Aifanti, N., Papachristou, C., Delopoulos, A. (2010). *The MUG facial expression database*. In: 11th International Workshop on Image Analysis for Multimedia Interactive Services, WIAMIS 2010, Desenzano del Garda, Italy, April 12-14, 2010, pp. 1â€“4. URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5617662/.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
