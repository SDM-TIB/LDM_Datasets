To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invisible-to-Visible: Privacy-Aware Human Instance Segmentation using Airborne Ultrasound via Collaborative Learning Variational Autoencoder" by Risako Tanigawa et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors created a dataset for evaluating their proposed method, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe their experimental setup. They mention that they created a dataset specifically for their experiments because no existing datasets use airborne ultrasound for human body detection. This is a crucial point, as it indicates the dataset is original and specific to their research.

In this section, the authors provide details about the dataset creation process, including the number of images (19,982), the types of actions performed (standing, sitting, walking, running), and the conditions under which the data was collected (participants located 1 to 3 meters away from the sensing devices). They also mention that the dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is original and created by the authors, it may not have an external citation. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper itself.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: Custom Dataset for Human Instance Segmentation
- **Description**: A dataset created for evaluating the proposed method, containing 19,982 images of human actions (standing, sitting, walking, running) captured using airborne ultrasound and RGB cameras.
- **Data Collection Method**: Participants performed actions at distances of 1 to 3 meters from the sensing devices, with videos recorded at 30 frames per second.
- **Train/Test Split**: 80% for training and 20% for testing.

Since this dataset is original and specific to the authors' work, I will include the citation for the paper itself as the authoritative source for the dataset:

Citation:
> Risako Tanigawa, Yasunori Ishii, Kazuki Kozuka, and Takayoshi Yamashita. *Invisible-to-Visible: Privacy-Aware Human Instance Segmentation using Airborne Ultrasound via Collaborative Learning Variational Autoencoder*. 

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing or review.
