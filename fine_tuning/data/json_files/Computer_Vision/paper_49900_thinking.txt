To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MURAL: Multimodal, Multitask Retrieval Across Languages" by Aashi Jain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of "billions of translation pairs" and "image-caption pairs," indicating that multiple datasets are involved. This prompts me to look for specific dataset names and details.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Data)**, which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, I will find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Conceptual 12M (CC12M)**: This dataset is described as containing 12 million image-caption pairs obtained from web images and their corresponding alt-text descriptions. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Changpinyo, S., Sharma, P., Ding, N., & Soricut, R. (2021). *Conceptual 12M: Pushing web-scale image-text pre-training to recognize long-tail visual concepts*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.08981.

2. **Alt-Text**: This dataset consists of 1.8 billion images and their alt-text descriptions, covering 110 languages. The citation is:
   > Jia, C., Yang, Y., Xia, Y., Chen, Y.-T., Parekh, Z., Pham, H., ... & Duerig, T. (2021). *Scaling up visual and vision-language representation learning with noisy text supervision*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.05918.

3. **Ensemble of Open Bilingual Translation (EOBT) Pairs**: This dataset is created by combining several publicly available datasets, including Europarl, Paracrawl, and JW300, totaling approximately 500 million pairs. The citation for Europarl is:
   > Koehn, P. (2005). *Europarl: A parallel corpus for statistical machine translation*. In Proceedings of Machine Translation Summit X: Papers, pages 79–86.

4. **Mined Bilingual Translation (MBT) Pairs**: This dataset contains 6 billion translation pairs mined from the web. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Feng, F., Yang, Y., Cer, D., Arivazhagan, N., & Wang, W. (2020). *Language-agnostic BERT sentence embedding*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.01852.

5. **Flickr30K**: This dataset has 31,000 images, each with five English captions. The citation is:
   > Young, P., Lai, A., Hodosh, M., & Hockenmaier, J. (2014). *From image descriptions to visual denotations: New similarity metrics for semantic inference over event descriptions*. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2, 67–78.

6. **Multi30K**: This dataset extends Flickr30K with German, French, and Czech captions. The citation is:
   > Elliott, D., Frank, D., Barrault, L., Bougares, F., & Specia, L. (2016). *Multi30K: Multilingual English-German image descriptions*. In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, pages 70–74.

7. **MS-COCO**: This dataset includes five human-generated English captions per image. The citation is:
   > Lin, T.-Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., ... & Zitnick, C. L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common objects in context*. In European conference on computer vision, pages 740–755.

8. **STAIR**: This dataset adds human-crowdsourced Japanese captions for MS-COCO images. The citation is:
   > Yoshikawa, Y., Shigeto, Y., & Takeuchi, A. (2017). *STAIR captions: Constructing a large-scale Japanese image caption dataset*. In Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), pages 417–421.

9. **Wikipedia Image-Text (WIT)**: This dataset is mined from Wikipedia and covers 108 languages. The citation is:
   > Srinivasan, K., Raman, K., Chen, J., Bendersky, M., & Najork, M. (2021). *WIT: Wikipedia-based image text dataset for multimodal multilingual machine learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2103.01913.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the relevant datasets and their sources as required.
