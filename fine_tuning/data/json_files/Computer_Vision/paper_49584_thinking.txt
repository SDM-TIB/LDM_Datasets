To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inverse design optimization framework via a two-step deep learning approach: application to a wind turbine airfoil" by Sunwoong Yang, Sanga Lee, and Kwanjung Yee, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention datasets used for validation or testing. 

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where the authors describe the validation of their framework. In this section, they mention using the **Xfoil** numerical solver for aerodynamic analysis, which indicates that the data generated from this solver is crucial for their experiments.

I will also look for any specific datasets mentioned in the **results section**. The authors discuss the optimization problems and the performance of their framework, which may include references to datasets used for training the models or for validation purposes.

In the **appendix and references sections**, I will check for any additional datasets or sources that may have been cited. The references may include datasets that were used in previous studies or foundational datasets that inform the current research.

After identifying the datasets, I will ensure to extract the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. For example, if the authors refer to datasets from previous works, I will note the complete citation details as they appear in the references section.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited according to the standards of academic writing.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract the relevant datasets from the paper effectively and ensure that all necessary citation details are included.
