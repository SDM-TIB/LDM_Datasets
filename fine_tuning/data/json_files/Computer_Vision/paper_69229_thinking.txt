To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PFDM: Parser-Free Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Model" by Yunfang Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction typically outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of virtual try-on methods and mention the need for datasets that can help improve garment fitting in images. However, they do not explicitly name any datasets here.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their experimental setup. In **section 4.1 (Experimental Setup)**, they mention evaluating their model on the **VITON-HD dataset**. This dataset is described as containing 13,679 high-resolution image pairs of women and upper body clothing, which is crucial for their experiments.

I will also note that they mention generating pseudo-inputs using three well-performed models to augment their training data, but they do not specify additional datasets beyond VITON-HD.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VITON-HD dataset. The citation is as follows:
- **VITON-HD Dataset**: 
  > Seunghwan Choi, Sunghyun Park, Minsoo Lee, and Jaegul Choo. *Viton-hd: High-resolution virtual try-on via misalignment-aware normalization*. In IEEE Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recog. (CVPR), pages 14131â€“14140, 2021.

With this information, I have identified the relevant dataset used in the paper and its citation. I will compile this into a structured format for clarity and future reference.

In summary, the key steps I took were:
1. Read through the abstract and introduction for context.
2. Focus on the experiments section to identify the specific dataset used.
3. Retrieve the full citation from the references section.

Now, I will prepare the dataset entry based on the information gathered.
