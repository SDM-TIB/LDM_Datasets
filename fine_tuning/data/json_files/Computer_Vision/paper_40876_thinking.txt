To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning 3D-aware Egocentric Spatial-Temporal Interaction via Graph Convolutional Networks" by Chengxi Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention validating their framework on the **Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD)**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the introduction, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding human interactions in driving scenarios, which suggests that they will provide details about the datasets used for this purpose.

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors validate their framework specifically on the **Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD)**. They describe it as the largest dataset with diverse tactical driver behavior annotations, consisting of 104 hours of egocentric videos with frame-level annotations. This confirms that HDD is the primary dataset used in their research.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD)**. The citation is as follows:
> V. Ramanishka, Y.-T. Chen, T. Misu, and K. Saenko. *Toward Driving Scene Understanding: A Dataset for Learning Driver Behavior and Causal Reasoning*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the HDD dataset, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dataset utilized in the research.
