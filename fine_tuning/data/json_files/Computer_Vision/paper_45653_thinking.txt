To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distance-Based Anomaly Detection for Industrial Surfaces Using Triplet Networks" by Tareq Tayeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the paper focuses on surface anomaly detection using a specific dataset, which suggests that there is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will examine **section III (Background)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used in their research. They refer to the **MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset (MVTec AD)**, describing it as a comprehensive dataset with over 5000 images across 15 different industrial object and texture categories. This section provides essential details about the dataset, including its structure and the types of defects it includes.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset consists of both non-defective and defective samples, which is crucial for understanding how the dataset is utilized in their experiments. They specify that 11 classes are used for training and testing, while 4 classes are reserved solely for testing.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the MVTec AD dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

- For **MVTec Anomaly Detection Dataset (MVTec AD)**, the citation is:
  > P. Bergmann, M. Fauser, D. Sattlegger, and C. Steger. *MVTec AD — A Comprehensive Real-World Dataset for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection*. In Proceedings of the 2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Long Beach, CA, USA, pages 9584–9592, 2019.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the specified format, ready for further processing or review.
