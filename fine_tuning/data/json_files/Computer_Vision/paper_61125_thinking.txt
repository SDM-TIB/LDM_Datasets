To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Few-Shot Learning with Visual Distribution Calibration and Cross-Modal Distribution Alignment" by Runqi Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on **11 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved. This is a good starting point for identifying the datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors describe their methodology and results. In **section 4.1 (Implementation Details)**, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. The paper states that the datasets cover a diverse set of benchmarks, including:

1. **CIFAR10**: A well-known dataset for image classification containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
2. **ImageNet-1k**: A large-scale dataset with over 1 million images across 1,000 categories, widely used for image classification tasks.
3. **Caltech-101**: A dataset consisting of images from 101 object categories, commonly used for object recognition tasks.
4. **Oxford-IIIT Pets**: A dataset containing images of 37 breeds of cats and dogs, with annotations for segmentation and classification.
5. **Food-101**: A dataset with 101 food categories, containing 101,000 images for food classification tasks.
6. **STL-10**: A dataset for unsupervised feature learning, consisting of 10 classes with 13,000 labeled images.
7. **UCF-101**: A dataset for action recognition in videos, containing 13,320 videos across 101 action categories.
8. **DTD (Describable Textures Dataset)**: A dataset for texture recognition, containing images of various textures.
9. **Stanford Cars**: A dataset with images of 196 classes of cars, used for fine-grained classification.
10. **CIFAR100**: Similar to CIFAR10 but with 100 classes, containing 60,000 images.
11. **FGVC Aircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained visual classification of aircraft, containing images of 100 different aircraft models.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets are as follows:
