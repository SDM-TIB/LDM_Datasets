To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Least Squares Support Vector Regression for Anisotropic Diffusion Filtering" by Arsham Gholamzadeh Khoee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study but may not contain specific dataset information. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and methodology sections for detailed descriptions.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of signal smoothing and the techniques used, but they do not mention specific datasets. I will then move to the **methodology section**, where they describe the data generation process for their numerical experiments. Here, they mention simulating noisy signals by adding white noise to Gaussian and Lorentzian peaks, which indicates that they generated their own datasets rather than using pre-existing ones.

Next, I will look for any specific references to datasets in the **results section**. The authors provide numerical results and comparisons with the Savitzky-Golay method, but they do not cite any external datasets. Instead, they describe the parameters used for generating their synthetic datasets, such as the height, position, and width of the peaks.

Since the paper does not reference any publicly available datasets, I will summarize the generated datasets based on the parameters provided in the methodology. The authors describe the generation of noisy signals using the Pearson VII function, which is a parameterization of the Student-t distribution.

Now, I will compile the information regarding the generated datasets, including the parameters used for their creation. However, since there are no formal citations for these datasets, I will note that they are synthetic datasets created by the authors for the purpose of their experiments.

Finally, I will ensure to document the details of the generated datasets clearly, even though they lack formal citations, as they are essential for understanding the context of the experiments conducted in the paper.
