To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning Implicit Priors for Motion Optimization" by Julen Urain et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a high-level overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets or data sources that the authors utilized for their experiments. If the authors mention datasets, I will note their names and any relevant details provided.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental sections**. In this paper, the authors describe three experiments: 
1. Simulated Planar Navigation
2. Simulated Planar Manipulator
3. Robot Pouring amid Obstacles

For each experiment, I will look for specific mentions of datasets. For example, in the first experiment, the authors mention generating datasets through random uniform sampling and stochastic trajectory generation. I will note the details of these datasets, including the number of samples and the context in which they were generated.

In the second experiment, the authors describe generating grasp points and insert trajectories, specifying the number of samples for each. I will extract this information and ensure I capture the context of how these datasets were created.

In the third experiment, the authors mention recording trajectory demonstrations for the pouring task. I will note the number of demonstrations and the context in which they were collected.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. If the datasets are original to the authors' work, I will note that as well.

For example, if the authors refer to datasets from previous works, I will ensure to include those citations. If they created their own datasets, I will provide a description of the dataset along with a note indicating that it is original to this research.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format for clarity and ease of use.

By following this methodical approach, I will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
