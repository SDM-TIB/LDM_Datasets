To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Rich Human Feedback for Text-to-Image Generation" by Youwei Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the collection of "rich human feedback on 18K generated images," which indicates that a dataset is involved. The introduction further elaborates on this, specifically naming the dataset **RichHF-18K** and describing its contents.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any relevant subsections that provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the research. In this paper, the dataset **RichHF-18K** is described in detail, including its components: point annotations for implausibility/artifacts, text-image misalignment, labeled keywords, and fine-grained scores.

I will also check the **experiments** section to confirm that the dataset is utilized in the experiments and to gather any additional context about its application. The authors mention using **RichHF-18K** for training their multimodal transformer model, which reinforces its significance in the study.

After identifying the dataset, I will refer to the **References** section to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper mentions that the **RichHF-18K** dataset will be released soon, but it does not provide a formal citation for it. However, I will note that it is based on the **Pick-a-Pic dataset**, which is referenced in the paper.

The citation for the **Pick-a-Pic dataset** is:
> Yuval Kirstain, Adam Polyak, Uriel Singer, Shahbuland Matiana, Joe Penna, and Omer Levy. *Pick-a-Pic: An Open Dataset of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.01569, 2023.

Now, I will summarize the findings regarding the datasets:

1. **RichHF-18K**: A dataset of rich human feedback on 18K generated images, containing annotations for implausibility/artifacts, text-image misalignment, labeled keywords, and fine-grained scores.
   - Citation: Not formally cited yet, but based on the **Pick-a-Pic dataset**.

2. **Pick-a-Pic Dataset**: A dataset used for collecting human preferences for text-to-image generation.
   - Citation: Yuval Kirstain, Adam Polyak, Uriel Singer, Shahbuland Matiana, Joe Penna, and Omer Levy. *Pick-a-Pic: An Open Dataset of User Preferences for Text-to-Image Generation*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.01569, 2023.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review, ensuring that I have accurately captured the datasets and their citations.
