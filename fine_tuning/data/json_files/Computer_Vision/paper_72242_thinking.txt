To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction" by Yi Rong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on **two real-world traffic datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly mention the datasets used. In the paper, they refer to two datasets: **METR-LA** and **Ningxia-YC**. I will look for detailed descriptions of these datasets, including their characteristics, such as the number of nodes, edges, and the time period covered.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide the following details:

1. **METR-LA Dataset**: This dataset consists of 207 sensors collecting traffic speed data along highways in Los Angeles County from March 1, 2012, to June 30, 2012. The data collection frequency is every 5 minutes.

2. **Ningxia-YC Dataset**: This dataset includes 108 sensors monitoring traffic speed within Yinchuan City, China, covering the period from June 1, 2021, to August 31, 2021. The data collection frequency for this dataset is every 15 minutes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **METR-LA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Li, Y., Yu, R., Shahabi, C., & Liu, Y. (2017). Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network: Data-driven traffic forecasting. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.01926*.

- For the **Ningxia-YC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zou, G., Lai, Z., Ma, C., Tu, M., Fan, J., & Li, Y. (2023). A novel spatio-temporal generative inference network for predicting the long-term highway traffic speed. *Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies*, 154, 104263.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented.
