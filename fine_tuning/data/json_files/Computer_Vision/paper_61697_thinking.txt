To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring the Versatility of Zero-Shot CLIP for Interstitial Lung Disease Classification" by Cara Van Uden et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a dataset of CT studies, which indicates that there is a dataset relevant to the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Methods)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the dataset. They describe a dataset consisting of **2303 CT studies from 1321 patients**, which is crucial for understanding the scope of their research. This section also mentions that the dataset was retrieved from the hospital's picture archiving and communication system (PACS) and that the cases were selected based on specific criteria related to interstitial lung disease (ILD).

In **Table 1**, the authors provide statistics about the dataset, including the number of patients, CT scans, age, gender distribution, and the percentage of ILD cases. This table is essential for understanding the dataset's composition and characteristics.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, the dataset itself does not have a specific citation like publicly available datasets. Instead, it is derived from clinical data collected at a hospital, which may not be formally published as a standalone dataset.

Since the dataset is not publicly available and does not have a formal citation, I will note that the dataset is based on internal hospital data and provide a description of its characteristics instead.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Internal CT Studies Dataset
   - **Description**: A dataset consisting of 2303 CT studies from 1321 patients, selected based on high-resolution CT scan protocols for evaluating ILD. The dataset includes manually reviewed radiology reports to assess findings indicative of ILD.
   - **Characteristics**: 
     - Patients: 1321
     - CT Scans: 2303
     - Age: Average 63.8 years
     - Female Percentage: 57.5%
     - ILD in CT Percentage: 86.4%
     - Diagnoses include Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), and others.

After gathering this information, I will compile it into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
