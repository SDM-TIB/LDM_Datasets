To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration of Various Deep Learning Models for Increased Accuracy in Automatic Polyp Detection" by Ariel E. Isidro et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of deep learning models for detecting polyps, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for any specific dataset names or references in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section 3) where the authors describe their approach to training models. Here, they mention using the **CVC-ClinicDB**, a database that contains images for training their models. This is a crucial dataset, and I will need to gather more details about it.

In section 3, the authors state that the dataset consists of **968 different images** divided into two classes: polyp and normal. They also describe how the dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. This information is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and usage.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the **CVC-ClinicDB** dataset. The authors reference it as a source for their experiments, so I need to ensure I have the correct citation format.

After gathering all necessary details, I will compile the information into a structured format. The key dataset I identified is:

1. **CVC-ClinicDB**: A dataset used for polyp detection in colonoscopy images, consisting of 968 images categorized into polyp and normal classes.

Now, I will look for the full citation for the **CVC-ClinicDB** dataset in the references. The citation is likely to be found in the context of other studies that have utilized this dataset.

Once I have the citation, I will ensure that I have all the required details to create a complete entry for the dataset, including its name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings and prepare the dataset entry for further processing or review.
