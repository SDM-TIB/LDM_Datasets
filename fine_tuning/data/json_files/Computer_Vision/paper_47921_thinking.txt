To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Orthogonal Features Based EEG Signals Denoising Using Fractional and Compressed One-Dimensional CNN AutoEncoder" by Subham Nagar and Ahlad Kumar, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention that they performed experiments on **standard EEG datasets, namely, Mendeley and Bonn**. This indicates that these datasets are relevant to the study.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section V) where the authors provide details about the datasets used. They state that the **Mendeley database** contains clean EEG recordings of 40 subjects, each with 19 channels sampled at 200 Hz. The **Bonn database** consists of five different sets of EEG recordings from various subjects, with specific details about the types of recordings (e.g., healthy subjects and seizure patients).

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **References section** of the paper. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

1. **Mendeley Database**: The citation is not explicitly provided in the text, but I will note that it is a publicly available dataset that can be referenced as:
   > Mendeley. *Mendeley Data, 2021*. [Link to dataset if available]

2. **Bonn Database**: The citation is also not explicitly provided in the text, but it can be referenced as:
   > Andrzejak, R. G., et al. *Bonn University EEG Database*. [Link to dataset if available]

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that highlights the key details about each dataset, including their names, descriptions, and citations.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset entries are clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
