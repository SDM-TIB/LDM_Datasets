To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "BSGAN: A Novel Oversampling Technique for Imbalanced Pattern Recognitions" by Md Manjurul Ahsan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their proposed method on four highly imbalanced datasets, which suggests that these datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Performance Evaluation)**, where the authors provide a summary of the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention four datasets:

1. **Ecoli**: This dataset consists of 335 samples, with 20 minority samples and 315 majority samples. The minority class represents 5.97% of the total samples. It is used for protein localization prediction.

2. **Yeast**: This dataset contains 513 samples, with 51 minority samples and 462 majority samples, resulting in a minority class percentage of 9.94%. It is used for predicting protein localization.

3. **Wine Quality**: This dataset has 1,599 samples, with 20 minority samples and 1,579 majority samples, leading to a minority class percentage of 2.74%. It is used for classifying wine quality.

4. **Abalone**: This dataset includes 4,177 samples, with 840 minority samples and 3,337 majority samples, resulting in a minority class percentage of 20.1%. It is used for predicting the age of abalones.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The datasets are primarily sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a common source for benchmark datasets in machine learning research. However, the paper does not provide specific citations for each dataset, so I will note that they are from the UCI repository.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the names, descriptions, and any relevant details about the datasets, along with the acknowledgment that they are sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and attributed correctly.
