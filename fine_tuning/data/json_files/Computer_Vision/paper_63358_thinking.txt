To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Implicit Graph Neural Diffusion Networks: Convergence, Generalization, and Over-Smoothing" by Guoji Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and often mentions the datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their model's performance on benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets in detail. In this paper, the authors mention conducting experiments on several datasets for node and graph classification tasks. Specifically, they refer to:

1. **Chameleon**: A dataset used for node classification, which is a well-known benchmark in the field.
2. **Squirrel**: Another dataset for node classification, also commonly used in GNN research.
3. **Penn94**: A dataset used for semi-supervised learning tasks.
4. **Cornell5**: A dataset used for semi-supervised learning tasks.
5. **Amherst41**: Another dataset for semi-supervised learning tasks.
6. **Cora**: A citation network dataset widely used for node classification.
7. **CiteSeer**: Another citation network dataset used for similar tasks.
8. **PubMed**: A dataset from the biomedical domain used for node classification.
9. **MUTAG**: A dataset for graph classification in the bioinformatics domain.
10. **PTC**: Another bioinformatics dataset used for graph classification.
11. **PROTEINS**: A dataset consisting of graphs representing proteins.
12. **NCI1**: A dataset of chemical compounds for graph classification.
13. **IMDB-B**: A social network dataset for graph classification.
14. **IMDB-M**: Another social network dataset for graph classification.
15. **PPI**: A dataset for multi-label multi-graph inductive learning.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For example, the citations for some of the datasets might look like this:

- **Chameleon**: 
  > K. Pei, Y. Liu, and L. Wang. *Geom-GCN: Geometric Graph Convolutional Networks*. In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2020.

- **Cora**: 
  > M. Sen, A. Namata, G. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Gallagher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective Classification in Network Data*. AI Magazine, 29(3):93–106, 2008.

- **PPI**: 
  > M. Zitnik and J. Leskovec. *Predicting Multicellular Function through Multi-layer Tissue Networks*. Bioinformatics, 33(14):i190–i198, 2017.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that all relevant datasets are accurately documented and attributed in the final output.
