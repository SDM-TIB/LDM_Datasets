To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Edge-aware Feature Aggregation Network for Polyp Segmentation" by Tao Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the authors conducted experiments on "five widely adopted colonoscopy datasets," which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors provide details about the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they list the following datasets:

1. **Kvasir**: This dataset consists of 1,000 colonoscopy images collected from inside the gastrointestinal tract by Vestre Viken Health Trust in Norway.

2. **CVC-ClinicDB**: This dataset contains 612 images collected from 29 colonoscopy video sequences, with a resolution of 288×384.

3. **CVC-ColonDB**: This dataset consists of 380 images with a resolution of 500 × 570.

4. **ETIS**: This dataset includes 196 colonoscopy images with a size of 966 × 1225.

5. **CVC-300**: This dataset contains 60 colonoscopy images with a resolution of 500×574.

The authors also mention that they randomly selected 1,450 images to construct the training set, which includes images from Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB, while the remaining images were used for testing.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **Kvasir**, the citation is:

- For **CVC-ClinicDB**, the citation is:

- For **CVC-300**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
