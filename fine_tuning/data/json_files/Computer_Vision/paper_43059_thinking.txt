To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Test-time adaptable neural networks for robust medical image segmentation" by Neerav Karani et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors validate their method on multi-center Magnetic Resonance imaging datasets for three anatomies: brain, heart, and prostate. This suggests that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide specific details about the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **Brain MRI Datasets**:
   - **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**: This dataset includes T1w and T2w images for each subject.
   - **Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE)**: This dataset consists of T1w images from several imaging sites.

2. **Prostate MRI Datasets**:
   - **National Cancer Institute (NCI)**: This dataset serves as the source domain (SD).
   - **PROMISE12**: This dataset is used as a target domain (TD).
   - **University Hospital of Zurich (USZ)**: Another target domain dataset with expert annotations.

3. **Cardiac MRI Datasets**:
   - **Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)**: This dataset is used as the source domain.
   - **Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge (RVSC)**: This dataset is used as a target domain.

In addition to identifying the datasets, I will also look for the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. 

The citations I will extract are as follows:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This structured approach will help in creating a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
