To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AutoGAN: Robust Classifier Against Adversarial Attacks" by Blerta Lindqvist et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors tested their method using the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit classification.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for any additional context or details about the datasets used. The introduction reiterates the use of the **MNIST dataset** for binary classification of digits three and seven, confirming its significance in the experiments.

I will then look into the **experiments and results** section, specifically **section 4**, where the authors describe their methodology and the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention using the **MNIST dataset** for their experiments, which solidifies its role in the study.

To ensure I have the correct citation for the dataset, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citation for the **MNIST dataset** is as follows:
- Yann LeCun. *The MNIST database of handwritten digits*. http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, 1998.

Since the paper primarily focuses on the MNIST dataset, I will compile this information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will summarize the dataset entry, ensuring that it is clear and concise, ready for any further processing or review.
