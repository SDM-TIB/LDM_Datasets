To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Effectiveness of Vision Language Models for Open-world Single Image Test Time Adaptation" by Manogna Sreenivas and Soma Biswas, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions "extensive experimentation on diverse domain adaptation benchmarks," which suggests that datasets are involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention using a diverse set of datasets for weak and strong out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Specifically, they list:

1. **CIFAR-10C**: A corruption dataset consisting of 10 classes with 15 common corruption types, totaling 10,000 images for each corruption.
2. **CIFAR-100C**: Similar to CIFAR-10C but with 100 classes, also totaling 10,000 images for each corruption.
3. **ImageNet-C**: A large-scale corruption dataset with 1,000 categories and 50,000 images, synthesized from various corruption types.
4. **ImageNet-R**: A style transfer dataset with 200 classes and 30,000 images.
5. **VisDA**: A synthetic-to-real dataset with 152,397 synthetic training images and 55,388 real testing images across 12 categories.
6. **MNIST**: A dataset of handwritten digits with 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images.
7. **SVHN**: A dataset of house numbers from real street images, consisting of 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
8. **Tiny ImageNet**: A smaller version of ImageNet with 200 classes and 100,000 images.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
