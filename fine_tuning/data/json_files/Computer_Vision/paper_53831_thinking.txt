To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mitigating Out-of-Distribution Data Density Overestimation in Energy-Based Models" by Beomsu Kim and Jong Chul Ye, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the authors demonstrate improved out-of-distribution (OOD) data detection performance on the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors detail their methodology and results, specifically mentioning the **Fashion-MNIST dataset** and comparing the performance of their proposed method against other datasets, including **MNIST**, **KMNIST**, and **NotMNIST**. This suggests that these datasets are also utilized in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. **Fashion-MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

2. **MNIST**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. *Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition*. Proc. of the IEEE, 86(11):2278–2324, 1998.

3. **KMNIST**: The citation is:
   > Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Asanobu Kitamoto, Alex Lamb, Kazuaki Yamamoto, and David Ha. *Deep Learning for Traditional Japanese Literature*. arXiv:1812.01718, 2018.

4. **NotMNIST**: The citation is:
   > Yaroslav Bulatov. *Machine Learning, etc: NotMNIST Dataset*. 2011.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations for future use or analysis.
