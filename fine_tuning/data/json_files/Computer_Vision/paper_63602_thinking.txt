To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SurgicalSAM: Efficient Class Promptable Surgical Instrument Segmentation" by Wenxi Yue et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors refer to experiments conducted on the **EndoVis2018** and **EndoVis2017** datasets, indicating that these are the primary datasets used in their research.

Next, I will delve into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets. In section 4.1, they explicitly mention the two datasets:

1. **EndoVis2018**: This dataset consists of 11 training videos and four validation videos, each containing 149 frames. It is used for evaluating surgical instrument segmentation.

2. **EndoVis2017**: This dataset includes eight videos, each with 255 frames, and is also utilized for surgical instrument segmentation tasks.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **EndoVis2018**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Kondo, S., Bodenstedt, S., et al. (2020). *2018 Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge*. arXiv:2001.11190.

- For **EndoVis2017**, the citation is:
  > Allan, M., Shvets, A., Kurmann, T., et al. (2019). *2017 Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge*. arXiv:1902.06426.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **EndoVis2018**: A dataset consisting of 11 training videos and four validation videos, each with 149 frames.
   - Citation: Allan, M., Kondo, S., Bodenstedt, S., et al. (2020). *2018 Robotic Scene Segmentation Challenge*. arXiv:2001.11190.

2. **EndoVis2017**: A dataset comprising eight videos, each with 255 frames.
   - Citation: Allan, M., Shvets, A., Kurmann, T., et al. (2019). *2017 Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge*. arXiv:1902.06426.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
