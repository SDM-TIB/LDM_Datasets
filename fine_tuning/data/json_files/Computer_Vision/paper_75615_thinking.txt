To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Gaussian Splatting" by Liuyue Xie et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 5), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. Here, they mention four datasets: 

1. **Dynamic Scenes dataset**: This dataset is referenced as being captured with a stationary multi-view camera rig and is used to evaluate the method's performance on dynamic scenes.

2. **Planoptic Video dataset**: This dataset is noted for being captured using a static rig with multiple GoPro cameras, providing a different perspective on dynamic scene reconstruction.

3. **HyperNeRF dataset**: The authors mention this dataset as suitable for capturing objects with moving topologies, which is relevant for their method's evaluation.

4. **DAVIS dataset**: This dataset contains near-static monocular videos and is used to assess the method's performance under different conditions.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for each of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I find are:

- **Dynamic Scenes dataset**:

- **HyperNeRF dataset**:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
