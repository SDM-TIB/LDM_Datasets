To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fidelitous Augmentation of Human Accelerometric Data for Deep Learning" by T. K. M. Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the use of accelerometric data in a clinical setting, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section III (Data Collection and Setup)**, where the authors describe their dataset in detail. Here, they mention that the dataset comprises data from a triaxial accelerometer embedded in a 10 cm cube, moved by subjects during a rehabilitative test. They specify that data were recorded from **34 patients** who had a history of stroke, and they provide details about the scoring system used to evaluate the movements.

In this section, I will note the key characteristics of the dataset:
- **Number of patients**: 34
- **Number of recorded data sets**: 78
- **Scoring system**: Scores range from 0 to 3 based on the completion of the task.

The authors also mention that the data cannot be shared publicly due to the sensitive nature of the research, which is important to note.

Next, I will look for any references to other datasets or related works in the **background work** and **theory and approach** sections. However, it appears that the focus is primarily on the methodology and the specific dataset they collected.

Finally, I will check the **References section** to find any citations related to the dataset or methodologies used. The paper does not provide a specific dataset citation since the data is not publicly available, but it does reference several works that may be relevant to the methods employed.

The key dataset extracted from the paper is:
1. **Rehabilitative Accelerometric Dataset**: This dataset consists of accelerometric data collected from 34 patients during a rehabilitative test, with a total of 78 recorded data sets. The dataset is not publicly available due to privacy concerns.

Since there are no formal citations for the dataset itself, I will note that the authors have cited their previous works and methodologies that relate to the data collection and augmentation processes.

Now, I will summarize the findings and prepare to present the dataset information clearly, ensuring that I highlight the lack of public availability and the context of the dataset within the research.
