To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Preventing Manifold Intrusion with Locality: Local Mixup" by RaphaÃ«l Baena, Lucas Drumetz, and Vincent Gripon, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the introduction of Local Mixup and its evaluation on standardized computer vision benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors refer to using **CIFAR-10**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **SVHN** datasets for their experiments. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

In the **experiments subsection 5.2.2**, the authors provide specific details about each dataset:
1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of small images of size 32x32 pixels across 10 classes, with 50,000 images in the training set.
2. **Fashion-MNIST**: Composed of clothing images of size 28x28 pixels (grayscale), containing 60,000 images in the training set across 10 classes.
3. **SVHN**: A real-world image dataset made of small cropped digits of size 32x32 pixels, containing 73,257 digits in the training set across 10 classes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2012.

- For **Fashion-MNIST**, the citation is:
  > Han Xiao, Kashif Rasul, and Roland Vollgraf. *Fashion-MNIST: a novel image dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.07747, 2017.

- For **SVHN**, the citation is:
  > Yuval Netzer, Tao Wang, Adam Coates, Alessandro Bissacco, Bo Wu, and Andrew Y Ng. *Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning*. 2011.

With this information gathered, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
