To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transforming Radiance Field with Lipschitz Network for Photorealistic 3D Scene Stylization" by Zicheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors discuss their method's performance on various datasets, which is a good starting point.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors often outline the context of their work and may reference datasets that are foundational to their research. Here, they mention using datasets like the **NeRF-synthetic dataset**, **LLFF dataset**, **Tanks and Temples dataset**, and **multi-view stereo DTU dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are critical for their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of how each dataset was used. The authors mention conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the aforementioned datasets, which confirms their relevance. They also specify that the style images are derived from the **PST dataset**. 

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

1. **NeRF-synthetic dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2020.

2. **LLFF dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Rodrigo Ortiz-Cayon, Nima Khademi Kalantari, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Ren Ng, and Abhishek Kar. *Local Light Field Fusion: Practical View Synthesis with Prescriptive Sampling Guidelines*. In ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2019.

3. **Tanks and Temples dataset**: The citation is:
   > A. Knapitsch, Jaesik Park, Qian-Yi Zhou, and Vladlen Koltun. *Tanks and Temples: Benchmarking Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction*. In ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 2017.

4. **Multi-view stereo DTU dataset**: The citation is:
   > Rasmus Ramsbøl Jensen, A. Dahl, George Vogiatzis, Engil Tola, and Henrik Aanæs. *Large Scale Multi-View Stereopsis Evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014.

5. **PST dataset**: The citation is:
   > Fujun Luan, Sylvain Paris, Eli Shechtman, and Kavita Bala. *Deep Photo Style Transfer*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, facilitating further exploration and validation of the findings presented in the paper.
