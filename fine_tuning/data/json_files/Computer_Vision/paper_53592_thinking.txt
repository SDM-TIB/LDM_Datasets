To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depression Diagnosis and Forecast based on Mobile Phone Sensor Data" by Xiangheng He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study utilizes mobile phone sensor data for depression diagnosis and forecasting, which suggests that there may be a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will look closely at **Section II (Dataset and Feature Extraction)**, where the authors introduce the **MAIKI dataset**. This section provides detailed information about the dataset, including its purpose, the number of participants, and the types of data collected. The MAIKI dataset is described as being collected from 48 participants over 8 weeks, focusing on both active and passive data related to depression.

In this section, the authors also mention that the dataset includes various types of passive data, such as phone call, phone usage, user activity, and GPS data. This is crucial information as it outlines the specific features extracted from the dataset.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citation for the MAIKI dataset. The paper states that the dataset was collected as part of the "Mobile daily living therapy assistant with interaction-focused artificial intelligence for depression" project, which is essential for proper citation.

Since the MAIKI dataset is the primary dataset discussed in the paper, I will compile the following information for it:

1. **Dataset Name**: MAIKI dataset
2. **Description**: A dataset collected from 48 participants using a mobile phone sensor data acquisition app over 8 weeks, including both active and passive data related to depression.
3. **Full Citation**: The citation for the MAIKI project is not explicitly provided in the references, but I will note that it is associated with the ethics committee approval from the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the dataset's details and citation. Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry in the required format for further processing or review.
