To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mirror-NeRF: Learning Neural Radiance Fields for Mirrors with Whitted-Style Ray Tracing" by Junyi Zeng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not specify datasets. The introduction often discusses the context and may reference datasets used in prior work or the current study.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, the authors mention that they created **5 synthetic datasets** and captured **4 real datasets**. They specify that the synthetic datasets are indoor rooms downloaded from BlendSwap, including living room, meeting room, washroom, bedroom, and office. The real datasets were captured in various indoor scenes using an iPad Pro, including a clothing store, lounge, market, and discussion room.

Now, I will compile the details of these datasets:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: 
   - **Living Room**: A synthetic dataset representing a typical living room environment.
   - **Meeting Room**: A synthetic dataset representing a meeting room environment.
   - **Washroom**: A synthetic dataset representing a washroom environment.
   - **Bedroom**: A synthetic dataset representing a bedroom environment.
   - **Office**: A synthetic dataset representing an office environment.

2. **Real Datasets**:
   - **Clothing Store**: A real dataset captured in a clothing store environment.
   - **Lounge**: A real dataset captured in a lounge environment.
   - **Market**: A real dataset captured in a market environment.
   - **Discussion Room**: A real dataset captured in a discussion room environment.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since the synthetic datasets are created by the authors and the real datasets are captured by them, they may not have formal citations. Instead, I will note the source of the synthetic datasets (BlendSwap) and the method of capturing the real datasets (using an iPad Pro).

Finally, I will summarize the datasets with their descriptions and any relevant citations or sources. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or documentation.
