To extract datasets from the research paper titled "LG-GAN: Label Guided Adversarial Network for Flexible Targeted Attack of Point Cloud-based Deep Networks" by Hang Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the limitations of existing methods and introduce their novel approach. However, I need to look for specific datasets that are utilized in their experiments.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset is described as a comprehensive collection of 3D CAD models for objects, containing 12,311 objects from 40 categories, with 9,843 used for training and 2,468 for testing.

2. **ShapeNet**: This dataset is a subset of the full ShapeNet dataset, which includes single clean 3D models with manually verified category and alignment annotations. It covers 55 common object categories with 52,472 unique 3D models, where 41,986 are used for training and 10,486 for testing.

To ensure accuracy, I will also check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and further exploration of the datasets.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Zhirong Wu, Shuran Song, Aditya Khosla, Fisher Yu, Linguang Zhang, Xiaoou Tang, and Jianxiong Xiao. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1912â€“1920, 2015.

- For **ShapeNet**, the citation is:
  > Angel X. Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation for proper referencing.
