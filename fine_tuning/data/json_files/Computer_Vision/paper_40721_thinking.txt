To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AFP-Net: Realtime Anchor-Free Polyp Detection in Colonoscopy" by Dechun Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and while it may not explicitly mention datasets, it sets the context for the research. The introduction often discusses the background and may reference datasets used in prior work, which could lead me to the datasets relevant to this study.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly the part where the authors describe their data preparation and augmentation process. Here, they mention the datasets used for training and testing their model. Specifically, I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names, descriptions, and the number of samples or images included in each dataset.

In the paper, the authors mention three datasets:

1. **GIANA**: This dataset is used for both polyp detection and segmentation tasks. It contains 18 short videos for training and 20 for testing, along with 300 images for training and 612 for testing in the segmentation task. The authors note that they extracted image frames from the videos and converted segmentation annotations to bounding boxes.

2. **CVC-CLINIC**: This dataset consists of 612 still frames from 29 endoscopic videos, with pixel-level ground truth annotations provided by the Computer Vision Center in Barcelona. All 612 images are used as the testing set for their experiments.

3. **ETIS-LARIB**: This dataset contains 192 high-resolution images with pixel-level annotations converted to bounding boxes for the detection task. The authors evaluate their model on this dataset as well.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are as follows:

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their descriptions and citations, into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
