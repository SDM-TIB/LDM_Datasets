To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point-DAE: Denoising Autoencoders for Self-supervised Point Cloud Learning" by Yabin Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a masked autoencoder for self-supervised point cloud learning, which suggests that datasets are likely involved in the experiments. I will look for any specific dataset names mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant details about how they were used in the experiments.

In the paper, the authors mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for self-supervised pre-training, which contains about 51K samples shared by 55 categories. They also mention the **ScanNetv2 dataset**, which includes 1,201 scenes for training, validation, and testing in the context of 3D object detection. These are key datasets that I need to document.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

1. **ShapeNet dataset**:
   > A. X. Chang, T. Funkhouser, L. Guibas, P. Hanrahan, Q. Huang, Z. Li, S. Savarese, M. Savva, S. Song, H. Su, J. Xiao, L. Yi, and F. Yu. *ShapeNet: An Information-Rich 3D Model Repository*. Stanford University — Princeton University — Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, Tech. Rep. arXiv:1512.03012 [cs.GR], 2015.

2. **ScanNetv2 dataset**:
   > A. Dai, A. X. Chang, M. Savva, M. Halber, T. Funkhouser, and M. Nießner. *Scannet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017, pp. 5828–5839.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that the extraction is complete and ready for further processing or review.
