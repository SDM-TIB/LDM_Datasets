To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SAFE OFFLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH FEASIBILITY-GUIDED DIFFUSION MODEL" by Yinan Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on the **DSRL benchmark for safe offline RL**, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the challenges of safe offline reinforcement learning and reference the **DSRL benchmark** as a standard for evaluation. This suggests that the DSRL benchmark is a key dataset used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, I will look for detailed descriptions of the datasets used. The authors mention conducting evaluations on **Safety-Gymnasium**, **Bullet-Safety-Gym**, and **MetaDrive** tasks, which are all part of the DSRL benchmark. I will note these as datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. **DSRL Benchmark**: The citation for the DSRL benchmark is:
   > Zuxin Liu, Zijian Guo, Haohong Lin, Yihang Yao, Jiacheng Zhu, Zhepeng Cen, Hanjiang Hu, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, et al. *Datasets and benchmarks for offline safe reinforcement learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.09303, 2023.

2. **Safety-Gymnasium**: The citation for Safety-Gymnasium is:
   > Aaron D. Ames, Samuel Coogan, Magnus Egerstedt, Gennaro Notomista, Koushil Sreenath, and Paulo Tabuada. *Control barrier functions: Theory and applications*. In 2019 18th European Control Conference (ECC), pp. 3420–3431. IEEE, 2019.

3. **Bullet-Safety-Gym**: The citation for Bullet-Safety-Gym is:
   > Sven Gronauer. *Bullet-safety-gym: A framework for constrained reinforcement learning*. 2022.

4. **MetaDrive**: The citation for MetaDrive is:
   > Quanyi Li, Zhenghao Peng, Lan Feng, Qihang Zhang, Zhenghai Xue, and Bolei Zhou. *Metadrive: Composing diverse driving scenarios for generalizable reinforcement learning*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 45(3):3461–3475, 2022.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
