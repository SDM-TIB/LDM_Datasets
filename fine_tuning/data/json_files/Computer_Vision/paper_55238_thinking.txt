To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Doc-GCN: Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks for Document Layout Analysis" by Siwen Luo et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on three widely used Document Layout Analysis (DLA) datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (specifically section 4) where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In section 4.1, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **PubLayNet**: This dataset contains 358,353 PDF document images annotated with five different categories of layout components: Text, Title, List, Table, and Figure.

2. **FUNSD**: A smaller dataset extracted from the RVL-CDIP dataset, containing 199 scanned PDF pages of survey forms with four different types of layout components: Header, Question, Answer, and Other.

3. **DocBank**: This dataset contains 500K PDF document pages with more sophisticated annotations for layout components, including 13 different categories such as Abstract, Author, Caption, Date, Equation, Figure, Footer, List, Paragraph, Reference, Section, Table, and Title.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **PubLayNet**, the citation is:
  > Zhong, Y., Tang, J., & Jimeno Yepes, A. (2019). *PubLayNet: Largest dataset ever for document layout analysis*. In 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), pages 1015–1022. IEEE.

- For **FUNSD**, the citation is:
  > Jaume, G., Ekenel, H. K., & Thiran, J.-P. (2019). *FUNSD: A dataset for form understanding in noisy scanned documents*. In 2019 International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition Workshops (ICDARW), volume 2, pages 1–6. IEEE.

- For **DocBank**, the citation is:
  > Li, M., Xu, Y., Cui, L., Huang, S., Wei, F., & Zhou, M. (2020). *DocBank: A benchmark dataset for document layout analysis*. In Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 949–960.

With these citations in hand, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations from the paper.
