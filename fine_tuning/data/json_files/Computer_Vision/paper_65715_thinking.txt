To extract datasets from the research paper titled "EmoCLIP: A Vision-Language Method for Zero-Shot Video Facial Expression Recognition" by Niki Maria Foteinopoulou and Ioannis Patras, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method using four popular dynamic FER datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experimental results** sections. In the introduction, the authors mention using the MAFW dataset for training and evaluating their method on three additional datasets: AFEW, DFEW, and FERV39K. This gives me a preliminary list of datasets to look for.

In the **experimental setup** section, the authors explicitly state that they train on the **MAFW** dataset and evaluate on **AFEW**, **DFEW**, and **FERV39K**. They provide details about the MAFW dataset, including its size and the nature of its annotations, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's context.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

1. **MAFW Dataset**:

3. **DFEW Dataset**:

4. **FERV39K Dataset**:

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, which is essential for reproducibility and further research in the field.
