To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Physics-Informed Probabilistic Learning of Linear Embeddings of Non-linear Dynamics With Guaranteed Stability" by Shaowu Pan and Karthik Duraisamy, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work, and it may mention specific datasets used for evaluation or experimentation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. This section often contains detailed information about the datasets, including their names, sizes, and any relevant characteristics.

In this paper, the authors mention evaluating their framework on several systems, including:
1. **Dynamical systems**: They refer to a simple polynomial system and a Duffing oscillator, but they do not specify datasets in the traditional sense. Instead, they generate data through simulations.
2. **Flow wake behind a cylinder**: The authors mention that data is generated by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using OpenFOAM, which indicates that the dataset is derived from computational fluid dynamics simulations.

I will also check the **references section** to see if any datasets are cited or if there are any foundational papers that describe the datasets used in their experiments. However, since the datasets are generated from simulations rather than sourced from existing datasets, I will note that the authors do not provide traditional dataset citations.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dynamical Systems Data**: Data generated from a simple polynomial system and the Duffing oscillator, with specific parameters mentioned in the paper.
2. **Flow Wake Data**: Data generated from the Navier-Stokes equations using OpenFOAM, with details about the simulation setup provided in the methodology.

Since the paper does not provide formal citations for these datasets, I will note that the datasets are derived from the authors' simulations and methodologies rather than from publicly available datasets.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that captures the essence of the datasets used in the research, ensuring clarity and completeness in the descriptions.
