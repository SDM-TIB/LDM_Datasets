To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Multiscale Autoencoder with Structural-Functional Attention Network for Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction" by Yongcheng Zong et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a model for Alzheimer’s disease prediction using T1-weighted Imaging (T1WI) and functional MRI (fMRI), which suggests that these imaging modalities are part of the datasets used.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** to find specific details about the datasets. In section 3.1, the authors explicitly mention using the **Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)** dataset. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of imaging pairs and the types of samples included (AD, EMCI, LMCI, and NC).

The paper states that they used **206 pairs of T1WI and fMRI imaging datasets** from the ADNI3 dataset, which is crucial information for dataset extraction.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the ADNI dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **ADNI dataset**, the citation is:
  > Jack Jr, C. R., Bernstein, M. A., Fox, N. C., et al. *The Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI): MRI methods*. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Official Journal of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 27(4), pp. 685–691, 2008.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry for the ADNI dataset, ensuring to include the full citation as required.

In summary, I will extract the following dataset information:
1. **Dataset Name**: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
2. **Description**: The dataset includes 206 pairs of T1WI and fMRI imaging datasets, with samples categorized as AD, EMCI, LMCI, and NC.
3. **Full Citation**: Jack Jr, C. R., Bernstein, M. A., Fox, N. C., et al. *The Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI): MRI methods*. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Official Journal of the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 27(4), pp. 685–691, 2008.

Finally, I will prepare this information for structured output as needed.
