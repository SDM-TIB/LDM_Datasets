To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Perception of prosodic variation for speech synthesis using an unsupervised discrete representation of F0" by Zack Hodari, Catherine Lai, and Simon King, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and data sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research but may not explicitly mention datasets. The introduction may give context about the data used, but the **data section** is likely where the datasets will be detailed.

In **section 4 (Data)**, the authors mention using the **Blizzard Challenge 2018 dataset**. This dataset is described as consisting of stories read in an expressive style for a 4â€“6 year old audience, totaling 6.5 hours of professionally recorded speech from a female speaker of standard southern British English. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their experiments.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Blizzard Challenge 2018 dataset. The citation provided in the references is:
> S. King, J. Crumlish, A. Martin, and L. Wihlborg. *The Blizzard challenge 2018*. In Proceedings of the Blizzard Challenge Workshop, Hyderabad, India, 2017.

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it.

Now, I will summarize the findings:
1. **Blizzard Challenge 2018 dataset**: Contains 6.5 hours of expressive speech data, specifically designed for TTS applications.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry with the full citation for the Blizzard Challenge 2018 dataset, ensuring that all relevant details are included for clarity and completeness.
