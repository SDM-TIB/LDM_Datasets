To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dual-Cross Central Difference Network for Face Anti-Spoofing" by Zitong Yu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that comprehensive experiments were performed on **four benchmark datasets**, which indicates that datasets are indeed involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In **Section 4.1 (Datasets and Metrics)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets:

1. **OULU-NPU**: This dataset is described as a high-resolution database containing four protocols to evaluate generalization under various conditions. It is used for intra testing.

2. **CASIA-MFSD**: This is a small-scale database with low-resolution videos, used for cross testing.

3. **Replay-Attack**: Another small-scale database, also with low-resolution videos, used for cross testing.

4. **SiW-M**: This dataset is designed for cross-type testing and contains a rich variety of attack types.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OULU-NPU**, the citation is:
  > Zinelabidine Boulkenafet, Jukka Komulainen, Lei Li, Xiaoyi Feng, and Abdenour Hadid. *Oulu-npu: A mobile face presentation attack database with real-world variations*. In FGR, 2017.

- For **CASIA-MFSD**, the citation is:
  > Zhiwei Zhang, Junjie Yan, Sifei Liu, Zhen Lei, Dong Yi, and Stan Z Li. *A face antispooﬁng database with diverse attacks*. In ICB, 2012.

- For **Replay-Attack**, the citation is:
  > Ivana Chingovska, André Anjos, and Sébastien Marcel. *On the effectiveness of local binary patterns in face anti-spooﬁng*. In Biometrics Special Interest Group, 2012.

- For **SiW-M**, the citation is:
  > Yaojie Liu, Amin Jourabloo, and Xiaoming Liu. *Learning deep models for face anti-spooﬁng: Binary or auxiliary supervision*. In CVPR, 2018.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
