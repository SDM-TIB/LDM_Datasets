To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Label-free Scene Understanding by Vision Foundation Models" by Runnan Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments conducted on "diverse indoor and outdoor datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. The introduction further emphasizes the importance of scene understanding and hints at the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the datasets in the **experiments section**. They refer to three datasets:

1. **ScanNet**: The paper states that ScanNet consists of 1,603 indoor scans collected by RGB-D cameras, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This dataset is crucial for their experiments on 3D scene understanding.

2. **nuScenes**: This dataset is described as comprising 700 scenes for training, 150 for validation, and 150 for testing, focusing on LiDAR semantic segmentation. The authors mention that it includes a total of 24,109 sweeps of LiDAR scans.

3. **nuImages**: The authors note that nuImages provides 93,000 2D annotated images, with specific splits for training, validation, and testing. This dataset is used for 2D semantic segmentation tasks.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **ScanNet**, the citation is:
  > Angela Dai, Angel Chang, Manolis Savva, Maciej Halber, Thomas Funkhouser, and Matthias Nießner. *ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D reconstructions of indoor scenes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 5828–5839, 2017.

- For **nuScenes**, the citation is:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

- For **nuImages**, the citation is the same as nuScenes since it is part of the same dataset publication:
  > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 11621–11631, 2020.

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing.
