To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Neurodevelopmental Age Estimation of Infants Using a 3D-Convolutional Neural Network Model based on Fusion MRI Sequences" by Mahdieh Shabanian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that MRI datasets from normal newborns were obtained from the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive, which suggests that there is a specific dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods section**, particularly the subsection titled **Dataset**. Here, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their study. They mention that they obtained **570 normal MRI scans** (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and PD-weighted sequences) of **112 infants** from the NIMH Data Archive. This section also specifies the age range of the infants (from 8 days to 3 years) and the screening criteria for the subjects, which adds context to the dataset.

In addition, I will look for any references to the dataset in the **Results section** to confirm its use in the experiments. The authors discuss the performance of their model using this dataset, which reinforces its significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. Since the dataset is sourced from the NIMH Data Archive, I will note that the citation for the dataset itself may not be explicitly provided in the references. However, I can mention the source as follows:

- **NIMH Data Archive**: The dataset of MRI scans is sourced from the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive, which is a recognized repository for neuroimaging data.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation as required. The dataset entry will highlight the number of scans, the types of MRI sequences, and the age range of the subjects.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
