To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Arboretum: A Large Multimodal Dataset Enabling AI for Biodiversity" by Chih-Hsuan Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and the sections specifically dedicated to the dataset**. The abstract provides a high-level overview and mentions the ARBORETUM dataset, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for large, diverse datasets for biodiversity applications and introduce ARBORETUM as a solution. They mention that it includes 134.6 million images across various taxonomic classes, which indicates that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (The Arboretum Dataset)**, where the authors provide detailed characteristics of the dataset. They specify that ARBORETUM comprises over 134.6 million images across seven taxonomic classes: Aves, Arachnida, Insecta, Plantae, Fungi, Mollusca, and Reptilia. This section also highlights the dataset's scale and the diversity of species it covers, which is crucial for understanding its significance.

The authors also mention that the dataset is sourced from the **iNaturalist Open Dataset**, which is important for citation purposes. They describe the curation process and the metadata associated with the images, including common names, scientific names, and taxonomic hierarchies.

In **section 4 (Models and Benchmarks)**, the authors introduce a subset of the ARBORETUM dataset called **ARBORETUM-40M**, which consists of approximately 40 million samples and 33,000 species. This subset is used to train their new vision-language foundation models, ARBORCLIP. This indicates that ARBORETUM is not only a standalone dataset but also serves as a foundation for further research and model development.

Additionally, the authors create new benchmark datasets from ARBORETUM, including **Arboretum-Balanced**, **Arboretum-Unseen**, and **Arboretum-LifeStages**. Each of these benchmarks is designed for specific evaluation tasks, further emphasizing the dataset's versatility.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The key dataset is ARBORETUM, which is the primary focus of the paper. The citation for the iNaturalist Open Dataset is also relevant since it is the source of the images used in ARBORETUM.

The full citation for the ARBORETUM dataset is:
> Yang, C.-H., Feuer, B., Jubery, Z., Deng, Z. K., Nakkab, A., Hasan, M. Z., Chiranjeevi, S., Marshall, K., Baishnab, N., Singh, A. K., Singh, A., Sarkar, S., Merchant, N., Hegde, C., & Ganapathysubramanian, B. (2024). *Arboretum: A Large Multimodal Dataset Enabling AI for Biodiversity*. Preprint. Under review.

The citation for the iNaturalist Open Dataset is:
> Van Horn, G., Mac Aodha, O., Song, Y., Cui, Y., Sun, C., Shepard, A., Adam, H., Perona, P., & Belongie, S. (2018). *The iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 8769â€“8778.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will help ensure that I accurately capture the datasets and their significance as presented in the paper.
