To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Density Estimation and Incremental Learning of Latent Vector for Generative Autoencoders" by Jaeyoung Yoo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments using various high-dimensional image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiments)**, as this section typically contains detailed information about the datasets used for the experiments. In **subsection 4.3 (Image Generation)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets they utilized:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is used for image generation tasks, specifically for face attributes. The authors mention using the aligned version of CelebA, which contains a large number of celebrity images with annotated attributes.

2. **Shoes Dataset**: This dataset is used for generating images of shoes. The authors indicate that they randomly divided the dataset into training and test sets.

3. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for benchmarking image generation and classification tasks.

4. **Toronto Face Dataset (TFD)**: This dataset contains images of faces and is used for evaluating the generative model's performance.

5. **BSDS300 Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating image segmentation algorithms and is also mentioned in the context of the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For **CelebA Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Z. Liu, P. Luo, X. Wang, and X. Tang. *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015.

- For **Shoes Dataset**, the citation is:

- For **Toronto Face Dataset (TFD)**, the citation is:
  > J. M. Susskind, A. K. Anderson, and G. E. Hinton. *The Toronto Face Database*. Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, Tech. Rep, 3, 2010.

- For **BSDS300 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > D. Martin, C. Fowlkes, D. Tal, and J. Malik. *A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics*. In Proc. 8th Int’l Conf. Computer Vision, volume 2, pages 416–423, July 2001.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
