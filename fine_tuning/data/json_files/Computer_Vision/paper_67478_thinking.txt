To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PCRDiffusion: Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Point Cloud Registration" by Yue Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of point cloud registration and mention that they will evaluate their method on specific datasets. This indicates that datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two datasets:

1. **ModelNet40**: This dataset contains 12,308 CAD models of 40 different object categories, with each point cloud consisting of 2,048 points sampled from the mesh faces.

2. **3DMatch**: This dataset includes 62 indoor subscenes, which represent various scenarios with different overlap rates.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For **ModelNet40**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Z., Song, S., Khosla, A., Yu, F., Zhang, L., Tang, X., & Xiao, J. (2015). *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1912–1920.

- For **3DMatch**, the citation is:
  > Zeng, A., Song, S., Nießner, M., Fisher, M., Xiao, J., & Funkhouser, T. (2017). *3DMatch: Learning Local Geometric Descriptors from RGB-D Reconstructions*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 1802–1811.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details and that the citations are accurate and complete.
