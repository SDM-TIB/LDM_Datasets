To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Measuring the Credibility of Student Attendance Data in Higher Education for Data Mining" by Mohammed Alsuwaiket, Christian Dawson, and Firat Batmaz, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the importance of student attendance data and its credibility, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors mention specific datasets or sources of data. They discuss the significance of student attendance data in higher education and the need for credible measures, but I need to look for explicit mentions of datasets.

In the **methodology section**, the authors describe their approach to measuring Student Attendance's Credibility (SAC) and mention that they used data from the Computer Science Department at Loughborough University during the academic year 2014-2015. This indicates that they have a specific dataset related to student attendance.

I will then look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets used. For instance, they provide a table (Table I) showing the SAC for 10 random modules over 5 years, which indicates that they have collected data over multiple semesters.

Next, I will check the **results and discussion sections** to see if they provide more details about the datasets, such as the number of students, modules, or specific attributes of the data collected.

Finally, I will consult the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets mentioned. However, since the paper primarily discusses the authors' own dataset from Loughborough University, I will focus on that.

The key dataset I will extract is:

1. **Student Attendance Data from Loughborough University**: This dataset includes attendance records for various modules taken by students during the academic year 2014-2015. The authors mention that the data was noisy and required cleaning before analysis.

Now, I will compile the full citation for the dataset:

- For the **Student Attendance Data**, the citation is:
  > Mohammed Alsuwaiket, Christian Dawson, and Firat Batmaz. *Measuring the Credibility of Student Attendance Data in Higher Education for Data Mining*. International Journal of Information and Education Technology, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 121-127, February 2018.

After gathering this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for review or further processing.
