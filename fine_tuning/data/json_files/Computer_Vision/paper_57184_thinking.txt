To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InDiReCT: Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning for Images" by Konstantin Kobs, Michael Steininger, and Andreas Hotho, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on **five datasets** with various similarity notions, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Experiments section** (section 4), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention the following datasets along with their respective similarity notions:

1. **Synthetic Cars**: This dataset contains 3D-rendered car images with various properties. The authors define three similarity notions:
   - Car Model
   - Car Color
   - Background Color

2. **Cars196**: A well-known dataset featuring real-world car images. The similarity notions defined are:
   - Car Model
   - Manufacturer
   - Car Type

3. **CUB200**: A dataset consisting of bird images grouped by species. The similarity notion is:
   - Bird Species

4. **DeepFashion**: This dataset includes images of clothing. The similarity notions are:
   - Clothing Category
   - Texture
   - Fabric
   - Fit

5. **Movie Posters**: A dataset of movie posters with the following similarity notions:
   - Genre
   - Production Country

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

- For **Synthetic Cars**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan Krause, Michael Stark, Jia Deng, and Li Fei-Fei. *3D Object Representations for Fine-Grained Categorization*. In 4th International IEEE Workshop on 3D Representation and Recognition (3dRR-13), Sydney, Australia, 2013.

- For **Cars196**, the citation is:

- For **CUB200**, the citation is:

- For **DeepFashion**, the citation is:
  > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Shi Qiu, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *DeepFashion: Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations*. In Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), June 2016.

- For **Movie Posters**, the citation is:
  > Wei-Ta Chu and Hung-Jui Guo. *Movie Genre Classification Based on Poster Images with Deep Neural Networks*. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Multimodal Understanding of Social, Affective and Subjective Attributes, pages 39â€“45, 2017.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach will ensure that I accurately capture all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
