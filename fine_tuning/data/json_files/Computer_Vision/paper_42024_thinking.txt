To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Hybrid Multiple Attention Network for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Images" by Ruigang Niu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ISPRS Vaihingen** and **Potsdam** benchmarks, which suggests that these datasets are crucial for the study.

Next, I will look specifically in **section IV (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they provide detailed descriptions of both datasets:

1. **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**: This dataset consists of 33 orthorectified image tiles with three spectral bands and a normalized digital surface model. It has a ground sampling distance of 9 cm and includes five foreground object classes and one background class. The authors mention using 16 images for training and 17 for testing.

2. **Potsdam Dataset**: This dataset contains 38 high-resolution images, each measuring 6000 Ã— 6000 pixels, with a ground sampling distance of 5 cm. It includes NIR-R-G-B channels along with DSM and normalized DSM. The training set consists of 24 images, while the test set has 16 images, with six foreground classes.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For the **ISPRS Vaihingen Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS. 2D Semantic Labeling Contest - Vaihingen. [Online]. Available: http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/2d-sem-label-vaihingen.html

- For the **Potsdam Dataset**, the citation is:
  > ISPRS. 2D Semantic Labeling Contest - Potsdam. [Online]. Available: http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/2d-sem-label-potsdam.html

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will summarize the findings and prepare to format them according to the required structure for further processing or review.
