To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Immersive Neural Graphics Primitives" by Ke Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the evaluation of a NeRF-based framework for rendering scenes in immersive VR, but it does not specify any datasets at this point.

Next, I will examine **section 4 (Performance Benchmarking)**, as this section is likely to contain details about the datasets used for benchmarking the framework. In **section 4.1**, the authors mention three different scenes used for evaluation:

1. **Lego Scene**: This scene is based on the original NeRF paper and contains 100 images of a Lego model with a resolution of 800 × 800 pixels.
2. **Fox Scene**: This scene is derived from the instant-ngp framework and consists of 50 images with a resolution of 1920 × 1080 pixels.
3. **Campus Scene**: This is a custom dataset collected by the authors, containing 126 images with a resolution of 4032 × 3024 pixels.

The authors provide specific details about the number of images and resolutions for each scene, which confirms that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. Since the Lego and Fox scenes are based on existing works, I will need to find the original papers that describe these datasets:

- For the **Lego Scene**, the original NeRF paper citation is:
  > B. Mildenhall, P. P. Srinivasan, M. Tancik, J. T. Barron, R. Ramamoorthy, and R. Ng. *NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis*. In ECCV, 2020.

- For the **Fox Scene**, the citation for the instant-ngp framework is:
  > T. Müller, A. Evans, C. Schied, and A. Keller. *Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding*. ACM Trans. Graph., 41(4):102:1–102:15, July 2022. doi: 10.1145/3528223.3530127.

- The **Campus Scene** is a custom dataset created by the authors, so it does not have a formal citation but should be noted as such.

After gathering all this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Lego Scene**: 100 images, 800 × 800 pixels resolution. Citation: Mildenhall et al. (2020).
2. **Fox Scene**: 50 images, 1920 × 1080 pixels resolution. Citation: Müller et al. (2022).
3. **Campus Scene**: 126 images, 4032 × 3024 pixels resolution. Custom dataset by the authors.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or analysis.
