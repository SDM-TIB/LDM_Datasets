To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Axonal Delay as a Short-Term Memory for Feed Forward Deep Spiking Neural Networks" by Pengfei Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on three neuromorphic benchmark datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, particularly subsection 3.2 (Datasets and Overall Results), where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **NMNIST**: This dataset is derived from the MNIST dataset and processed by a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). It contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 testing samples, with each sample having a duration of 300 ms and spatial dimensions of 34 × 34 pixels.

2. **DVS Gesture**: This dataset consists of recordings of 29 subjects performing 11 different hand and arm gestures using a DVS camera under varying illumination conditions. The authors used the first 23 subjects for training and the last 6 for testing.

3. **N-TDIDIGITS18**: This dataset is a neuromorphic version of the TDIDIGITS dataset, containing recordings of 11 spoken digits. The authors used a specific train-test split for their experiments.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **NMNIST**, the citation is:
  > Garrick Orchard, Ajinkya Jayawant, Gregory K Cohen, and Nitish Thakor. *Converting static image datasets to spiking neuromorphic datasets using saccades*. Frontiers in neuroscience, vol. 9, pp. 437, 2015.

- For **DVS Gesture**, the citation is:

- For **N-TDIDIGITS18**, the citation is:
  > Jithendar Anumula, Daniel Neil, Tobi Delbruck, and Shih-Chii Liu. *Feature representations for neuromorphic audio spike streams*. Frontiers in neuroscience, vol. 12, pp. 23, 2018.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and properly cited. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
