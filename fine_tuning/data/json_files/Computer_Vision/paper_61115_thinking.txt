To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Cinematic Mindscapes: High-quality Video Reconstruction from Brain Activity" by Zijiao Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of fMRI data and video reconstruction, which suggests that datasets related to fMRI and video clips may be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly discuss the datasets used. In this section, they mention two key datasets:

1. **Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1200 Subject Release**: This dataset is used for upstream pre-training and consists of resting-state and task-evoked fMRI data. The authors state that they obtained 600,000 fMRI segments from this dataset.

2. **Paired fMRI-Video dataset**: This dataset is described as a publicly available benchmark that includes fMRI and video clips. It consists of fMRI data collected from three subjects using a 3T MRI scanner, with a total of 4,320 paired training examples and 1,200 test fMRIs.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Human Connectome Project (HCP)**, the citation is:
  > Van Essen, D. C., Smith, S. M., Barch, D. M., Behrens, T. E., Yacoub, E., Ugurbil, K., & Consortium, W.-M. H. (2013). The Wu-Minn Human Connectome Project: An overview. *NeuroImage*, 80, 62-79.

- For the **Paired fMRI-Video dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wen, H., Shi, J., Zhang, Y., Lu, K.-H., Cao, J., & Liu, Z. (2018). Neural encoding and decoding with deep learning for dynamic natural vision. *Cerebral Cortex*, 28(12), 4136-4160.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the details necessary for future reference or analysis. This structured approach will help in organizing the dataset information effectively.
