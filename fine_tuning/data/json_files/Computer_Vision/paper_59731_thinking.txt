To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Video-Text as Game Players: Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction for Cross-Modal Representation Learning" by Peng Jin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval and video-question answering benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used. In this paper, they mention four datasets:

1. **MSRVTT**: This dataset contains 10,000 YouTube videos, each with 20 text descriptions. The authors follow a specific training protocol and evaluate on the 1K-A testing split.

2. **ActivityNet Captions**: This dataset consists of densely annotated temporal segments of 20,000 YouTube videos. The authors use a 10,000 training split and report performance on the 5K "val1" split.

3. **DiDeMo**: This dataset includes 10,000 videos annotated with 40,000 text descriptions. The authors concatenate descriptions of segments in a video to construct "video-paragraph" for retrieval.

4. **MSRVTT-QA**: This dataset is based on the MSRVTT dataset and contains 243,000 VideoQA pairs.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
