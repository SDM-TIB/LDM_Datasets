To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Credibility evaluation of income data with hierarchical correlation reconstruction" by JarosÅ‚aw Duda and Adam Szulc, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's objectives and methods, while the introduction often elaborates on the datasets used for analysis. In this case, the introduction mentions that the study uses data from the **Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS)**, which is a strong indicator that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section II (Dataset)**, where the author explicitly describes the dataset used in the study. Here, I find that the dataset consists of observations on **37,215 households** collected annually by GUS. The section details the variables included in the dataset, such as equivalent monthly income, age of the household head, education level, and various categorical and binary variables.

To ensure I have all necessary details, I will also check the **References section** for any citations related to the dataset. However, since the dataset is derived from a governmental source (GUS), it may not have a formal citation like academic datasets. Instead, I will note the source as follows:

- **Dataset**: Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS) - Household Budget Survey Data
  - Description: The dataset includes observations on 37,215 households, with 36 variables related to income, demographics, and expenditures.

Since the dataset is not published in a traditional academic format, I will provide the citation as a reference to the organization:

> Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS). *Household Budget Survey Data*. Available at: [https://stat.gov.pl/en/](https://stat.gov.pl/en/) (Accessed: [insert date]).

Now that I have identified the dataset and its source, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.

In summary, I have extracted the dataset information from the paper, ensuring to include a full citation for the source of the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution and reference.
