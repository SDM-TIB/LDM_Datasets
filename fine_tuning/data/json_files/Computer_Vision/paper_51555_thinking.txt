To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Image and Object Geo-localization" by Daniel Wilson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and sections discussing datasets** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview of the paper's focus on geo-localization, which suggests that datasets will be discussed in detail later.

Next, I will look specifically at **section 3 (Datasets)**, where the authors typically summarize the datasets used in their research. This section is likely to contain explicit mentions of datasets, their characteristics, and their relevance to the study.

In section 3, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **Im2GPS**: This dataset contains approximately 20 million images with GPS coordinates and geographic keywords. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Hays, J., & Efros, A. A. (2008). *Im2GPS: estimating geographic information from a single image*. Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

2. **City-Landmark**: This dataset includes over 150,000 GPS-tagged panoramic images in San Francisco. The citation is:
   > Chen, D. M., Baatz, G., Koser, K., Tsai, S. S., Vedantham, R., & Pylvanainen, T. (2011). *City-scale landmark identification on mobile devices*. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

3. **KITTI**: A popular dataset captured using a road vehicle with high-resolution cameras and GPS sensors. The citation is:
   > Geiger, A., Lenz, P., Stiller, C., & Urtasun, R. (2013). *Vision meets robotics: The KITTI dataset*. International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR).

4. **YFCC100M**: This dataset contains 99.2 million images and videos with GPS coordinates. The citation is:
   > Thomee, B., Shamma, D. A., Friedland, G., Elizalde, B., Ni, K., Poland, D., & Li, L.-J. (2016). *YFCC100M: The new data in multimedia research*. Commun. ACM.

5. **GeoPose3k**: A dataset designed for rural geo-localization techniques, containing over 3,000 images of the Alps. The citation is:
   > Brejcha, J., & Cadik, M. (2017). *GeoPose3k: Mountain landscape dataset for camera pose estimation in outdoor environments*. Image and Vision Computing.

After identifying these datasets, I will also check the **References section** to ensure I have the correct and complete citations for each dataset mentioned. This will help me compile a comprehensive list of datasets with their respective citations.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation, ready for further processing or review.
