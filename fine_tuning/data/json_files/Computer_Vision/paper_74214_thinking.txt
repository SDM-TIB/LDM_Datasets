To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Effect of Training Dataset Size on Discriminative and Diffusion-Based Speech Enhancement Systems" by Philippe Gonzalez et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the performance of speech enhancement systems and hints at the use of various datasets for training and evaluation.

Next, I will look closely at **section 3 (Dataset Generation)**, as this section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. Here, the authors mention generating noisy and reverberant mixtures using speech utterances, noise segments, and binaural room impulse responses from multiple corpora and databases. They specifically list the following speech corpora:

1. **TIMIT**: A well-known corpus for speech recognition.
2. **LibriSpeech**: A corpus based on public domain audiobooks.
3. **WSJ (Wall Street Journal)**: A corpus designed for speech recognition tasks.
4. **Clarity**: A dataset of British English speech recordings.
5. **VCTK**: A large regional accent speech database.

The paper also mentions noise databases and BRIR (Binaural Room Impulse Response) databases, which are crucial for generating the datasets. The noise databases include:

- **TAU**: Urban acoustic scenes dataset.
- **NOISEX**: A database to study the effect of additive noise on speech recognition.
- **ICRA**: Artificial noise signals for hearing instrument assessment.
- **DEMAND**: A multi-channel environmental noise database.
- **ARTE**: Ambisonic recordings of typical environments.

The BRIR databases mentioned are:

- **Surrey**
- **ASH**
- **BRAS**
- **CATT**
- **AVIL**

In addition to identifying the datasets, I will also need to find the full citations for each of these datasets. I will check the **References section** of the paper for the relevant citations. 

For example, I can find the following citations:

- **BRIR databases**: The citations for these databases can also be found in the references section, and I will extract them similarly.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
