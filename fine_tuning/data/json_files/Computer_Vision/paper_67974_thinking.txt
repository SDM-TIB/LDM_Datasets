To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Metric Depth with a Field-of-View Conditioned Diffusion Model" by Saurabh Saxena et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of zero-shot metric depth estimation and hints at the use of various datasets for evaluation. The introduction elaborates on the need for diverse datasets to train models effectively, which suggests that specific datasets will be referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention several datasets used for training and evaluation in the **experiments section (4.1)**. Here, they specify the datasets utilized for their model training and evaluation, which include:

1. **NYU Depth V2**: A dataset containing RGB-D images for indoor scene understanding.
2. **Sun RGB-D**: A dataset for RGB-D scene understanding that includes various indoor scenes.
3. **DIODE Indoor**: A dataset specifically designed for indoor depth estimation.
4. **iBims-1**: A benchmark dataset for indoor depth estimation.
5. **Hypersim**: A synthetic dataset for holistic indoor scene understanding.
6. **KITTI**: A well-known dataset for outdoor scene understanding and depth estimation.
7. **DIML Outdoor**: A dataset for outdoor depth estimation.
8. **Virtual KITTI 2**: A synthetic dataset for evaluating depth estimation methods.
9. **DDAD**: A dataset for outdoor depth estimation.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. Here are the citations I will extract:

Finally, I will compile the dataset names along with their full citations into a structured format for easy reference. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their citations from the paper.
