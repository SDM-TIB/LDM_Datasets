To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Inter-channel Conv-TasNet for multichannel speech enhancement" by Dongheon Lee et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the **CHiME-3 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments section**. In the experiments section, the authors explicitly state that they tested their models using the **CHiME-3 dataset**. They describe the dataset as being designed for speech enhancement and recognition tasks, created by mixing speech from a speaker positioned at different locations with outdoor noise recorded in various environments.

Now, I will gather the details about the **CHiME-3 dataset** from the text. The paper states that it contains 7,138 training utterances, 1,640 development utterances, and 1,320 test utterances, recorded using 6-channel microphones at a sampling rate of 16 kHz. This information is essential for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the CHiME-3 dataset. The relevant reference is:

- **CHiME-3 dataset citation**:
  > J. Barker, R. Marxer, E. Vincent, and S. Watanabe. "The third ‘CHiME’ speech separation and recognition challenge: Dataset, task and baselines." In IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding, Scottsdale, AZ, USA, 2015, pp. 504–511.

With this information, I can now summarize the dataset details and prepare to format them according to the required structure.

In summary, the steps I took include:
1. Reading the abstract and introduction to identify mentions of datasets.
2. Locating the experiments section to confirm the dataset used.
3. Gathering detailed information about the CHiME-3 dataset.
4. Retrieving the full citation from the references.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing.
