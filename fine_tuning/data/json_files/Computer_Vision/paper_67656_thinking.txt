To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Meta-Learning to Calibrate Gaussian Processes with Deep Kernels for Regression Uncertainty Estimation" by Tomoharu Iwata and Atsutoshi Kumagai, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of real-world datasets for experiments, which indicates that specific datasets will likely be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section. Here, the authors mention the importance of uncertainty estimation in regression tasks and refer to using data from various tasks. However, they do not specify dataset names yet.

I will then look into the **experiments** section, particularly **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for evaluation. They mention five datasets: **AHM**, **MAT**, **School**, **Tafeng**, and **Sales**. Each dataset is briefly described, including its context and characteristics.

1. **AHM Dataset**: This dataset consists of spatial data of the annual heat-moisture index in North America, obtained from a specific website. It includes 365 non-overlapping regions, with target values observed at 1 km grid squares.

2. **MAT Dataset**: Similar to AHM, this dataset contains spatial data of mean annual temperature in North America, also sourced from the same website as AHM.

3. **School Dataset**: This is a benchmark dataset in multi-task regression, containing examination scores from students across 139 schools, with a focus on schools having 60 or more students.

4. **Sales Dataset**: This dataset includes weekly purchased quantities of 811 products over 52 weeks, sourced from the UCI repository. The features consist of sales data from the previous five weeks.

5. **Tafeng Dataset**: Another grocery shopping dataset that contains transactions of 23,812 products over four months, structured similarly to the Sales dataset.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, the datasets themselves are not typically cited in the references; instead, they are described in the text. The authors provide the source for AHM and MAT datasets, which is:

- AHM and MAT: 
  > "Data obtained from https://sites.ualberta.ca/~ahamann/data/climatena.html"

For the School dataset, the authors reference it as a benchmark dataset but do not provide a specific citation. The Sales dataset is cited as coming from the UCI repository, but again, no specific citation is provided in the references.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring to include the descriptions and sources as needed. The full citations for datasets that have them will be noted, while others will be referenced based on the information provided in the paper.

In summary, I will create entries for each dataset, ensuring to include the relevant details and sources as outlined above.
