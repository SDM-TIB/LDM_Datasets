To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Multi-Task Oriented Semantic Communication Framework for Autonomous Vehicles" by Eslam Eldeeb, Mohammad Shehab, and Hirley Alves, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses a multi-task-oriented semantic communication framework for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), but it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** for any references to datasets. The introduction discusses the challenges and advancements in intelligent communication networks but does not provide specific dataset names.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any datasets used in the simulations. The paper mentions using the **Chinese Traffic Sign Database** for the experiments, which is a crucial dataset for the study. 

In the **numerical results and discussion section**, the authors refer to the Chinese Traffic Sign Database again, confirming its use in their experiments. This is the primary dataset utilized in their research.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Chinese Traffic Sign Database. The citation provided in the references is:
> "Chinese Traffic Sign Database," http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/trafficdata/recognition.html, accessed: June 14, 2023.

Since this is the only dataset mentioned in the paper, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Chinese Traffic Sign Database**: This dataset is used for training and testing the proposed semantic communication framework. It contains various traffic sign images essential for the classification and reconstruction tasks in the study.

With this information, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Chinese Traffic Sign Database, ensuring to include the full citation as required. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for further processing or review.
