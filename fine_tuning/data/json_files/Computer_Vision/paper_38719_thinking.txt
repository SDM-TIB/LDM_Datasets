To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Spherical CNNs on Unstructured Grids" by Chiyu “Max” Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on various tasks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for processing spherical signals and mention several applications, but I need to look for specific datasets. 

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Spherical MNIST)**, they mention using the **MNIST dataset**, which is a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition. I will note the details provided about how the dataset was adapted for their spherical CNN model.

In **Section 4.2 (3D Object Classification)**, the authors refer to the **ModelNet40 dataset**, which is a benchmark for 3D object classification tasks. I will extract the relevant details about how this dataset was utilized in their experiments.

In **Section 4.3 (Omnidirectional Image Segmentation)**, the authors mention using the **Stanford 2D3DS dataset**, which consists of equirectangular images with RGB+depth channels. I will document this dataset along with its specifics.

Finally, in **Section 4.4 (Climate Pattern Segmentation)**, the authors discuss their evaluation on climate data, specifically mentioning the use of outputs from the **Community Atmospheric Model v5 (CAM5)**. While this is not a dataset in the traditional sense, it is important to note the source of the data they used for their experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

NCAR Tech. Note NCAR/TN-486+ STR, 1(1):1–12, 2010.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their respective citations into a structured format for further processing or review.
