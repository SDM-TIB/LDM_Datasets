To extract datasets from the research paper titled "C-CLIP: Contrastive Image-Text Encoders to Close the Descriptive-Commentative Gap" by William Theisen and Walter Scheirer, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the need for training models on commentative text, which suggests that datasets related to social media posts are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the "Descriptive-Commentative Gap" and highlight the importance of commentative text in social media. This indicates that datasets used for their experiments may include both descriptive and commentative pairs.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two descriptive datasets and two commentative datasets:

1. **Microsoft's Common Objects in Context (COCO)**: This dataset is a standard image-caption dataset used for training models on descriptive pairs. It is widely recognized in the field of computer vision.

2. **Crossmodal 3600 (XM3600)**: This dataset is specifically designed to test multilingual multimodal models and includes captions in various languages.

3. **Brazilian Twitter dataset**: This dataset consists of tweets surrounding a series of protests in Brazil, containing 203,781 image-text pairs.

4. **Russian Telegram dataset**: This dataset includes posts related to the ongoing war in Ukraine, containing 4,766,631 image-text pairs.

In the **experiments section**, the authors confirm that these datasets were used to evaluate their models, providing further validation of their relevance.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to gather full citations for each dataset:

- For **Microsoft COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, Lubomir Bourdev, Ross Girshick, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, C. Lawrence Zitnick, and Piotr Dollár. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **Crossmodal 3600 (XM3600)**, the citation is:
  > Ashish V. Thapliyal, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Xi Chen, and Radu Soricut. *Crossmodal-3600: A Massively Multilingual Multimodal Evaluation Dataset*. 2022.

- For the **Brazilian Twitter dataset**, the citation is:
  > Josè Nascimento, João Phillipe Cardenuto, Jing Yang, and Anderson Rocha. *Few-shot Learning for Multi-modal Social Media Event Filtering*. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management (ISCRAM), 2022.

- For the **Russian Telegram dataset**, the citation is:
  > William Theisen, Daniel Gonzalez Cedre, Zachariah Carmichael, Daniel Moreira, Tim Weninger, and Walter Scheirer. *Motif Mining: Finding and Summarizing Remixed Image Content*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2023.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
