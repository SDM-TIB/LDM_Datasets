To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Regularized Autoencoder and its Application in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection" by Imtiaz Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract states that the proposed method is evaluated on **20 benchmark anomaly detection datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** or **performance analysis** sections. In the **performance analysis** section (specifically section 4.1), the authors summarize the characteristics of the 20 benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This section provides a clear list of datasets along with their attributes.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **Annthyroid**: 7,200 observations, 21 attributes, 347 anomalies.
2. **Arrhythmia**: 450 observations, 259 attributes, 12 anomalies.
3. **Cardiotocography**: 2,126 observations, 21 attributes, 86 anomalies.
4. **HeartDisease**: 270 observations, 13 attributes, 7 anomalies.
5. **Page Blocks**: 5,473 observations, 10 attributes, 99 anomalies.
6. **Parkinson**: 195 observations, 22 attributes, 5 anomalies.
7. **Pima**: 768 observations, 8 attributes, 26 anomalies.
8. **SpamBase**: 4,601 observations, 57 attributes, 280 anomalies.
9. **Stamps**: 340 observations, 9 attributes, 16 anomalies.
10. **WBC**: 454 observations, 9 attributes, 10 anomalies.
11. **Waveform**: 3,443 observations, 21 attributes, 100 anomalies.
12. **WPBC**: 198 observations, 33 attributes, 47 anomalies.
13. **WDBC**: 367 observations, 30 attributes, 10 anomalies.
14. **ALOI**: 50,000 observations, 27 attributes, 1,508 anomalies.
15. **KDD**: 60,632 observations, 41 attributes, 200 anomalies.
16. **Shuttle**: 1,013 observations, 9 attributes, 13 anomalies.
17. **Ionosphere**: 351 observations, 34 attributes, 126 anomalies.
18. **Glass**: 214 observations, 9 attributes, 20 anomalies.
19. **Pen digits**: 9,868 observations, 16 attributes, 6 anomalies.
20. **Lymphography**: 148 observations, 7 attributes, 6 anomalies.

Now, I will check the **References** section to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper cites the following references for the datasets:
