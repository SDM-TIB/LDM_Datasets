To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised End-to-End Learning of Discrete Linguistic Units for Voice Conversion" by Andy T. Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors achieved outstanding performance in the ZeroSpeech 2019 Challenge, which suggests that datasets related to this challenge may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **implementation** section, the authors explicitly state that they used the **ZeroSpeech 2019 English dataset** for training and evaluation. They mention using the "Train Unit Dataset" as the source speaker set, the "Train Voice Dataset" as the target speaker set, and the "Test Dataset" for evaluation.

Now, I will gather the full citations for these datasets from the **references** section. The relevant citation for the ZeroSpeech 2019 Challenge is:

- **ZeroSpeech 2019 English dataset**:
  > E. Dunbar, R. Algayres, J. Karadayi, M. Bernard, J. Benjumea, X.-N. Cao, L. Miskic, C. Dugrain, L. Ondel, A. W. Black, L. Besacier, S. Sakti, and E. Dupoux. *The Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2019: TTS without T*. In 20th Annual Conference of the International Speech Communication Association (INTERSPEECH 2019): Crossroads of Speech and Language, 2019. Available: https://zerospeech.com/2019/

I will also note that the authors refer to specific subsets of this dataset, namely the "Train Unit Dataset" and "Train Voice Dataset," but these are part of the larger ZeroSpeech dataset and do not have separate citations.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and that the full citations are included as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
