To extract datasets from the research paper titled "What is Where by Looking: Weakly-Supervised Open-World Phrase-Grounding without Text Inputs" by Tal Shaharabany, Yoad Tewel, and Lior Wolf, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the method is trained on **COCO images and their captions**, which suggests that the COCO dataset is one of the datasets used.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe their evaluation on various tasks, including weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) and weakly supervised phrase grounding (WSG). They mention using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset**, **Stanford Cars dataset**, and **Stanford Dogs dataset** for WSOL, and **MSCOCO** and **Visual Genome (VG)** for WSG.

I will also check the **datasets section** where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **CUB-200-2011 Dataset**: Contains 200 bird species with 11,788 images, split into 5,994 training images and 5,794 test images.
2. **Stanford Cars Dataset**: Comprises 196 categories of cars with 8,144 samples in the training set and 8,041 samples in the test set.
3. **Stanford Dogs Dataset**: Consists of 20,580 images, with 12,000 for training and 8,580 for testing, covering 120 classes of dogs.
4. **MSCOCO 2014 Dataset**: Contains 82,783 training images and 40,504 validation images, with each image having five captions.
5. **Visual Genome (VG) Dataset**: Includes 77,398 training images, 5,000 validation images, and 5,000 test images, with free-form text annotated bounding boxes.
6. **Flickr30k Entities**: Based on the Flickr30k dataset, it contains 224K phrases describing objects in over 31K images, each described by five captions.
7. **ReferIt Dataset**: Contains 20K images and 99,535 segmented images with descriptions for the entire image.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

Now, I will compile the dataset entries with their full citations for further processing.
