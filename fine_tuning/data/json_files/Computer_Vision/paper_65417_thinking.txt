To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RING-A-BELL! HOW RELIABLE ARE CONCEPT REMOVAL METHODS FOR DIFFUSION MODELS?" by Chia-Yi Hsu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions evaluating safety mechanisms using a specific dataset, which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly the subsection titled **"Dataset."** Here, the authors explicitly mention the **I2P dataset** (Schramowski et al., 2023), which is used for evaluating the performance of their proposed method. The I2P dataset consists of problematic prompts related to nudity and violence, which are crucial for their experiments.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the I2P dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Patrick Schramowski, Manuel Brack, Björn Deiseroth, and Kristian Kersting. *Safe latent diffusion: Mitigating inappropriate degeneration in diffusion models*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 22522–22531, 2023.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the dataset details, including its purpose and the context in which it was used in the experiments.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all necessary information is accurately captured for future reference or processing.
