To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A rigorous benchmarking of methods for SARS-CoV-2 lineage abundance estimation in wastewater," I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract indicates that the study benchmarks 18 bioinformatics methods using data from in vitro mixtures of synthetic lineage genomes and simulated data from clinical settings. This suggests that there are specific datasets used for the benchmarking.

Next, I will examine the **Methods** section, particularly focusing on the subsections that describe the datasets. Here, the authors mention the use of:

1. **In vitro mixtures of synthetic lineage genomes**: The paper states that they generated 16 in vitro mixtures containing combinations of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and sublineages. This indicates a dataset based on real experimental mixtures.

2. **Simulated datasets**: The authors describe the creation of 78 simulated mixtures of lineages and sublineages, which mirror the prevalence ratios observed in real data. This is another dataset that needs to be documented.

In the **Data Availability** section, the authors commit to uploading all simulated sequencing reads and raw data obtained from sequencing the in vitro mixtures to the Sequence Read Archive. This is crucial for understanding the datasets' accessibility.

Now, I will look for specific citations related to the datasets mentioned. The paper references the **GISAID database** for the lineage data, which is a critical source for the synthetic RNA genomes used in the in vitro mixtures. The relevant citation for GISAID is:

- Shu, Y. & McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data – from vision to reality. Eurosurveillance 22, 30494 (2017).

Additionally, I will check the references for any specific papers that describe the methods or datasets used in the benchmarking. The authors mention several bioinformatics tools and methods, each of which may have associated datasets or references.

For the **in vitro mixtures**, the authors used synthetic lineage genomes acquired from Twist Biosciences. The citation for this source is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I will note that it may need to be sourced directly from the company or relevant publications.

Finally, I will compile the identified datasets and their citations into a structured format for clarity. The datasets to be documented include:

1. **In vitro mixtures of synthetic lineage genomes**: 
   - Citation: Twist Biosciences (specific citation may need to be sourced).

2. **Simulated datasets from GISAID**:
   - Citation: Shu, Y. & McCauley, J. GISAID: Global initiative on sharing all influenza data – from vision to reality. Eurosurveillance 22, 30494 (2017).

After gathering all this information, I will ensure that each dataset is clearly described, and the citations are accurately formatted for inclusion in any subsequent documentation or analysis.
