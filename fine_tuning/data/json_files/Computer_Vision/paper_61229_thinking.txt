To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Impact of Light and Shadow on Robustness of Deep Neural Networks" by Chengyin Hu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors propose a **brightness-variation dataset** derived from a subset of ImageNet, which suggests that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (Methodology and experiments)**, where the authors describe the dataset generation process in detail. They mention that the proposed dataset is called **ImageNet-BrightnessVariation (ImageNet-BV)**, which consists of 50,000 clean images selected from the ImageNet Challenge dataset, with each image adjusted to 24 different brightness levels, resulting in a total of 1,200,000 images.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the original ImageNet dataset, as it is crucial to provide proper attribution. The citation for the ImageNet dataset is:

- **ImageNet**:
  > Deng, J., Dong, W., Socher, R., Li, L.J., Li, K., Fei-Fei, L. *ImageNet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In: 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. pp. 248â€“255. IEEE (2009).

Now, I will compile the information about the datasets into a structured format. The key dataset identified is:

1. **ImageNet-BrightnessVariation (ImageNet-BV)**: A dataset created from a subset of the ImageNet Challenge dataset, containing 50,000 images with 24 brightness variations for each image, totaling 1,200,000 images.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the ImageNet dataset included in my output. This process will allow me to accurately represent the datasets used in the research paper while adhering to proper citation practices.
