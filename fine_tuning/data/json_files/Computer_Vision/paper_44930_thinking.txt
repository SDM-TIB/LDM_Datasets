To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning a Deep Part-based Representation by Preserving Data Distribution" by Anyong Qin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the importance of unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction, but they do not explicitly mention any datasets yet. I will continue to the **experiments section** where datasets are typically detailed.

Upon reaching **section IV (Experiments)**, I will look for any specific mentions of datasets used in the experiments. The authors mention evaluating their method on several datasets, specifically:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: A well-known dataset of handwritten digits, consisting of 70,000 images (28x28 pixels).
2. **Coil-100 Dataset**: Contains 7,200 images of 100 objects, each viewed from different angles (128x128 pixels).
3. **YaleB Dataset**: A dataset of face images of 38 subjects, with variations in lighting and pose (192x168 pixels).
4. **Reuters21578 Dataset**: A collection of documents for text categorization.
5. **RCV1 Dataset**: A benchmark collection for text categorization research.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **MNIST Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Yann LeCun, Léon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, and Patrick Haffner. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition." *Proceedings of the IEEE*, vol. 86, no. 11, pp. 2278–2324, 1998.

- For the **Coil-100 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Shree K. Nene, Shree Nayar, and Hiroshi Murase. "Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100)." *Columbia University*, Technical Report CUCS-006-96, 1996.

- For the **YaleB Dataset**, the citation is:
  > A. S. Georghiades, P. N. Belhumeur, and D. J. Kriegman. "From few to many: illumination cone models for face recognition under variable lighting and pose." *IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence*, vol. 23, no. 6, pp. 643–660, 2001.

- For the **Reuters21578 Dataset**, the citation is:
  > David D. Lewis, Ying Yang, Thomas G. Rose, and Fan Li. "RCV1: A new benchmark collection for text categorization research." *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 361–397, 2004.

- For the **RCV1 Dataset**, the citation is the same as for the Reuters21578 Dataset since it is part of the same collection.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured all relevant datasets and their full citations from the paper.
