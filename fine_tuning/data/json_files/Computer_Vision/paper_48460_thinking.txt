To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The use of Generative Adversarial Networks to characterise new physics in multi-lepton final states at the LHC" by Thabang Lebese and Xifeng Ruan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or data sources.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly **section 4 (MC samples & GAN training)**, where the authors describe their approach to data preparation and processing. Here, they mention generating collider events using specific programs, which indicates that they are working with datasets derived from Monte Carlo simulations.

In **sub-section 4.2 (Data preparation and processing)**, the authors detail the generation of collider events using programs like **MadGraph** and **Pythia**, which are crucial for simulating high-energy physics events. They also mention the use of **Delphes** for simulating detector responses. This indicates that the datasets are derived from these simulations.

I will note the specific datasets mentioned:
1. **MadGraph**: Used for generating hard scattering events.
2. **Pythia**: Used for simulating parton showers and hadronization processes.
3. **Delphes**: Used for fast simulation of detector processes.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these tools, as they are essential for understanding the datasets used in the study. The citations for these tools are as follows:

- For **MadGraph**:
  > J. Alwall, M. Herquet, F. Maltoni, O. Mattelaer, and T. Stelzer. "MadGraph 5: Going Beyond." *JHEP* 06 (2011), 128. arXiv:1106.0522 [hep-ph].

- For **Pythia**:
  > T. Sjostrand, S. Mrenna, and P. Z. Skands. "A Brief Introduction to PYTHIA 8.1." *Comput. Phys. Commun.* 178 (2008), 852-867. arXiv:0710.3820 [hep-ph].

- For **Delphes**:
  > J. de Favereau et al. [DELPHES 3]. "DELPHES 3, A modular framework for fast simulation of a generic collider experiment." *JHEP* 02 (2014), 057. arXiv:1307.6346 [hep-ex].

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

In summary, I have extracted the following datasets from the paper:
1. **MadGraph** - for generating hard scattering events.
2. **Pythia** - for simulating parton showers and hadronization.
3. **Delphes** - for simulating detector responses.

I will ensure to include the full citations for each dataset as they are crucial for proper referencing in any subsequent analysis or reporting.
