To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Dopamine Transporter SPECT Image Classification for Neurodegenerative Parkinsonism via Diffusion Maps and Machine Learning Classifiers" by Jun-En Ding et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses the **Parkinsonism Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)** dataset and a clinical cohort from **Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (KCGMH-TW)**. This suggests that these datasets are crucial for the research.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **PPMI Dataset**: This dataset is described as a longitudinal, multicenter study assessing the progression of clinical features, imaging, and biological markers in PD patients and healthy controls. It includes 876 PD subjects and 414 healthy controls (HC). The dataset is accessible at the PPMI website (http://www.ppmi-info.org).

2. **KCGMH-TW Dataset**: This dataset consists of 730 patients who underwent SPECT imaging at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and it includes detailed imaging protocols and patient demographics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **PPMI Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative. *The Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)*. Available at: http://www.ppmi-info.org.

- For the **KCGMH-TW Dataset**, since it is a clinical cohort from a specific hospital, I will cite the relevant study that describes the dataset:
  > Ding, J.-E., Chu, C.-H., Huang, M.-N.L., & Hsu, C.-C. (2023). *Dopamine Transporter SPECT Image Classification for Neurodegenerative Parkinsonism via Diffusion Maps and Machine Learning Classifiers*. [Journal Name, Volume(Issue), Page Range]. DOI or URL if available.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations. This will ensure that all necessary information is captured for future reference or analysis.
