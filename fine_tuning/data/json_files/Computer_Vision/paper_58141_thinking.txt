To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MIND THE GAP - MODELLING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CENSORED AND UNCENSORED ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING DEMAND" by Frederik Boe Hüttel, Filipe Rodrigues, and Francisco Câmara Pereira, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the study uses **GPS trajectories from cars in Copenhagen, Denmark**, which suggests that this is a primary dataset.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **introduction**. The authors discuss the use of GPS trajectories and charging station data, which reinforces the idea that these are key datasets for their analysis.

In **section 4 (Counterfactual study)**, the authors provide detailed information about the dataset used for their counterfactual study. They mention that the dataset consists of **GPS trajectories from 32,664 internal combustion engine (ICE) cars in Denmark**, collected over three months from September to November 2019. This section also describes how the data was processed and anonymized to protect user privacy.

Additionally, the authors mention the **charging infrastructure data** scraped from an open-source map, which includes locations and power ratings of charging stations in Copenhagen. This data is crucial for modeling the charging demand.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **GPS trajectories dataset**, the citation is:
   > Statistics Denmark. *Statistikbanken - Statistics Denmark*. [Statistik-Banken, 2022].

2. For the **charging infrastructure data**, the citation is:
   > Uppladdning. *Source: https://www.uppladdning.nu/*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as specified. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
