To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Model for Small Molecules with Latent Space RL Fine-Tuning to Protein Targets" by Ulrich A. Mbou Sob et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "large publicly available SMILES dataset" and specifically references the SAFE dataset, which indicates that datasets are indeed discussed.

Next, I will look closely at **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors detail their methodology. In this section, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **SAFE Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the largest publicly available SMILES datasets, containing over 1 billion molecules curated from various sources, including the ZINC and UniCHEM libraries. The authors state that they used the first 21 parquet files from this dataset, resulting in approximately 150 million small molecules after filtering.

2. **ZINC250k Dataset**: This dataset comprises 250,000 small drug-like molecules from the ZINC database. The authors used this dataset for fine-tuning their model, maintaining consistency with previous work referenced in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **SAFE dataset**, the citation is:
  > Noutahi, E., Gabellini, C., Craig, M., Lim, J. S., & Tossou, P. (2024). Gotta be safe: A new framework for molecular design. *Digital Discovery*.

- For the **ZINC250k dataset**, the citation is:
  > Irwin, J. J., & Shoichet, B. K. (2005). ZINC - a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening. *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*, 45(1), 177-182.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
