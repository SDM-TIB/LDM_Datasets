To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Flexible Music-Conditioned Dance Generation with Style Description Prompts" by Hongsong Wang, Yin Zhu, and Xin Geng, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the work but may not contain specific dataset names. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets used in prior work.

Next, I will focus on **section V (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I find that the authors mention the **AIST++ dataset**, which is crucial for their experiments. They describe it as containing 1,408 high-quality dance movements synchronized with music from 10 genres, with varying durations.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the AIST++ dataset. The citation is as follows:
> R. Li, S. Yang, D. A. Ross, and A. Kanazawa. *Ai choreographer: Music conditioned 3d dance generation with aist++*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, 2021, pp. 13 401â€“13 412.

Since the AIST++ dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile this information into a structured format.

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:
1. **AIST++ Dataset**: This dataset includes 1,408 high-quality dance movements synchronized with music from 10 genres, with motion sequences of varying durations.

Finally, I will ensure that I have the full citation for the dataset ready for inclusion in any structured output or documentation.
