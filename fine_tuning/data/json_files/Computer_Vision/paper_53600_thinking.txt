To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Utterance Weighted Multi-Dilation Temporal Convolutional Networks for Monaural Speech Dereverberation" by William Ravenscroft et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the best performance was achieved on the **WHAMR dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for the experiments.

Next, I will look into **section 3 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors describe the data used for their experiments. Here, they specify that they used the **WHAMR noisy reverberant two speaker speech separation corpus**. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing, as well as the process of generating the reverberant signals.

In this section, the authors mention:
- The training set contains **20,000 samples**.
- The validation set contains **5,000 samples** (14.65 hours).
- The test set contains **3,000 samples** (9 hours).

This confirms that the WHAMR dataset is the primary dataset used in their experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the WHAMR dataset. The relevant citation is:
> Maciejewski, M., Wichern, G., & Le Roux, J. (2020). *WHAMR!: Noisy and reverberant single-channel speech separation*. In ICASSP 2020, May 2020.

Since the WHAMR dataset is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about it, including its citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry according to the required format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the WHAMR dataset. This will ensure that the dataset information is complete and properly referenced for any future use or analysis.
