To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Consistency and Correctness of Sequence Inpainting using Semantically Guided Generative Adversarial Network" by Avisek Lahiri et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors applied their method to the **CelebA** and **Youtube Faces** datasets, which suggests that these are the primary datasets used in their experiments.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology** or **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention using the **CelebA dataset**, which contains 202,599 face images, and they separated 2,000 images for testing. They also mention using the **Youtube Faces dataset** for preliminary experiments on video inpainting.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the research.

1. For the **CelebA dataset**, the citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 3730–3738, 2015.

2. For the **Youtube Faces dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lior Wolf, Tal Hassner, and Ido Maoz. *Face Recognition in Unconstrained Videos with Matched Background Similarity*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 529–534, 2011.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **CelebA Dataset**: A large-scale face dataset with 202,599 images, used for training and testing the proposed inpainting method.
- **Youtube Faces Dataset**: A dataset containing video sequences of celebrities, used for preliminary experiments in video inpainting.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ready for structured output or further processing.
