To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Lecture Notes in Probabilistic Diffusion Models" by Inga StrÃ¼mke and Helge Langseth, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. These sections often provide a summary of the research and may mention any datasets used in the study. In this case, the abstract does not explicitly mention any datasets, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will carefully read through the **main body of the paper**, particularly focusing on sections that discuss experiments, methodologies, or results. I will look for any references to datasets used for training or evaluation purposes. 

As I read through the paper, I will pay special attention to any figures, tables, or equations that might reference datasets. If the authors mention specific datasets, I will note their names, descriptions, and any relevant details about their usage in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

If the paper refers to well-known datasets, I will ensure to include their standard citations. For example, if the authors mention using the CIFAR-10 dataset, I would include the citation:
> Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research*. 2009.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will format the extracted information in a clear and organized manner, ready for further processing or review.
