To extract datasets from the research paper titled "HyperSDFusion: Bridging Hierarchical Structures in Language and Geometry for Enhanced 3D Text2Shape Generation" by Zhiying Leng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on an existing text-to-shape paired dataset, specifically the **Text2Shape dataset**. This indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors state that they conducted experiments on the **Text2Shape dataset**. They describe it as a widely used dataset in paired text-to-shape generation, which provides rich natural language annotations for various shapes.

I will also check the **related works section** to see if there are any other datasets referenced. The authors mention that the Text2Shape dataset was proposed by Chen et al. in 2018, which provides a clear citation for this dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citation for the Text2Shape dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Kevin Chen, Christopher B Choy, Manolis Savva, Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, and Silvio Savarese. *Text2shape: Generating shapes from natural language by learning joint embeddings*. In ACCV, 2018.

Additionally, I will check if there are any other datasets mentioned in the paper. The authors also mention using the **ShapeNet dataset** for training their 3D VQ-VAE model. I will look for its citation as well.

The citation for the ShapeNet dataset is:
> Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

Now that I have identified and retrieved the full citations for both datasets, I will summarize the findings:

1. **Text2Shape Dataset**: A paired text-shape dataset widely used for text-to-shape generation.
   - Citation: Kevin Chen, Christopher B Choy, Manolis Savva, Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, and Silvio Savarese. *Text2shape: Generating shapes from natural language by learning joint embeddings*. In ACCV, 2018.

2. **ShapeNet Dataset**: A repository of 3D models used for training the 3D VQ-VAE model.
   - Citation: Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

With this information, I can now proceed to create structured entries for each dataset as needed.
