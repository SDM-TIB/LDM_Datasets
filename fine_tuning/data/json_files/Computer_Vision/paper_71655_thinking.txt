To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PROBELM: Plausibility Ranking Evaluation for Language Models" by Zhangdie Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that PROBELM is constructed from a dataset curated from **Wikidata edit histories**, which indicates that there is a specific dataset involved.

Next, I will examine **section 3 (PROBELM Construction)**, where the authors describe how the PROBELM benchmark is created. They mention that the dataset consists of scenarios collected from **Wikidata**, which is crucial for understanding the dataset's origin and purpose. The authors also explain that the dataset includes both **most plausible scenarios** and **less plausible scenarios**, generated through specific methodologies.

In **section 4 (PROBELM as a Plausibility Benchmark)**, the authors detail the evaluation setup and the number of scenarios sampled from Wikidata, indicating that they have created a substantial dataset for their experiments. They mention that they sampled **126,000 scenarios** from various timestamps, which is significant for the dataset's scale.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The primary dataset referenced is the **Wikidata edit histories**, which does not have a traditional citation format like other datasets. However, I can provide a general citation for Wikidata as follows:

- **Wikidata**: 
  > Wikimedia Foundation. *Wikidata: A free collaborative knowledge base*. Available at: https://www.wikidata.org/

Additionally, the authors reference various models and benchmarks that utilize the dataset, but these are not datasets themselves. 

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets identified in the paper, ensuring to include the full citation for the **Wikidata** dataset as it is the primary source for the scenarios used in the PROBELM benchmark.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
