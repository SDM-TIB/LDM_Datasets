To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometrically Principled Connections in Graph Neural Networks" by Shunwang Gong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but the introduction often contains more detailed references to datasets used in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss their contributions and the context of their work, but I need to look for specific mentions of datasets. I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for tasks such as shape reconstruction, mesh correspondence, or graph classification.

Next, I will focus on the **experimental evaluation section** (Section 5), where the authors describe their experiments in detail. Here, they mention specific datasets used for various tasks. For instance, they refer to the **CoMA dataset** for mesh reconstruction and the **FAUST dataset** for mesh correspondence. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, including the number of samples, training/test splits, and any specific characteristics mentioned.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

From my reading, I identify the following datasets:

1. **CoMA Dataset**: Used for mesh reconstruction tasks. The authors mention that it consists of a set of 3D meshes and is split into training and test sets with a ratio of 9:1.

2. **FAUST Dataset**: Used for mesh correspondence tasks. This dataset contains 10 scanned human shapes in 10 different poses, resulting in a total of 100 non-watertight meshes with 6,890 nodes each. The first 80 subjects are used for training, and the remaining 20 for testing.

Now, I will retrieve the full citations for these datasets from the References section:

- For the **CoMA dataset**, the citation is:
  > Anurag Ranjan, Timo Bolkart, Soubhik Sanyal, and Michael J. Black. *Generating 3D Faces using Convolutional Mesh Autoencoders*. In The European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), September 2018.

- For the **FAUST dataset**, the citation is:
  > Federica Bogo, Javier Romero, Matthew Loper, and Michael J. Black. *FAUST: Dataset and evaluation for 3D mesh registration*. In Proceedings IEEE Conf. on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Piscataway, NJ, USA, June 2014.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that I have accurately represented the datasets used in the research paper.
