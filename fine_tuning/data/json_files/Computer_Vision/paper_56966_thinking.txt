To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "PAANet: Visual Perception based Four-stage Framework for Salient Object Detection using High-order Contrast Operator" by Yanbo Yuan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract states that comparative experiments were conducted on **5 datasets**, which indicates that there are multiple datasets to look for.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, where the authors provide detailed information about the datasets used for training and evaluation. Here, they mention:

1. **DUTS-TR Dataset**: This dataset is described as the largest and most commonly used dataset for salient object detection, containing 10,553 training images and respective ground truth.

2. **DUT-OMRON Dataset**: This dataset contains 5,168 natural images, most of which have one or two objects with complex structures.

3. **HKU-IS Dataset**: This dataset includes 4,447 natural images, with multiple foreground objects in every image.

4. **ECSSD Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1,000 natural images, most of which have large and structurally complex foreground objects.

5. **SOD Dataset**: This is a small-scale challenging dataset originally designed for image segmentation, consisting of 300 images.

6. **PASCAL-S Dataset**: This dataset is noted as the most challenging, including 850 images, most of which have complex foreground objects and cluttered backgrounds.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
