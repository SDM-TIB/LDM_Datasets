To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Distilling Knowledge from Deep Networks with Applications to Healthcare Domain" by Zhengping Che et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments. 

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset Descriptions)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the experiments. In this section, the authors describe the **VENT dataset**, which consists of data from 398 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The dataset includes 27 static features and 21 temporal features recorded daily during the initial 4 days of mechanical ventilation.

I will take note of the specific details provided about the VENT dataset, including the number of patients, types of features, and any relevant statistics about missing values or imputation methods used.

After gathering the dataset information, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VENT dataset. The citation is crucial for proper attribution and will typically include the authors, title, publication venue, and year.

The citation for the VENT dataset is:
> Khemani, R. G., Conti, D., Alonzo, T. A., Bart, R. D., & Newth, C. J. (2009). Effect of tidal volume in children with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. *Intensive Care Medicine*, 35(8), 1428-1437.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines the dataset's name, description, and citation.

Finally, I will ensure that all extracted information is accurate and ready for any further processing or review.
