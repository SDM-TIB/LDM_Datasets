To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MS-TCN++: Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network for Action Segmentation" by Shijie Li et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. In the abstract, the authors mention that their models achieve state-of-the-art results on three datasets: **50Salads, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), and the Breakfast dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are crucial for their evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, specifically looking for a subsection that discusses the datasets in detail. In this section, the authors provide descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **50Salads**: This dataset consists of 50 videos featuring 17 action classes related to salad preparation activities, recorded from a top view. Each video has an average length of 6.4 minutes and contains about 20 action instances.

2. **Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA)**: This dataset includes 28 videos corresponding to 7 different activities, such as preparing coffee or cheese sandwiches, performed by 4 subjects. The videos are recorded from an egocentric perspective, and each video has an average of 20 action instances.

3. **Breakfast Dataset**: This is the largest dataset among the three, containing 1,712 videos recorded in 18 different kitchens, showcasing breakfast preparation activities. There are 48 different actions, with each video containing an average of 6 action instances.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- For **50Salads**, the citation is:
  > Stein, S., & McKenna, S. J. (2013). Combining embedded accelerometers with computer vision for recognizing food preparation activities. In ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (pp. 729–738).

- For **GTEA**, the citation is:
  > Fathi, A., Ren, X., & Rehg, J. M. (2011). Learning to recognize objects in egocentric activities. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 3281–3288).

- For **Breakfast Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kuehne, H., Arslan, A., & Serre, T. (2014). The language of actions: Recovering the syntax and semantics of goal-directed human activities. In IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (pp. 780–787).

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile this into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that all details are accurately represented.
