To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Point Contrastive Prediction with Semantic Clustering for Self-Supervised Learning on Point Cloud Videos" by Xiaoxiao Sheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the datasets used.

In the **experiments section**, specifically **section 4.1 (Datasets and Pre-training Details)**, the authors explicitly list the datasets utilized for their experiments. Here, I will find detailed descriptions of each dataset, including their characteristics and the specific tasks they are used for.

The datasets mentioned in this paper are:

1. **MSRAction-3D**: This dataset records 567 human action sequences captured using Kinect, covering 20 action categories performed by 10 subjects. The authors mention that they used 270 training videos and 297 test videos.

2. **NTU-RGBD**: This dataset consists of 56,880 videos recorded by three cameras from different angles, featuring 40 subjects and 60 action categories. The authors specify that they used 40,320 training videos and 16,560 test videos under a cross-subject setting.

3. **Synthia 4D**: This dataset contains 6 videos of various driving scenarios generated from the Synthia dataset. The authors indicate that it is split into 19,888 training frames, 815 validation frames, and 1,886 test frames.

4. **NvGesture**: This dataset includes 1,532 dynamic sequences across 25 categories. The authors state that they used 1,050 training videos and 482 test videos.

Next, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations for the datasets are:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that is ready for review or further processing.
