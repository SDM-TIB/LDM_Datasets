To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ensemble Quadratic Assignment Network for Graph Matching" by Haoru Tan et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets, while the experimental sections typically detail the datasets employed in the experiments.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are critical for the experiments or comparisons made by the authors. If the authors mention specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their names, sizes, and any specific characteristics that are relevant to the study. I will pay close attention to any subsections that explicitly mention datasets, as they often provide the most comprehensive information.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and allows others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the authors mention using the **PASCAL-PF dataset** for geometric graph matching, I will look for the citation in the references. The citation might look something like this:
> Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Chris Williams, John Winn, Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision, 88(2), 303â€“338, 2010.

Similarly, if they mention the **ModelNet40 dataset** for few-shot 3D shape classification, I will find its citation:
> Wu, Zhirong, et al. *3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2015.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference.

In summary, my step-by-step approach will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and experimental sections to identify datasets.
2. Note down any datasets mentioned, including their characteristics.
3. Check the references for full citations of each dataset.
4. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and ease of access.
