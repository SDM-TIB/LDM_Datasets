To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "CEmb-SAM: Segment Anything Model with Condition Embedding for Joint Learning from Heterogeneous Datasets" by Dongik Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, method, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract indicates that the paper discusses the segmentation of ultrasound images, which suggests that datasets related to ultrasound images are likely included.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the need for separate datasets to segment different anatomical structures or lesions. They specifically refer to datasets for peripheral nerves and breast ultrasound images, which indicates that these are the datasets of interest.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. They mention two primary datasets:

1. **Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI)**: This dataset consists of 780 images categorized into three sub-groups: benign, malignant, and normal. The average image size is 500 × 500 pixels.

2. **Peripheral Nerve Dataset**: This dataset includes ultrasound images of two anatomical structures: the peroneal nerve and the ulnar nerve. The peroneal nerve dataset contains 410 images, while the ulnar nerve dataset has 1234 images. The average image sizes are 494 × 441 pixels for the peroneal nerve and 477 × 435 pixels for the ulnar nerve.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI)** dataset, the citation is:
  > Al-Dhabyani, W., Gomaa, M., Khaled, H., Fahmy, A. (2020). Dataset of breast ultrasound images. *Data in brief*, 28, 104863.

- The **Peripheral Nerve Dataset** does not have a specific citation provided in the references, as it was created by the authors at their institution. Therefore, I will note that it is an institutional dataset without a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for the BUSI dataset and noting the institutional nature of the peripheral nerve dataset. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
