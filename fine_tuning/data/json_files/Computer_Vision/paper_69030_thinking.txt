To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffutoon: High-Resolution Editable Toon Shading via Diffusion Models" by Chengyu Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the challenges in video stylization and mentions the evaluation of the proposed method, Diffutoon, through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. However, it does not explicitly mention any datasets.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this section, the authors state that they created a dataset comprising **10 videos sourced from a video platform**. This indicates that there is a dataset involved, but I need to find more specific details about it.

I will also check the **conclusion** and **references** sections for any additional information regarding the dataset. The conclusion summarizes the contributions of the paper but does not provide further details about the dataset. The references section lists various works cited throughout the paper, but it does not seem to include a specific citation for the dataset itself.

Since the paper mentions that the dataset will be released publicly, I will note that down as it may be available for further exploration. However, the lack of a formal citation in the references means I cannot provide a full citation for the dataset at this time.

In summary, the only dataset mentioned is a collection of **10 videos sourced from a video platform**, but no formal citation is provided in the paper. I will document this information as follows:

- **Dataset Name**: 10 videos sourced from a video platform
- **Description**: A dataset created for evaluating the Diffutoon method, consisting of 10 videos.
- **Citation**: Not available (the dataset is mentioned to be released publicly but lacks a formal citation).

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
