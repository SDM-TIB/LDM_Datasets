To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fabric Image Representation Encoding Networks for Large-scale 3D Medical Image Analysis" by Siyu Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained their model on multiple medical image datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **Methods** section, particularly the **Experiment Setups** subsection, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention two key experiments:

1. **Prostate MR Imaging Segmentation**: The authors state that the dataset consists of 211 MR examinations from 39 patients, specifically for prostate cancer radiotherapy treatment. This dataset is crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed method.

2. **Multi-dataset Bone Segmentation**: The authors mention that they trained their model on four different musculoskeletal datasets: Knee, Shoulder, Hip, and the OAI ZIB Knee dataset. This indicates that they utilized multiple datasets to demonstrate the generalizability of their model.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **Prostate MR Imaging Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dowling, J. A., Sun, J., Pichler, P., Rivest-HÃ©nault, D., Ghose, S., Richardson, H., Wratten, C., Martin, J., Arm, J., Best, L., Chandra, S. S., Fripp, J., & Greer, P. B. (2015). Automatic substitute computed tomography generation and contouring for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-alone external beam radiation therapy from standard MRI sequences. *International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics*, 93(5), 1144-1153.

- For the **Knee, Shoulder, Hip, and OAI ZIB Knee datasets**, the citation for the OAI dataset is:
  > The Osteoarthritis Initiative. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://nda.nih.gov/oai/about-oai

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, along with their authoritative references.
