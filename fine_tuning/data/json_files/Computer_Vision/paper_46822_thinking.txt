To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Understanding Cache Boundness of ML Operators on ARM Processors" by Bernhard Klein et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study's focus, but it does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction discusses various machine learning techniques and frameworks but does not reference specific datasets either.

Next, I will proceed to the **methodological setup** and **performance baseline** sections. Here, the authors describe their experimental setup and the operators they benchmarked. However, they primarily focus on the performance of different computational techniques rather than specific datasets.

I will then look into the **results** and **performance analysis** sections. These sections detail the experiments conducted, including the performance of GEMM and convolution operators. While they provide extensive performance metrics and comparisons, they do not mention any datasets used for training or testing.

After reviewing the entire paper, it appears that the authors did not utilize any publicly available datasets for their experiments. Instead, they focused on benchmarking the performance of various operators on ARM processors without referencing specific datasets.

Since no datasets are mentioned in the paper, I will not be able to provide full citations for any datasets. However, I will summarize the findings related to the performance of the operators tested, as this is the primary focus of the research.

In conclusion, I will document that no datasets were extracted from this paper, and I will note the absence of dataset citations in my final output.
