To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Non-native Quantum Generative Optimization with Adversarial Autoencoders" by Blake A. Wilson et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or simulations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments and results sections**. These sections typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used, including their characteristics, sizes, and any specific configurations relevant to the study. I will look for explicit mentions of datasets, including any figures or tables that might summarize this information.

In the **methodology section**, the authors may describe how they generated or utilized datasets for their experiments. This could include synthetic datasets created for the purpose of the study or real-world datasets that were analyzed.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial as it provides the necessary context and source for the datasets used in the research.

For this paper, I will look for the following datasets:

1. **Designs for periodic metasurfaces**: The paper mentions using a dataset of designs sampled from a distribution over the design space. I will need to find the original source or publication that describes this dataset.

2. **Training dataset for the convolutional neural network predictor**: The authors state that they used topology optimized unit cells for a thermophotovoltaic application. I will need to find the citation for this dataset as well.

3. **Numerical simulations**: The paper discusses simulations based on a 12-atom Rydberg system. I will check if there are any datasets associated with this simulation that are referenced.

Once I have identified the datasets and their sources, I will compile the full citations for each dataset. This will ensure that I have a complete and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its citation for easy reference in future work.
