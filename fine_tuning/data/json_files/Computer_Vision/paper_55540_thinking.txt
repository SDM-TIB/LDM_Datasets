To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Subdiffusive Semantic Evolution in Indo-European Languages" by Bogdán Asztalos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and while it may not detail specific datasets, it sets the context for what is being studied.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the significance of their research and may reference specific datasets used for their analysis. I will look for any mentions of data sources, particularly those related to the Google Ngram dataset, as this is a key component of their methodology.

In the **methods section**, the authors describe their data processing pipeline and the specific datasets they utilized. Here, I will pay close attention to any detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their characteristics, size, and the languages involved. The authors mention using the Google Books Ngram Viewer database, which is crucial for their analysis.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional context or references to datasets that may have been used in the analysis. This section often provides insights into how the datasets were applied in the experiments and may include comparisons across different languages.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. For example, the Google Ngram dataset is a well-known resource, and I will ensure to provide its proper citation.

The key datasets I expect to extract from this paper include:

1. **Google Books Ngram Viewer Dataset**: This dataset is used for analyzing word usage over time across multiple languages. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Jean-Baptiste Michel, Yuan Kui Shen, Aviva Presser Aiden, Adrian Veres, Matthew K Gray, Joseph P Pickett, Dale Hoiberg, Dan Clancy, Peter Norvig, Jon Orwant, et al. *Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books*. Science, 331(6014):176–182, 2011.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes a clear description and the full citation for each dataset, ready for structured output or further processing.
