To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AI for DevSecOps: A Landscape and Future Opportunities" by Michael Fu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document any datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's focus, and the introduction often outlines the key research questions and objectives, which may hint at the datasets used in the study.

Next, I will examine the **methodology section** (specifically section 3) to see if the authors describe any datasets used for their systematic literature review (SLR). This section typically details the search strategy and selection criteria, which may include specific datasets or sources of data.

I will also look for any **tables or figures** that might summarize the datasets or studies included in the review. For instance, if there is a table that lists the papers analyzed, it may also indicate the datasets they utilized.

In the **results and discussion sections**, I will pay close attention to any mentions of datasets used in the analysis of AI-driven security approaches. The authors may discuss specific datasets in relation to their findings or challenges encountered.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to find full citations for any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

After gathering all relevant information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as mentioned in the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

By following these steps, I will ensure that I accurately extract and document the datasets referenced in the paper, along with their proper citations.
