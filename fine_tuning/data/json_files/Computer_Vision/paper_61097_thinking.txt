To extract datasets from the research paper titled "RMSSinger: Realistic-Music-Score based Singing Voice Synthesis" by Jinzheng He et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the collection of a new dataset containing realistic music scores and singing voices, which indicates that there is a dataset to extract.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors discuss the challenges in existing singing voice synthesis methods and the need for a new dataset. They mention that they collected a high-quality Chinese song corpus with realistic music scores, which is a key dataset for their research.

In the **experiments section**, specifically section 5.1, the authors provide details about the dataset they collected. They state that it consists of about 12 hours of recordings from professional singers, which were annotated for word durations and included silence and aspirate parts. This section confirms the dataset's significance and provides context for its use in their experiments.

Now, I will look for the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. However, since the dataset is newly collected and not publicly available, it may not have a formal citation like established datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:
- **Dataset Name**: High-quality Chinese song corpus
- **Description**: A dataset containing approximately 12 hours of singing recordings from professional singers, annotated with realistic music scores. The recordings include word durations, silence, and aspirate parts, and were collected in a professional studio setting.
- **Citation**: Since this dataset is newly created and not publicly available, it does not have a formal citation. However, I will reference the paper itself for context.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference. This will ensure that I have captured all necessary details about the dataset used in the research.
