To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Diffusion Map Particle Systems for Generative Modeling" by Fengyi Li and Youssef Marzouk, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions a novel method for generative modeling, but it does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the **experiments section** where datasets are likely to be detailed.

In **section 8 (Numerical Experiments)**, the authors describe several experiments that utilize specific datasets. I will carefully note the datasets mentioned in each subsection:

1. **Mickey Mouse Dataset**: This dataset is described as a uniform distribution over a compactly supported Mickey mouse-shaped domain. The authors mention using both 1000 and 2000 training samples for their experiments.

2. **Two Moons Dataset**: This dataset is characterized as a uniform distribution on a two-moon-shaped domain. The authors specify using 500 and 1000 training samples for their experiments.

3. **Arc Dataset**: This dataset consists of data points lying on an arc of radius 1 embedded in R3. The authors use both 100 and 1000 training samples for this experiment.

4. **Hyper-Semisphere Dataset**: This dataset involves data uniformly sampled on a half-sphere embedded in various ambient dimensions (d = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15). The authors use 1000 training samples and 300 generated particles for their experiments.

5. **Gluon Jet Dataset**: This dataset is derived from high energy physics, specifically for generating relative angular coordinates and transverse momenta of elementary particles produced in a gluon jet. The authors mention that the dataset has dimensions of 177252 × 30 × 4, with 1000 samples used for training.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets. However, it appears that the datasets are either synthetic or derived from specific experimental setups rather than published datasets with formal citations. Therefore, I will document the datasets based on the descriptions provided in the paper.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset names, descriptions, and any relevant details as outlined in the paper. The full citations for the datasets will be noted as they appear in the text, even if they are not formal publications.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for review or further processing, ensuring clarity and completeness in the documentation.
