To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Generative Calibration Clustering" by Haifeng Xia et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for validation. In the introduction, the authors often discuss the context of their work, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets in section 4.1, which is titled "Experimental Setup." Here, they explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments:

1. **Cifar-10**: This dataset consists of 60,000 color images (32×32×3) across 10 classes, with 5,000 training images and 1,000 testing images per class.

2. **Cifar-100**: Similar to Cifar-10, this dataset contains 60,000 images but is divided into 100 fine-grained categories.

3. **STL-10**: This dataset is derived from ImageNet and includes 10 categories, with 500 training samples and 800 test samples for each category, along with 100,000 images from multiple unknown classes.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

- For **Cifar-10** and **Cifar-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky, Geoffrey Hinton, et al. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 2009.

- For **STL-10**, the citation is:
  > Jia Deng, Wei Dong, Richard Socher, Li-Jia Li, Kai Li, and Li Fei-Fei. *Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database*. In 2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 248–255. IEEE, 2009.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets and their respective citations as required.
