To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Adversarial Feature Sampling Learning for Efficient Visual Tracking" by Yingjie Yin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that "extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate" the effectiveness of the proposed method, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention evaluating their method on several benchmark datasets, specifically:

1. **OTB2013**: The authors state that OTB2013 contains 100 fully annotated videos with various tracking challenges. This dataset is crucial for their performance evaluation.

2. **OTB2015**: This dataset is mentioned as a subset of OTB2013, containing 50 fully annotated videos. The authors use it to compare their method against state-of-the-art trackers.

3. **VOT2015**: The paper discusses the VOT2015 benchmark, which includes results from 63 state-of-the-art trackers evaluated on 60 challenging sequences.

4. **VOT2016**: Similar to VOT2015, this dataset contains re-annotated ground truth bounding boxes and is used for further evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **OTB2013**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M. H. (2013). *Online object tracking: A benchmark*. IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.

- For **OTB2015**, the citation is:
  > Wu, Y., Lim, J., & Yang, M. H. (2015). *Object tracking benchmark*. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.

- For **VOT2015**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, M., Pflugfelder, R., Leonardis, A., Matas, J., et al. (2015). *The visual object tracking vot2015 challenge results*. European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops.

- For **VOT2016**, the citation is:
  > Kristan, M., et al. (2016). *The visual object tracking vot2016 challenge results*. European Conference on Computer Vision Workshops.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research.
