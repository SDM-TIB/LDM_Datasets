To extract datasets from the research paper titled "VILT: Video Instructions Linking for Complex Tasks" by Sophie Fischer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the creation of a benchmark with **61 queries from recipe tasks** and a collection of **2,133 instructional "How-To" cooking videos**. This indicates that there are specific datasets related to cooking videos that I need to identify.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methods** or **experiments** sections. In this paper, the authors describe the creation of a "How-To" video corpus, which is a significant dataset. They mention that this corpus was curated from **Common Crawl and YouTube**, containing over **2,000 cooking videos**. This is a key dataset that I need to document.

I will also check the **user study** section, as it may provide additional insights into the datasets used for evaluation. The authors mention that they performed a user study with **10 participants** and evaluated the utility of the videos, but they do not introduce new datasets here.

Now, I will compile the details of the identified datasets. The main dataset I found is:

1. **How-To Cooking Video Corpus**: This dataset consists of **2,140 videos** that describe various cooking methods, curated from wikiHow articles and YouTube. The dataset is significant for the task of linking instructional videos to cooking steps.

Next, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The paper does not provide a specific citation for the "How-To Cooking Video Corpus," but it mentions that the dataset is available at a GitHub repository. I will include this link as part of the dataset description.

The citation for the paper itself is:
> Sophie Fischer, Iain Mackie, Carlos Gemmell, Jeffrey Dalton. *VILT: Video Instructions Linking for Complex Tasks*. In Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), 2022.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

- **Dataset Name**: How-To Cooking Video Corpus
- **Description**: A collection of 2,140 instructional "How-To" cooking videos curated from wikiHow articles and YouTube, designed for linking instructional video content to cooking steps.
- **Citation**: Sophie Fischer, Iain Mackie, Carlos Gemmell, Jeffrey Dalton. *VILT: Video Instructions Linking for Complex Tasks*. In Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), 2022. Available at: https://github.com/grill-lab/VILT

After gathering all this information, I will prepare it for structured output, ensuring that each dataset is clearly defined and properly cited.
