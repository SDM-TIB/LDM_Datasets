To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Correctable Landmark Discovery via Large Models for Vision-Language Navigation" by Bingqian Lin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on multiple popular VLN benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, they mention evaluating their method on four mainstream VLN benchmarks: **R2R**, **REVERIE**, **R4R**, and **RxR**. I will note these names as they are likely the datasets used in their experiments.

To ensure I have the correct details, I will check the **References section** for full citations of these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned in the paper are as follows:

1. **R2R Dataset**: 
   > Anderson, P., Wu, Q., Teney, D., Bruce, J., Johnson, M., Sunderhauf, N., Reid, I., Gould, S., & van den Hengel, A. (2018). *Vision-and-language navigation: Interpreting visually-grounded navigation instructions in real environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2018.

2. **REVERIE Dataset**: 
   > Qi, Y., Wu, Q., Anderson, P., Wang, X., Wang, W. Y., Shen, C., & van den Hengel, A. (2020). *Reverie: Remote embodied visual referring expression in real indoor environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2020.

3. **R4R Dataset**: 
   > Jain, V., Magalhaes, G., Ku, A., Vaswani, A., Ie, E., & Baldridge, J. (2019). *Stay on the path: Instruction fidelity in vision-and-language navigation*. In Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2019.

4. **RxR Dataset**: 
   > Ku, A., Anderson, P., Patel, R., Ie, E., & Baldridge, J. (2020). *Room-across-room: Multilingual vision-and-language navigation with dense spatiotemporal grounding*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their full citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. Each dataset will be clearly labeled with its name and citation to ensure clarity and accuracy in referencing.
