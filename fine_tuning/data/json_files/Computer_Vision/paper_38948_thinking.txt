To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Nonparametric Density Estimation and Convergence of GANs under Besov IPM Losses" by Ananya Uppal et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the research, which might include references to datasets.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or **experiments**. In this paper, I will specifically check sections that discuss the methodology or experimental setup, as they typically detail the datasets used. I will pay attention to any mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and how they were utilized in the experiments.

If the paper does not have a dedicated section for datasets, I will look for mentions in the **results** or **discussion** sections. Authors often refer to datasets when discussing their findings or comparing their results with previous work.

Once I identify the datasets, I will note down their names and any relevant details provided in the paper, such as the number of samples, types of data, and specific characteristics that define each dataset.

After gathering the necessary information, I will consult the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper attribution is essential in academic work. I will ensure that I capture the authors, title, publication venue, and year for each dataset.

Finally, I will compile the extracted information into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset entry includes its name, description, and full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research, ready for further analysis or integration into a database.
