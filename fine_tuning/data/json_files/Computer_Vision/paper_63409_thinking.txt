To extract datasets from the research paper titled "WaveNeRF: Wavelet-based Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields" by Muyu Xu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments over three widely studied benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets in these sections.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they mention training their model using the **DTU dataset**, **IBRNet dataset**, and a real forward-facing dataset from **LLFF**. I will take note of these datasets and look for any additional details provided about them.

In the **experiments subsection**, the authors specify that they followed the approach of PixelNeRF for the partition of the DTU dataset, resulting in 88 training scenes and 16 testing scenes. They also mention using ground truth depths from MVSNet for the DTU dataset. For the LLFF dataset, they used 35 scenes, and for the IBRNet dataset, they used 67 scenes.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution:

1. **DTU Dataset**:
   > Rasmus Jensen, Anders Dahl, George Vogiatzis, Engin Tola, and Henrik Aanæs. *Large scale multi-view stereopsis evaluation*. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 406–413, 2014.

2. **IBRNet Dataset**:
   > Qianqian Wang, Zhicheng Wang, Kyle Genova, Pratul P Srinivasan, Howard Zhou, Jonathan T Barron, Ricardo Martin-Brualla, Noah Snavely, and Thomas Funkhouser. *IBRNet: Learning multi-view image-based rendering*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 4690–4699, 2021.

3. **LLFF Dataset**:
   > Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. *NeRF: Representing scenes as neural radiance fields for view synthesis*. Communications of the ACM, 65(1):99–106, 2021.

After gathering the dataset names and their respective citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset along with its citation. This will ensure that I have accurately captured all necessary details for future reference or processing.
