To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffSal: Joint Audio and Video Learning for Diffusion Saliency Prediction" by Junwen Xiong et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on six challenging audio-visual benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 5 (Experiments)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention six audio-visual datasets:

1. **AVAD**: This dataset consists of 45 video clips with durations ranging from 5 to 10 seconds, covering various audio-visual activities. It includes eye-tracking data from 16 participants.

2. **Coutrot1**: Derived from the Coutrot dataset, this dataset contains 60 video clips across four visual categories, with eye-tracking data from 72 participants.

3. **Coutrot2**: Another subset of the Coutrot dataset, this includes 15 video clips of individuals in a meeting, with eye-tracking data from 40 participants.

4. **DIEM**: This dataset comprises 84 video clips, including game trailers and music videos, captured from 42 participants. The audio and visual tracks do not naturally correspond.

5. **ETMD**: This dataset consists of 12 video clips extracted from various Hollywood movies, with eye-tracking data annotated by 10 different persons.

6. **SumMe**: This dataset includes 25 video clips covering diverse topics such as playing ball, cooking, and traveling.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
