To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Less is More: Lighter and Faster Deep Neural Architecture for Tomato Leaf Disease Classification" by Sabbir Ahmed et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **PlantVillage dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the research.

Next, I will look into the **Materials and Methods** section, specifically the **Dataset** subsection. Here, the authors provide a detailed description of the **PlantVillage dataset**, stating that it contains 54,309 images of healthy and infected leaves across 14 crops, with 18,160 images specifically for tomato leaves divided into one healthy and nine disease classes. This section also discusses the class imbalance present in the dataset, which is important for understanding the context of the research.

I will also check the **References** section to find the full citation for the **PlantVillage dataset**. The relevant citation is:

- **PlantVillage Dataset**: 
  > Hughes, D. P., & Salath√©, M. (2015). An open access repository of images on plant health to enable the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. *arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.08060*.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring to include the dataset name, description, and the full citation as required.

In summary, the key steps I will take are:
1. Read the abstract and introduction for initial mentions of datasets.
2. Review the Materials and Methods section for detailed descriptions of datasets.
3. Locate the full citation in the References section.
4. Compile the dataset information into the required format.

This structured approach will ensure that I accurately extract and cite the dataset used in the research paper.
