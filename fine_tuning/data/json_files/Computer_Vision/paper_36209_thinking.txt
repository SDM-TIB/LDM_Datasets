To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Are You Talking to Me? Reasoned Visual Dialog Generation through Adversarial Learning" by Qi Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the Visual Dialogue task and references the VisDial dataset, which is a strong indication that this dataset is used in the research. I will note this down for further exploration.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, they explicitly mention that they evaluate their method on the **VisDial dataset**. I will gather details about this dataset, including its size and structure, as well as any specific characteristics that the authors highlight.

In the **experiments section**, they describe the VisDial dataset as follows:
- **VisDial Dataset**: This dataset consists of dialogues about images, where each dialogue is formed by pairing two subjects on Amazon Mechanical Turk to chat about an image. The dataset includes 83,000 dialogues in the training split and 40,000 in the validation split, totaling 1,232,870 question-answer pairs.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the VisDial dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> A. Das, S. Kottur, K. Gupta, A. Singh, D. Yadav, J. M. Moura, D. Parikh, and D. Batra. *Visual dialog*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research paper and its full citation. 

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the dataset name, description, and citation for clarity and completeness.
