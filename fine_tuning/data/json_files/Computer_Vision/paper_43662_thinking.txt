To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploration of Interpretability Techniques for Deep COVID-19 Classification Using Chest X-Ray Images" by Soumick Chatterjee et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions the use of **Chest X-Ray images** for classification tasks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used. Here, they explicitly mention two datasets:

1. **COVID-19 Image Data Collection**: This dataset consists of 236 images of COVID-19, along with images of other conditions. The authors provide a link to the dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset**: This dataset contains a total of 1583 images of healthy subjects, 1493 images of viral pneumonia, and 2780 images of bacterial pneumonia. The authors also provide a link to this dataset.

In the **references section**, I will look for the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For the **COVID-19 Image Data Collection**, the citation is:
  > Cohen, J. P., Morrison, P., & Dao, L. (2020). *COVID-19 image data collection*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.11597.

- For the **Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Kermany, D., Zhang, K., & Goldbaum, M. (2018). *Labeled optical coherence tomography (OCT) and chest X-ray images for classification*. Mendeley Data, 2.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
