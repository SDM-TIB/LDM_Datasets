To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIP-NAV: Using CLIP for Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation" by Vishnu Sashank Dorbala et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **REVERIE dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction section** where the authors discuss the challenges of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) and mention the REVERIE dataset explicitly. They describe it as containing human-annotated instructions for paths taken from the Matterport3D environment, which provides context for its use in their experiments.

In the **approach section**, the authors detail how they utilize the REVERIE dataset for their experiments, specifically mentioning the Seen and Unseen validation splits. This confirms that REVERIE is indeed the primary dataset used for evaluation in their work.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the REVERIE dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Qi, Y., Wu, Q., Anderson, P., Wang, X., Yang, W. Y., Shen, C., & van den Hengel, A. (2020). *REVERIE: Remote Embodied Visual Referring Expression in Real Indoor Environments*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pp. 9982â€“9991.

Additionally, the authors mention the **Matterport3D dataset** in the context of the REVERIE dataset, as it provides the environment for the navigation tasks. I will also look for its citation in the references section:
> Chang, A., Dai, A., Funkhouser, T., Halber, M., Niessner, M., Savva, M., Song, S., Zeng, A., & Zhang, Y. (2017). *Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.06158.

Having identified these datasets and their citations, I will compile the information into a structured format for further processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding citations.
