To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Plastic and Stable Exemplar-Free Incremental Learning: A Dual-Learner Framework with Cumulative Parameter Averaging" by Wenju Sun et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to see if any datasets are mentioned. The abstract states that the experimental results are based on **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny-ImageNet**, indicating that these are the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 5) to confirm the datasets used and gather more details about them. In Section 5.1, the authors explicitly mention using **CIFAR-100** and **Tiny-ImageNet** for their experiments. They provide a brief description of each dataset, including the number of classes and samples.

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset consists of 100 classes, with 600 images per class. It is a well-known dataset used for image classification tasks.

2. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset contains 200 classes, with 600 images for each class. It is a smaller version of the ImageNet dataset, designed for image classification tasks.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. University of Toronto, 2012.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Stanford. *Tiny ImageNet Challenge (CS231n)*. 2015. URL http://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

Having gathered this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
