To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SeaDSC: A video-based unsupervised method for dynamic scene change detection in unmanned surface vehicles" by Linh Trinh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a nautical video dataset called **RoboWhaler** for experiments, which indicates that there is at least one dataset to extract.

Next, I will look into **section 4 (Experiment)**, where the authors discuss the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that they created a training dataset by combining images from multiple sources. Specifically, they state:

1. **Singapore Maritime Dataset**: This dataset consists of 3,000 images.
2. **MODD2 Dataset**: This dataset also contains 3,000 images.
3. **Seaships Dataset**: This dataset includes 4,000 images.

The authors clarify that these datasets were used to train their projection model. Additionally, they mention using the **RoboWhaler** dataset for evaluating their system, which consists of 35 videos with a total duration of approximately 66.37 minutes and 47,681 frames.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned:

- For the **Singapore Maritime Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **MODD2 Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **Seaships Dataset**, the citation is:

- For the **RoboWhaler Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
