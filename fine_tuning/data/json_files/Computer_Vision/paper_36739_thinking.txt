To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Pose Knows: Video Forecasting by Generating Pose Futures" by Jacob Walker et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract discusses the use of human pose detectors and mentions the goal of forecasting video events, which suggests that datasets related to human pose estimation or video forecasting may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methodology** and **experiments** sections. In the **experiments section**, the authors mention evaluating their model on the **UCF-101 dataset**. This is a well-known dataset for human action recognition, which is relevant to their work.

I will also check the **related work** section to see if any other datasets are referenced that might have been used for comparison or as part of the methodology. The authors mention the **H3.6M dataset** in the context of pose forecasting, which is another important dataset in this field.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **references section**:

1. **UCF-101 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > K. Soomro, A. R. Zamir, and M. Shah. *UCF101: A dataset of 101 human actions classes from videos in the wild*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1212.0402, 2012.

2. **H3.6M Dataset**: The citation is:
   > C. Ionescu, D. Papava, V. Olaru, and C. Sminchisescu. *Human3.6m: Large scale datasets and predictive methods for 3d human sensing in natural environments*. PAMI, 2014.

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset's name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly attributed in any subsequent analysis or documentation.
