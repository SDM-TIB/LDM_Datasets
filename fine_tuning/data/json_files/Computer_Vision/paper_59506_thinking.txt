To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with Embedding Modulation" by Xi Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experimental evaluations are conducted across multiple datasets, which indicates that several datasets are likely used.

In the **introduction**, the authors refer to traditional segmentation methods and their limitations, hinting at the datasets they might have used for comparison. I will look for specific dataset names mentioned in this section.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any sections explicitly labeled as "Datasets" or similar, as this is where they are most likely to provide detailed information about the datasets.

Upon reviewing the paper, I identify the following datasets mentioned:

1. **COCO (Common Objects in Context)**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of training and evaluating their model. It is a well-known dataset for object detection and segmentation tasks.

2. **ADE20K**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.

3. **Cityscapes**: The authors refer to this dataset when discussing the closed-world ability of their model, indicating it is used for evaluation.

4. **PascalContext**: This dataset is mentioned in the context of evaluating the model's performance across various circumstances.

Now, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For **COCO**, the citation is:
  > Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, James Hays, Pietro Perona, Deva Ramanan, Piotr DollÃ¡r, and C Lawrence Zitnick. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

- For **ADE20K**, the citation is:
  > Bolei Zhou, Hang Zhao, Xavier Puig, Sanja Fidler, Adela Barriuso, and Antonio Torralba. *Scene Parsing through ADE20K Dataset*. In CVPR, 2017.

- For **Cityscapes**, the citation is:
  > Marius Cordts, Mohamed Omran, Sebastian Ramos, Timo Rehfeld, Markus Enzweiler, Rodrigo Benenson, Uwe Franke, Stefan Roth, and Bernt Schiele. *The Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding*. In CVPR, 2016.

- For **PascalContext**, the citation is:
  > J. M. Carreira, A. Zisserman. *Quo Vadis, Action Recognition? A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset*. In CVPR, 2017.

With these citations in hand, I will ensure that each dataset is accurately described and cited in the final output. This structured approach allows me to comprehensively extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
