To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Conditional Diffusion Model with Probability Flow Sampling for Image Super-resolution" by Yutao Yuan and Chun Yuan, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their evaluations. In this paper, the authors mention three datasets: **DIV2K**, **ImageNet**, and **CelebA**. I will note down the context in which these datasets are used, including any specific details about their configurations or modifications for the experiments.

In the **experimental setup**, the authors provide additional information about how they utilized these datasets. For instance, they mention that for DIV2K, models are trained using random HR image crops of size 160 × 160 and evaluated with full-size images. For ImageNet, images are center cropped and resized to 256 × 256 for HR and downsampled to 64 × 64 for LR. CelebA images are cropped and resized to 160 × 160.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access these datasets.

The citations I will extract are:

1. **DIV2K**:
   > Agustsson, E., & Timofte, R. (2017). NTIRE 2017 Challenge on Single Image Super-Resolution: Dataset and Study. In 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPR Workshops 2017, Honolulu, HI, USA, July 21-26, 2017, 1122–1131. IEEE Computer Society.

2. **ImageNet**:
   > Russakovsky, O., Deng, J., Su, H., Krause, J., Satheesh, S., Ma, S., Huang, Z., Karpathy, A., Khosla, A., Bernstein, M. S., Berg, A. C., & Fei-Fei, L. (2015). ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. International Journal of Computer Vision, 115(3), 211–252.

3. **CelebA**:
   > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, 3730–3738.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research and their respective sources.
