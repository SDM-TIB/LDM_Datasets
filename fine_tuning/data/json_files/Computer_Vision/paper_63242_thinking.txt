To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Dynamic Eye-aware Neural Radiance Fields for Human Face" by Hengfei Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments on the **ETH-XGaze dataset**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they selected **ETH-XGaze** for their experiments, describing it as a large-scale gaze estimation dataset collected from 110 subjects with 18 cameras, providing over one million high-resolution images. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their work.

Additionally, in section 4.4, the authors mention using four renowned gaze datasets for enhancing gaze estimation performance: **EyeDiap**, **MPIIFace**, **RT-Gene**, and **Gaze360**. I will need to gather details about these datasets as well.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve full citations for each dataset:

After gathering all the necessary information and citations, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset along with its citation. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their respective references.
