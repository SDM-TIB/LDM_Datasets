To extract datasets from the research paper titled "AligNeRF: High-Fidelity Neural Radiance Fields via Alignment-Aware Training" by Yifan Jiang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on different datasets, which indicates that there are datasets to be identified. I will look for specific names or descriptions of these datasets.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their evaluations. In **Section 4.1 (Dataset)**, the authors explicitly mention that their main testbed consists of outdoor scenes from mip-NeRF 360, which is a significant clue that I need to explore further.

The paper states that mip-NeRF 360 captured five outdoor scenes: **“bicycle,” “flowers,” “treehill,” “garden,” and “stump.”** I will note these names as they are the datasets used for the experiments.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the mip-NeRF 360 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **mip-NeRF 360**, the citation is:
  > Jonathan T Barron, Ben Mildenhall, Dor Verbin, Pratul P Srinivasan, and Peter Hedman. *Mip-nerf 360: Unbounded anti-aliased neural radiance fields*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.12077, 2021.

Since the paper mentions that the captured images were resized to be 4× smaller, I will also note that the original dataset is intended for high-resolution applications.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the names of the datasets along with their full citations. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for further processing or review.
