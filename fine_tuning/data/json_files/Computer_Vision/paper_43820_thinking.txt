To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PCAAE: Principal Component Analysis Autoencoder for Organising the Latent Space of Generative Networks" by Chi-Hieu Pham, SaÃ¯d Ladjal, and Alasdair Newson, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions that the PCAAE is evaluated on the **CelebA dataset**, which is a strong indicator that this dataset is relevant.

Next, I will check the **experiments section** for any additional datasets used in the study. In the results section, the authors discuss their findings using the **CelebA dataset** and also mention synthetic data generated from geometric shapes. This indicates that the CelebA dataset is a primary dataset used for evaluation.

I will then look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The citation is as follows:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). Deep learning face attributes in the wild. In Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).

Additionally, I will note that the paper mentions synthetic datasets created for their experiments, but these do not have a formal citation since they are generated by the authors.

Now, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the CelebA dataset. The final output will clearly list the datasets used in the research, along with their citations, ready for further processing or review.
