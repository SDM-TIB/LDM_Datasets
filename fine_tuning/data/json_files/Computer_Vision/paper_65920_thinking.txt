To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Coop: Memory is not a Commodity" by Jianhao Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and evaluation sections** to look for any references to datasets. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** section, where the authors often discuss the context of their work and may reference datasets that are relevant to their research. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets or benchmarks.

Then, I will examine the **methods** section, particularly any subsections that discuss experimental setups or evaluations. This section is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used for training and testing the proposed method.

After that, I will check the **evaluation** section, where the authors typically present results based on specific datasets. This section may provide insights into the datasets used for performance comparisons.

If the paper includes a **references section**, I will look for full citations of any datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

Now, I will summarize the datasets I find, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset. If the paper mentions specific datasets, I will document them as follows:

1. **Dataset Name**: Description of the dataset, including its purpose, size, and any relevant details.
2. **Full Citation**: The complete reference for the dataset, formatted according to academic standards.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted information into a structured format that clearly presents each dataset and its citation, ensuring that the information is accurate and comprehensive for future reference.
