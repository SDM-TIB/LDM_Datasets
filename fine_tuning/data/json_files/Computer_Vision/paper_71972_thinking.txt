To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Shot Detection of Buildings in Mobile LiDAR Using Language Vision Model" by J. M. Goo et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of synthetic data to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach, which suggests that there may be a dataset involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the challenges of training deep learning models on point cloud datasets and mention the use of synthetic datasets for training. This indicates that there might be specific datasets referenced later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, particularly **section 4.2**, where the authors explicitly mention the **SynthCity dataset**. They describe it as an open-source dataset representing an entire city in the form of a large-scale synthetic point cloud, including 9 sub-areas and 9 label categories. The dataset comprises 367 million labelled points with RGB features, which is crucial information for understanding its scope and utility.

I will also check the **references section** to find the full citation for the SynthCity dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Griffiths, D., Boehm, J. (2019b). *SynthCity: A large scale synthetic point cloud*. http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04758. arXiv:1907.04758 [cs].

Since this is the only dataset explicitly mentioned in the paper, I will compile the information about the SynthCity dataset, including its description and citation.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a clear format, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset extracted from the paper. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset used in the research.
