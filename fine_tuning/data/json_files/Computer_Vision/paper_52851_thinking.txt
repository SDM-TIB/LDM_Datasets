To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Visual Prompts for Adapting Large-Scale Models" by Hyojin Bahng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments across multiple image classification datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they mention a total of **12 datasets**:

1. **CIFAR100**: A dataset containing 50,000 training images across 100 classes.
2. **CIFAR10**: A dataset with 50,000 training images across 10 classes.
3. **Flowers102**: Contains 4,093 images of flowers across 102 categories.
4. **Food101**: Comprises 101 food categories with 50,500 images.
5. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for land use classification with 13,500 images.
6. **SUN397**: Contains 15,888 images across 397 scene categories.
7. **UCF101**: A dataset of 7,639 videos across 101 action categories.
8. **SVHN**: Street View House Numbers dataset with 73,257 images.
9. **OxfordPets**: Contains 2,944 images of cats and dogs.
10. **DTD (Describing Textures in the Wild)**: A dataset with 2,820 images across 47 texture categories.
11. **Resisc45**: A dataset for remote sensing image classification with 18,900 images.
12. **CLEVR**: A diagnostic dataset for compositional language and elementary visual reasoning.

In the same section, the authors also mention that they evaluate robustness to distribution shifts using three additional datasets from WILDS:

- **Camelyon17**
- **FMoW**
- **iWildCAM**

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. Here are the citations I will extract:

For the WILDS datasets, I will also find their citations:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.
