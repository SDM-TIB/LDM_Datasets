To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Tablext: A Combined Neural Network And Heuristic Based Table Extractor" by Zach Colter et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and results sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the performance of Tablext on the **ICDAR 2013 table dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is relevant to the research.

Next, I will check the **experiments and evaluation sections** for any additional datasets used in the study. In the evaluation section, the authors compare Tablext against the **ICDAR 2013 table competition dataset** and a **diverse dataset** containing over 100 tables from various domains. This suggests that both datasets are important for the evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will look into the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **ICDAR 2013 table dataset**, the citation is:
   > M. G¨obel, T. Hassan, E. Oro, and G. Orsi. *ICDAR 2013 Table Competition*. In Proceedings of the 2013 12th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, pages 1449–1453, 2013.

2. For the **diverse dataset** used for comparison, the paper does not provide a specific citation, as it mentions that it was manually procured with over 100 tables from various domains. Therefore, I will note that this dataset does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

- **ICDAR 2013 table dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the performance of Tablext against other state-of-the-art methods.
- **Diverse dataset**: A collection of over 100 tables from various domains, used for comparison with the popular PDF extractor Tabula.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the ICDAR dataset while noting the lack of a formal citation for the diverse dataset.
