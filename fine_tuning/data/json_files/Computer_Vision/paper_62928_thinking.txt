To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SC VALL-E: Style-Controllable Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizer" by DaeGyeom Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract indicates that the authors conducted experiments using various speech synthesis models, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **Datasets section** (Section III.A) where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention that the datasets were collected from the AI Hub, which is a platform operated by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA). They categorize the datasets into five main categories, which include:

1. **Command Speech Dataset**: This dataset is divided into subcategories based on speaker demographics (male/female, infants/children, elderly male/female) and consists of simple sentence utterances spoken by individuals in daily life.

2. **Conversation Speech Dataset**: Similar to the command speech dataset, this dataset is also categorized by demographics and includes conversational speech recorded by individuals.

3. **Emotion and Speaking Style-Specific Speech Dataset**: This dataset consists of recordings by 50 professional voice actors, capturing various emotions and speaking styles.

4. **Korean Speakers' Foreign Language Speech Dataset**: This dataset includes utterances containing foreign words spoken by Korean speakers.

5. **Korean Speech Dataset**: This dataset consists of conversational speech recorded on various topics.

The authors provide a detailed configuration table (Table 1) that outlines the number of speakers, audio clips, total duration, and average duration for each dataset category. This information is crucial for understanding the datasets' scope and scale.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors do not provide specific citations for the datasets themselves, but they reference the AI Hub as the source. Therefore, I will include the citation for the AI Hub as follows:

- **AI Hub**: National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA). "AI Hub." Available: https://aihub.or.kr. Accessed: [insert access date].

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citation for the AI Hub as the source of the datasets. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

After gathering all this information, I will prepare the dataset entries for structured output, ensuring clarity and completeness for future reference or processing.
