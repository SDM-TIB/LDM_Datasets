To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Exploring Self-Attention for Visual Intersection Classification" by Haruki Nakata, Kanji Tanaka, and Koji Takeda, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that experiments were conducted using the **KITTI dataset**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of the dataset in the **experiments section**. In this section, the authors describe how they created a new dataset by extracting images from the **KITTI dataset**. They mention that they manually analyzed GPS information to obtain images corresponding to specific ranges around intersections, indicating that they utilized the KITTI dataset for their experiments.

I will also check the **conclusion and references sections** to ensure that I have the full citation for the KITTI dataset. The authors reference the KITTI dataset in the context of their experiments, confirming its importance.

The full citation for the KITTI dataset, as found in the references, is:
> Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite*. In 2012 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3354â€“3361, 2012.

Now, I will summarize the dataset information:

1. **KITTI Dataset**: This dataset is used for evaluating the proposed intersection classification method. It consists of stereo sequences captured from a sensor-equipped vehicle in an urban environment in Karlsruhe, Germany. The authors created a new dataset by extracting images corresponding to specific intersection passages from the KITTI dataset.

With this information, I will prepare to compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing.
