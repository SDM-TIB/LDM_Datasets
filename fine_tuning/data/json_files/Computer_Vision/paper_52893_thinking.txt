To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SIMBAR: Single Image-Based Scene Relighting For Effective Data Augmentation For Automated Driving Vision Tasks" by Xianling Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions the use of the **KITTI** dataset and **BDD100K** for object detection and tracking experiments, indicating that these datasets are significant for the research.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors describe their experimental setup. In Section 4.1, they explicitly mention the **KITTI tracking dataset**, which consists of 21 sequences of road scenes collected during daytime. They also refer to the **vKITTI** dataset, which is used for testing and contains variations of the KITTI dataset under different lighting conditions.

In Section 4.2, the authors provide quantitative results for models trained on the original KITTI dataset and those augmented with relit images from both **MVR-I** and **SIMBAR**. This reinforces the importance of the KITTI dataset in their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention the **DIV2K** dataset in the context of relighting experiments, indicating that it is used for generating relit images. 

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper from the **References section**:

After identifying the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured format that highlights each dataset's name, description, and citation. This will ensure that the information is clear and accessible for further use or analysis.
