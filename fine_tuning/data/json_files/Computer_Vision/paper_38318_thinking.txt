To extract datasets from the research paper titled "BAN: Focusing on Boundary Context for Object Detection" by Yonghyun Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions evaluating the proposed method on **PASCAL VOC detection benchmark** and **MS COCO dataset**, indicating that these are the datasets used for their experiments.

Next, I will look for specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section (Section 4)**. Here, the authors confirm that they conducted experiments on both the **PASCAL VOC** and **MS COCO** datasets. They provide performance metrics, such as mean Average Precision (mAP), which further emphasizes the importance of these datasets in their evaluation.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to guide readers to the original sources of the datasets.

1. For the **PASCAL VOC dataset**, the citation is:
   > Everingham, M., Van Gool, L., Williams, C.K., Winn, J., Zisserman, A. (2010). *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) Challenge*. International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

2. For the **MS COCO dataset**, the citation is:
   > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Doll√°r, P., Zitnick, C.L. (2014). *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

Having gathered the necessary information, I will now compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described accurately and includes the full citation. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
