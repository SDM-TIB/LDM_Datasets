To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Data-Driven Traffic Reconstruction and Kernel Methods for Identifying Stop-and-Go Congestion" by Edgar Ramirez Sanchez et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets that are mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the use of traffic reconstruction techniques for identifying stop-and-go events, which suggests that there may be datasets involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) dataset as a key data source. This dataset is described as containing traffic flow, occupancy, and speed data from induction loop detectors across California highways. This is a significant dataset for the study.

Next, I will look for more details in the **methodology section**. Here, the authors elaborate on how they utilize the PeMS dataset, stating that it consists of roughly 39,000 induction loop detectors capturing data every 30 seconds. This confirms the dataset's relevance and importance for their analysis.

I will also check the **experiments section** to see if any additional datasets are mentioned. However, the focus remains on the PeMS dataset, which is used as the ground truth for their traffic reconstruction framework.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) dataset. The citation is typically not provided in the same way as academic papers, but I can reference the official source or documentation for PeMS.

The citation for the PeMS dataset is:
> California Department of Transportation. *Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS)*. Available at: https://pems.dot.ca.gov/

Since this is the primary dataset used in the research, I will create an entry for it.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This will ensure that the dataset is properly documented for future reference or analysis.
