To extract datasets from the research paper titled "IPC-Net: 3D point-cloud segmentation using deep inter-point convolutional layers" by Felipe Gomez Marulanda et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research focus, and the introduction often highlights the datasets used for evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the need for better segmentation algorithms in 3D spaces and mention the use of point-cloud representations. However, I need to look for specific dataset names.

Next, I will focus on **section 6 (Experiments & Results)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and testing their models. Here, they mention that their model was trained on the segment-annotated family of the **ShapeNet dataset**. They specify that this dataset comes in two versions: the original ShapeNet dataset and the annotated-ShapeNet dataset, which contains labeled point-cloud representations.

The authors provide details about the **annotated-ShapeNet dataset**, stating it contains 16,881 shapes from 16 different categories, and they specifically selected the Aircraft category for kernel analysis. They also mention the partitioning of the dataset into training and test sets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for the datasets mentioned in the **References section**:

1. **ShapeNet dataset**:
   > Angel X Chang, Thomas Funkhouser, Leonidas Guibas, Pat Hanrahan, Qixing Huang, Zimo Li, Silvio Savarese, Manolis Savva, Shuran Song, Hao Su, et al. *ShapeNet: An information-rich 3D model repository*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.03012, 2015.

2. **Annotated-ShapeNet dataset**:
   > Li Yi, Vladimir G Kim, Duygu Ceylan, I Shen, Mengyan Yan, Hao Su, Cewu Lu, Qixing Huang, Alla Sheffer, Leonidas Guibas, et al. *A scalable active framework for region annotation in 3D shape collections*. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), 35(6):210, 2016.

With this information, I can now summarize the datasets extracted from the paper, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research.
