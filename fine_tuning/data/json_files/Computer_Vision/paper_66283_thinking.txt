To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Controllable Text Summarization: Unraveling Challenges, Approaches, and Prospects - A Survey" by Ashok Urlana et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and datasets sections** of the paper to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, while the introduction discusses the need for controllable summarization and hints at various datasets used in the field.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Datasets)**, which is specifically dedicated to datasets. This section outlines various datasets used in controllable text summarization research. I will carefully note the names of the datasets, their descriptions, and any relevant details provided by the authors.

In this section, the authors mention several datasets, including:

1. **CNN-DailyMail**: A widely used dataset for news summarization, consisting of articles and their corresponding summaries. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Nallapati, R., Zhai, F., & Zhou, B. (2016). *Abstractive text summarization using sequence-to-sequence RNNs and beyond*. In Proceedings of the 20th SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2016), pages 280-290.

2. **DUC (Document Understanding Conference)**: Another popular dataset for summarization tasks. The citation is:
   > Dang, H. T. (2005). *Overview of DUC 2005*. In Proceedings of the Document Understanding Conference (DUC 2005).

3. **Gigaword**: A large-scale dataset for summarization, which includes news articles. The citation is:
   > Napoles, C., Gormley, M. R., & Van Durme, B. (2012). *Annotated Gigaword*. In Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Automatic Knowledge Base Construction and Web-Scale Knowledge Extraction (AKBC-WEKEX 2012), pages 95-100.

4. **XSum**: A dataset designed for extreme summarization, where each article is paired with a single-sentence summary. The citation is:
   > Narayan, S., Cohen, S. B., & Lapata, M. (2018). *Donâ€™t give me the details, just the summary! Topic-aware convolutional neural networks for extreme summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2018 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2018), pages 1797-1807.

5. **NYTimes**: A dataset containing articles from The New York Times, used for various summarization tasks. The citation is:
   > Sandhaus, E. (2008). *The New York Times Annotated Corpus*. Linguistic Data Consortium, Philadelphia.

6. **SAMSUM**: A dialogue-based summarization dataset. The citation is:
   > Gliwa, B., Mochol, I., Biesek, M., & Wawer, A. (2019). *SAMSUM corpus: A human-annotated dialogue dataset for abstractive summarization*. In Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization, pages 70-79.

7. **ASPECTNEWS**: A dataset for aspect-oriented summarization. The citation is:
   > Ahuja, O., Xu, J., Gupta, A., Horecka, K., & Durrett, G. (2022). *ASPECTNEWS: Aspect-oriented summarization of news documents*. In Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2022), pages 6494-6506.

After identifying these datasets and their citations, I will compile them into a structured format for further use.

This systematic approach ensures that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately, which is crucial for any downstream tasks or analyses.
