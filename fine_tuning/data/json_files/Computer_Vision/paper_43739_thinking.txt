To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Review of Automated Diagnosis of COVID-19 Based on Scanning Images" by Delong Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the use of X-ray and CT images for diagnosing COVID-19, which suggests that there may be datasets related to these imaging modalities.

Next, I will examine the **methods and results sections** to look for any specific datasets that the authors reference. In the introduction, the authors mention reviewing 70 models proposed between February 14, 2020, and July 21, 2020, which implies that these models likely utilized various datasets for training and evaluation.

I will then focus on the **evaluation section**, where the authors summarize the performance of the models and may provide details about the datasets used, including their sizes and characteristics. The table summarizing dataset sizes and performance metrics will be particularly useful for identifying specific datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide context for the datasets used in the models discussed in the paper.

From my reading, I will likely identify datasets such as:

1. **COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset**: This dataset is often referenced in studies for training models to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. I will need to find the specific citation for this dataset.

2. **COVID-19 CT Scan Dataset**: Similar to the X-ray dataset, this dataset is used for training models that analyze CT scans for COVID-19 detection. I will also look for its citation.

3. **Other datasets**: The paper may reference additional datasets used in the reviewed models, which I will need to document.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation as found in the references section.

Finally, I will organize this information clearly to facilitate further processing or review, ensuring that all datasets are accurately represented with their respective citations.
