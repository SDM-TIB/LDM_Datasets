To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Marine vessel tracking using a monocular camera" by Tobias Jacob et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, results, and references sections** to locate any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, and I will look for any indications of datasets used for training or evaluation.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the context and applications of their research, which may include references to datasets. I will pay attention to any specific mentions of datasets or data sources that are relevant to their methodology.

Next, I will focus on the **methods section**, particularly where the authors describe their data collection process. They mention that the data consists of videos and GPS positions of the vessels. I will look for details about the specific dataset used, including the number of videos, their duration, and any ground truth data provided.

In the **results section**, the authors validate their methods using a specific dataset, which is referred to as the "AI tracks at sea" Challenge dataset. I will note the details provided about this dataset, including the number of videos and any relevant characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will consult the **references section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The specific dataset I will extract is:

1. **AI tracks at sea Challenge Dataset**: This dataset contains 11 videos, each 3 minutes long, along with ground truth GPS positions for the ship.

Now, I will look for the full citation for this dataset. The authors reference the challenge as follows:
> Tall, M. H. (2020). AI tracks at sea. Retrieved from https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/AI-tracks-at-sea/

With this information, I will compile the dataset entry, ensuring that I include the full citation as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entry for structured output, ensuring that all necessary details are included for clarity and completeness.
