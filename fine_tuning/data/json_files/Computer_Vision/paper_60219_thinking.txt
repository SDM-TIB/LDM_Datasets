To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Deep Stable Multi-Interest Learning for Out-of-distribution Sequential Recommendation" by Qiang Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that extensive experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets, which indicates that datasets are indeed present.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5), where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **Book Dataset**: This dataset is part of the Amazon Product Data in the "book" category, containing 603,668 users, 367,982 items, and 8,898,041 user behaviors.

2. **Movies and TV Dataset**: This dataset is part of the updated version of Amazon Review Data, with 304,763 users, 89,590 items, and 3,506,470 user behaviors.

3. **CDs and Vinyl Dataset**: This dataset is also part of the updated Amazon Review Data, consisting of 129,237 users, 145,522 items, and 1,682,049 user behaviors.

To confirm the details and obtain full citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. However, since the datasets are derived from publicly available sources (Amazon Product Data and Amazon Review Data), I will cite them accordingly:

- For the **Book Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. McAuley, C. Targett, Q. Shi, and A. Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In Proceedings of the International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 2015, pp. 43–52.

- For the **Movies and TV Dataset**, the citation is:
  > R. He and J. McAuley. *Ups and downs: Modeling the visual evolution of fashion trends with one-class collaborative filtering*. In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference, 2016, pp. 507–517.

- For the **CDs and Vinyl Dataset**, the citation is:
  > J. Ni, J. Li, and J. McAuley. *Justifying recommendations using distantly-labeled reviews and fine-grained aspects*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, 2019, pp. 188–197.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This ensures that I have accurately captured the datasets along with their full citations as required.
