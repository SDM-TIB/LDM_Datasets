To extract datasets from the research paper titled "PaccMann: Prediction of anticancer compound sensitivity with multi-modal attention-based neural networks" by Ali Oskooei et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract mentions a novel approach for predicting anticancer compound sensitivity, which suggests that datasets related to drug sensitivity and gene expression may be involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Methods)**, where the authors describe the data used in their study. They explicitly mention using the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** database, which is a key dataset for their research. I will look for specific details about this dataset, such as its contents and the number of samples.

In this section, the authors state that the GDSC dataset includes results from screening over a thousand genetically profiled human pan-cancer cell lines with a wide range of anticancer compounds. They also mention that they based their models on gene expression data, which is crucial for their analysis.

I will also note that they collected molecular structures for 208 compounds from the GDSC database and used a data augmentation strategy to represent each compound with 32 SMILES strings, resulting in a dataset of 6,556,160 drug-cell pairs. This is an important detail that quantifies the dataset's size and composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the GDSC dataset. The relevant citation is:

- **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)**:

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear format, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
