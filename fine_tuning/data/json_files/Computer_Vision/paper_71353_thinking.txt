To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MoDiTalker: Motion-Disentangled Diffusion Model for High-Fidelity Talking Head Generation" by Seyeon Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on standard benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned in these sections.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (section 5) closely, as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In this section, the authors explicitly mention using the **LRS3-TED** and **HDTF** datasets for their models. I will note down the details provided about these datasets, such as their content and purpose.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a brief description of each dataset:
1. **LRS3-TED**: This dataset comprises 400 hours of TED talk videos, which serves as a large lip-reading corpus. It is used for training the Audio-to-Motion (AToM) model.
2. **HDTF**: This dataset is used for training the Motion-to-Video (MToV) model and consists of high-quality videos. The authors mention that they randomly selected 312 videos from this dataset for training and used the remaining 98 for testing.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:
- For **LRS3-TED**:
  > Afouras, T., Chung, J.S., Zisserman, A. (2018). *LRS3-TED: A large-scale dataset for visual speech recognition*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.00496.

- For **HDTF**:
  > Zhang, Z., Li, L., Ding, Y., Fan, C. (2021). *Flow-guided one-shot talking face generation with a high-resolution audio-visual dataset*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 3661â€“3670.

Now that I have gathered the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, description, and full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research.
