To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Graph Convolutional Neural Networks based on Quantum Vertex Saliency" by Lu Bai et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the proposed model is evaluated on "benchmark graph classification datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation in the **Experiments** section. They mention nine standard graph datasets from bioinformatics and social networks, which are crucial for understanding the performance of their proposed model.

The datasets mentioned are:

1. **MUTAG**: A dataset containing chemical compounds, specifically for mutagenicity prediction.
2. **NCI1**: A dataset used for chemical compound classification.
3. **PROTEINS**: A dataset for protein classification based on their structure.
4. **D&D**: Another dataset related to chemical compounds.
5. **PTC (MR)**: A dataset for predicting the mutagenicity of chemical compounds.
6. **COLLAB**: A dataset from social networks.
7. **IMDB-B**: A dataset for social network analysis.
8. **IMDB-M**: Another dataset related to social networks.
9. **RED-B**: A dataset from social networks.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations for the datasets are typically included in the references, and I will ensure to extract them accurately.

For example, the citation for the **MUTAG** dataset is:
> Debnath, A. K., Lopez de Compadre, R. L., Debnath, G., Shusterman, A. J., & Hansch, C. (1991). Structure-activity relationship of mutagenic aromatic and heteroaromatic nitro compounds. *Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*, 34(2), 786-797.

I will repeat this process for each dataset, ensuring that I capture the correct citation format as presented in the references.

Finally, I will compile all the extracted datasets along with their full citations into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further. This will ensure that I have a comprehensive and accurate representation of the datasets used in the research paper.
