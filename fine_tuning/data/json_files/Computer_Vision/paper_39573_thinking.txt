To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards computer vision powered color-nutrient assessment of puréed food" by Kaylen J. Pfisterer et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** to identify any mentions of datasets or data sources. The abstract discusses a novel approach to modeling the link between color and vitamin A content using transmittance imaging, which suggests that there may be datasets related to food samples.

Next, I will examine the **methods section** closely, as it often contains detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the experiments. In this case, the authors mention a "five-tier dilution series" of commercially-prepared puréed foods containing vitamin A, specifically naming **butternut squash, carrot, mango, and sweet potato**. This indicates that these foods are part of the dataset.

I will also look for any specific dataset names or references to publicly available datasets. In this paper, the authors do not explicitly name a dataset but describe the data acquisition process and the types of samples used. Therefore, I will note the types of samples and their characteristics as part of the dataset description.

In the **results section**, the authors present findings related to the accuracy of their deep autoencoder network, which is based on the data collected from the puréed food samples. This reinforces the importance of the dataset used for training and evaluation.

Finally, I will check the **references section** for any citations related to the datasets or methodologies used. The authors reference their previous work, which may provide additional context or datasets used in their studies.

Based on my findings, I will summarize the datasets as follows:

1. **Dataset of Puréed Foods**: This dataset includes samples of butternut squash, carrot, mango, and sweet potato, specifically prepared in a five-tier dilution series for the purpose of assessing vitamin A content through transmittance imaging.

Since there are no specific dataset citations provided in the paper, I will note that the dataset is derived from the authors' experimental setup and does not have a formal citation. However, I will include the citation for the paper itself, as it describes the dataset and methodology in detail.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Kaylen J. Pfisterer, Robert Amelard, Braeden Syrnyk, and Alexander Wong. *Towards computer vision powered color-nutrient assessment of puréed food*. Journal of Food Engineering, 223:220–235, 2018.

Now, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
