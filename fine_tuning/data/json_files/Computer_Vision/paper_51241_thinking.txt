To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Stochastic Control Approach to Bid-Ask Price Modelling" by Engel John C. Dela Vega and Robert J. Elliott, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the study, but it may not contain specific dataset information. The introduction often outlines the context and may reference datasets used in previous studies or those that the current study builds upon.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **methodology or experiments sections**. If the authors describe their approach to modeling bid and ask prices, they might reference specific datasets used for validation or testing their model.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any references to empirical data or datasets that inform the stochastic control model. If the authors mention using historical market data, I will note the specifics, such as the source of the data, the time period covered, and any relevant characteristics of the dataset.

After identifying any datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure to capture the complete citation format as it appears in the paper.

For example, if the authors reference a dataset like "Historical Stock Prices from Yahoo Finance," I will look for the original source or publication that describes this dataset in detail, including authors, title, publication year, and any relevant DOI or URL.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information about the datasets, I will compile the findings into a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described and properly cited.

In summary, my steps will be:
1. Read the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections for mentions of datasets.
2. Look for a dedicated section on datasets or references to datasets in the methodology or experiments.
3. Note any specific datasets mentioned, including their characteristics and sources.
4. Check the References section for full citations of the datasets.
5. Compile the information into a structured format for clarity and accessibility.
