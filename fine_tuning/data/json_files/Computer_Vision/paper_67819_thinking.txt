To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unbiasing Enhanced Sampling on a High-dimensional Free Energy Surface with Deep Generative Model" by Yikai Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are mentioned or referenced. The abstract discusses the use of a score-based diffusion model for unbiasing enhanced sampling simulations, which suggests that there may be datasets related to molecular dynamics simulations.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **methods** and **experiments** sections. In these sections, the authors typically describe the systems they tested their methods on. I will pay close attention to any specific names of datasets or systems that are used in their experiments.

Upon reviewing the paper, I find that the authors conducted experiments on three systems: 

1. **Alanine Dipeptide**: The paper mentions that they performed TAMD simulations on alanine dipeptide, which is a well-known benchmark system in molecular dynamics studies.

2. **Glutamine Dipeptide**: Similarly, the authors also tested their method on glutamine dipeptide, another common system used in molecular dynamics.

3. **Met-enkephalin**: The final system mentioned is met-enkephalin, which is a polypeptide commonly used in enhanced sampling techniques.

Now, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets related to these systems are as follows:

- For **Alanine Dipeptide**, the citation is:
  > Smith, P. E. The alanine dipeptide free energy surface in solution. *The Journal of Chemical Physics*, 1999, 111, 5568–5579.

- For **Glutamine Dipeptide**, the citation is:
  > Hénin, J.; Fiorin, G.; Chipot, C.; Klein, M. L. Exploring Multidimensional Free Energy Landscapes Using Time-Dependent Biases on Collective Variables. *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation*, 2010, 6, 35–47.

- For **Met-enkephalin**, the citation is:
  > Sutto, L.; D’Abramo, M.; Gervasio, F. L. Comparing the efficiency of biased and unbiased molecular dynamics in reconstructing the free energy landscape of met-enkephalin. *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation*, 2010, 6, 3640–3646.

After gathering this information, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I have accurately captured the relevant details for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This will allow for a comprehensive understanding of the datasets used in the research and their significance in the context of the study.
