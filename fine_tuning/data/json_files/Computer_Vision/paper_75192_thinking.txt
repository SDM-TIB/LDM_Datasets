To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Depression Detection and Analysis using Large Language Models on Textual and Audio-Visual Modalities" by Avinash Anand et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the experiments were performed on the **Extended Distress Analysis Interview Corpus Wizard of Oz dataset (E-DAIC)**, which is a strong indication that this dataset is central to the research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in the **dataset section (III)**. Here, the authors describe the E-DAIC dataset in detail, noting that it includes 275 interviews conducted by an animated virtual interviewer and an AI-based agent. They also mention the structure of the dataset, including training, validation, and test sets, as well as the types of files included (audio, transcripts, visual features, etc.).

I will also check the **literature review and evaluation metrics sections** to see if any other datasets are referenced or used in comparison. The authors mention the **Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC)** and its use in previous AVEC challenges, which suggests that it is relevant to their work.

Now, I will compile the full citations for the datasets mentioned:

1. **E-DAIC Dataset**: The citation for this dataset is not explicitly provided in the paper, but it is an extension of the DAIC-WOZ dataset. I will reference the original DAIC paper:
   > Gratch, J., et al. "The Distress Analysis Interview Corpus of human and computer interviews." 

2. **DAIC Dataset**: The citation for the original DAIC dataset is:
   > DeVault, D., et al. "SimSensei kiosk: a virtual human interviewer for healthcare decision support." In Proceedings of the 2014 international conference on Autonomous agents and multi-agent systems, 2014, pp. 1061â€“1068.

After gathering this information, I will ensure that I have accurately captured the details of the datasets, including their names, descriptions, and citations, to facilitate further analysis or use in future research.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured format, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation for easy reference.
