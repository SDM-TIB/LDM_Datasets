To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Aware Score Distillation via 3D Consistent Noising and Gradient Consistency Modeling" by Min-Seop Kwak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention any datasets used. The introduction often elaborates on the context and significance of the datasets, while the methodology and experiments sections typically detail the datasets employed in the research.

In the **introduction**, I will look for any references to datasets that are crucial for the experiments or methodologies discussed. If the authors mention any specific datasets or benchmarks, I will note them down.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. This section usually contains explicit mentions of datasets used for training, validation, or testing. I will look for any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets or data collection, as these will provide detailed descriptions of the datasets, including their sizes, types, and any specific characteristics.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For example, if the paper mentions a dataset like "Objaverse," I will look for its citation in the references. The citation format typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is described with its name, a brief description, and the full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.

Finally, I will ensure that the dataset descriptions are clear and concise, making it easy for readers to understand the relevance and application of each dataset in the context of the research presented in the paper.
