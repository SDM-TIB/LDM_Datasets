To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Geometry-Complete Diffusion for 3D Molecule Generation and Optimization" by Alex Morehead and Jianlin Cheng, I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors evaluate their method on the **QM9 dataset** and the **GEOM-Drugs dataset**, which suggests these are key datasets used in their research.

Next, I will examine the **introduction** section for further details about these datasets. The introduction mentions that the Geometry-Complete Diffusion Model (GCDM) achieves state-of-the-art results on both the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets, confirming their significance in the study.

I will then look at the **results** section, specifically subsections 2.1 and 2.3, where the authors provide detailed descriptions of the datasets used:

1. **QM9 Dataset**: This dataset contains molecular properties and 3D atom coordinates for 130,000 small molecules, with each molecule containing up to 29 atoms. The authors mention that they split the dataset into training, validation, and test partitions consisting of 100,000, 18,000, and 13,000 molecule examples, respectively.

2. **GEOM-Drugs Dataset**: This dataset is described as containing 430,000 molecules, each with an average of 44 atoms and up to 181 atoms. The authors note that they collect the 30 lowest-energy conformers for each molecule for their experiments.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **QM9 dataset**, the citation is:
  > Ramakrishnan, R., Dral, P.O., Rupp, M., & Von Lilienfeld, O.A. (2014). *Quantum chemistry structures and properties of 134 kilo molecules*. Scientific Data, 1(1), 1-7.

- For the **GEOM-Drugs dataset**, the citation is not explicitly provided in the text, so I will need to look for it in the references. The authors refer to several works that may include the dataset, but I will need to ensure I find the correct source that describes the GEOM-Drugs dataset.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for both datasets as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
