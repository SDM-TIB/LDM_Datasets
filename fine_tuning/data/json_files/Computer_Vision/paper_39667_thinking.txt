To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Ink Removal from Histopathology Whole Slide Images by Combining Classification, Detection and Image Generation Models" by Sharib Ali et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the challenges of ink contamination in histopathology images, but it does not specify any datasets directly. 

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** where the authors elaborate on the problem of ink contamination in digitized slides. They mention the need for a method to remove these markings but do not provide specific dataset names.

In the **methods section**, particularly in subsection 3 (Experiments), the authors describe the use of **eight Formalin-Fixed ParafÔ¨Ån-Embedded (FFPE) H&E stained prostate slides** for their study. This indicates that they have a dataset of whole slide images, but I need to gather more details about it.

The authors mention that these slides were scanned at a resolution of 40X and included ink marks in four different colors. However, they do not provide a specific name for this dataset. I will note that the dataset consists of high-resolution images generated from these slides.

In the **experiments section**, they also mention using **image tiles** generated from these whole slide images for their ink removal experiments. The average size of each whole slide image is around 4.5 GB, but again, no formal dataset name is provided.

Finally, I will check the **references section** to see if any of the cited works correspond to datasets. However, the references primarily cite methods and techniques rather than datasets.

Since the paper does not provide formal names or citations for the datasets used, I will summarize the dataset information as follows:

1. **Dataset of Whole Slide Images**: This dataset consists of eight FFPE H&E stained prostate slides used for ink removal experiments. The slides contain ink marks in various colors and were scanned at a high resolution.

2. **Image Tiles**: The authors generated image tiles from the whole slide images for their experiments, but again, no specific dataset name is provided.

Since there are no formal citations for these datasets in the paper, I will note that the dataset is based on the authors' own collection of histopathology slides, and I will not be able to provide full citations as there are no external references for these datasets.

In conclusion, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format, noting the lack of formal dataset names and citations, while emphasizing the nature of the data used in the study.
