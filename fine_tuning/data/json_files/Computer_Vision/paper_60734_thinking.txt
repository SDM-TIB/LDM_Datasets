To extract datasets from the research paper titled "APR: Online Distant Point Cloud Registration through Aggregated Point Cloud Reconstruction" by Quan Liu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on the **KITTI** and **nuScenes** datasets, which indicates that these datasets are likely important for the research.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **datasets section** in the paper, which is often where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. In this case, I find that the authors mention creating two new datasets: **LoKITTI** and **LoNuScenes**, derived from the original KITTI and nuScenes datasets. This is a crucial detail, as it indicates that these datasets are specifically tailored for their research on distant point cloud registration.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide further details about how they utilized these datasets. They explain that LoKITTI and LoNuScenes were created by selecting point cloud pairs with â‰¤ 30% overlap from the original datasets, which is essential information for understanding the context of these datasets.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. I will refer to the **References section** to find the original sources for the KITTI and nuScenes datasets, as well as any relevant citations for LoKITTI and LoNuScenes.

1. **KITTI Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Andreas Geiger, Philip Lenz, and Raquel Urtasun. *Are we ready for autonomous driving? The KITTI vision benchmark suite*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2012.

2. **nuScenes Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous driving*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, June 2020.

3. **LoKITTI Dataset**: Since LoKITTI is derived from the KITTI dataset, I will reference the KITTI citation above. The authors do not provide a separate citation for LoKITTI, as it is a new dataset created for their specific research.

4. **LoNuScenes Dataset**: Similarly, LoNuScenes is derived from the nuScenes dataset, so I will reference the nuScenes citation above. There is no separate citation for LoNuScenes in the paper.

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This structured approach allows me to systematically extract and document the datasets used in the research paper.
