To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Pixel-wise Energy-biased Abstention Learning for Anomaly Segmentation on Complex Urban Driving Scenes" by Yu Tian et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention key datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, which is likely to contain detailed information about the datasets used in the study. In this section, the authors typically describe the datasets, including their characteristics and the context in which they were used.

Upon reviewing section 4.1 (Datasets), I find the following datasets mentioned:

1. **LostAndFound Dataset**: This dataset is described as one of the first publicly available urban driving scene anomaly detection datasets, containing 1,203 images with small obstacles collected from 13 different street scenes. It features 37 different types of anomalous objects.

2. **Fishyscapes Dataset**: This is a high-resolution dataset for anomaly estimation in semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes. It includes two data sources: Fishyscapes LostAndFound and Fishyscapes Static. The validation set consists of 100 images from the LostAndFound dataset and 30 images with blended anomalous objects from Pascal VOC.

3. **Road Anomaly Dataset**: This dataset contains 60 images from the Internet, featuring unexpected animals, rocks, cones, and obstacles. It presents a challenge due to the diverse scales and sizes of the abnormal objects.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

- For the **Fishyscapes Dataset**, the citation is:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that I have accurately captured the necessary details for each dataset mentioned in the paper.
