To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Optimizing Diffusion Noise Can Serve As Universal Motion Priors" by Korrawe Karunratanakul et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets that are referenced. The abstract mentions that the authors demonstrate their method on various motion-related tasks, which suggests that datasets may be involved.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section**. In this paper, the authors explicitly state that they evaluate their method on the **HumanML3D dataset**, which contains 44,970 motion annotations of 14,646 motion sequences from the **AMASS** and **HumanAct12** datasets. This is a clear indication that these datasets are used in their experiments.

I will then check the **references section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

1. **HumanML3D Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, Shihao Zou, Qingyao Sun, Annan Deng, Minglun Gong, and Li Cheng. *Generating diverse and natural 3D human motions from text*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 5152–5161, 2022.

2. **AMASS Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Naureen Mahmood, Nima Ghorbani, Nikolaus F Troje, Gerard Pons-Moll, and Michael J Black. *Amass: Archive of motion capture as surface shapes*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pages 5442–5451, 2019.

3. **HumanAct12 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Chuan Guo, Xinxin Zuo, Sen Wang, and Li Cheng. *Action2motion: Conditioned generation of 3D human motions*. In Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia, pages 2021–2029, 2020.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and that the full citations are included. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper, ready for further processing or review.
