To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The Variational InfoMax AutoEncoder" by Vincenzo Crescimanna and Bruce Graham, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions, but it may not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will focus on the introduction and experiments sections for detailed information.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and its limitations, but they do not mention any datasets directly. I will proceed to the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their computational experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors mention that they evaluated their model on four datasets: **MNIST**, **CIFAR10**, **Omniglot**, and **CelebA**. Each dataset is used for different purposes, such as evaluating generative and inference models. The paper provides some context about these datasets, including their characteristics and the number of samples.

Next, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

1. **MNIST Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. *The MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits*. 1998. [Online]. Available: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

2. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Alex Krizhevsky and Geoffrey Hinton. *Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images*. 2009. [Online]. Available: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

3. **Omniglot Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Brenden Lake, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, and Joshua Tenenbaum. *Human-Level Concept Learning through Probabilistic Program Induction*. Science, 350(6266):1332-1338, 2015. [Online]. Available: https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot

4. **CelebA Dataset**: The citation is:
   > Ziwei Liu, Ping Luo, Xiaogang Wang, and Xiaoou Tang. *Deep Learning Face Attributes in the Wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015, pp. 3730â€“3738. [Online]. Available: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This ensures that all datasets are properly attributed and accessible for future reference.
