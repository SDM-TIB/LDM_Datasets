To extract the datasets mentioned in the research paper titled "Semantic Lens: Instance-Centric Semantic Alignment for Video Super-Resolution" by Qi Tang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often outlines the context and significance of the work. In this case, the introduction mentions the use of the **YouTube-VIS dataset** for evaluating the proposed method, which indicates that this dataset is crucial for the experiments.

Next, I will look at the **experiments section**, specifically the part where the authors discuss the datasets used for evaluation. In this paper, the authors explicitly mention the **YouTube-VIS** dataset and its different versions (2019, 2021, and 2022). They provide details about the number of video clips and instances in each version, which is essential for understanding the dataset's scope.

In the **experiments section**, the authors describe the datasets as follows:

1. **YouTube-VIS 2019**: This version consists of 2,238 high-resolution video clips for training and 302 for validation, with a total of 4,883 unique video instances.

2. **YouTube-VIS 2021**: This version includes 2,985 videos, with additional validation videos that nearly double the annotation quantity compared to its predecessor.

3. **YouTube-VIS 2022**: This version introduces 71 more complex and longer videos into the validation set, building upon the 2021 version.

Now, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for the YouTube-VIS dataset. The citations for the dataset versions are as follows:

- For **YouTube-VIS 2019**, the citation is:
  > Yang, L., Fan, Y., and Xu, N. (2019). Video Instance Segmentation. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5187â€“5196.

- For **YouTube-VIS 2021**, the citation is:
  > Yang, L., Fan, Y., and Xu, N. (2021). The 3rd Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge - video instance segmentation track. Available at: https://youtube-vos.org/dataset/vis/.

- For **YouTube-VIS 2022**, the citation is:
  > Yang, L., Fan, Y., and Xu, N. (2022). The 4th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge - video instance segmentation track. Available at: https://youtube-vos.org/challenge/2022/.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes its full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details regarding the datasets used in the research paper.
