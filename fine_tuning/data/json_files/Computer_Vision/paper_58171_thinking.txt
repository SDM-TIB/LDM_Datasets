To extract datasets from the research paper titled "CLIPTER: Looking at the Bigger Picture in Scene Text Recognition" by Aviad Aberdam et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. In the abstract, the authors mention that their method is validated on "twelve highly-diverse datasets." This indicates that multiple datasets are involved, prompting me to look for specific names and details.

Next, I will navigate to the **experiments section** (Section 4), where the authors provide a detailed account of the datasets used. Here, they explicitly list the datasets and provide some context about each one. I will carefully note the names and any relevant details provided for each dataset.

The datasets mentioned in the paper are:

1. **ICDAR 2013**: A dataset used for robust reading competition, which includes various scene text images.
2. **ICDAR 2015**: Another dataset for robust reading, focusing on incidental scene text.
3. **ArT**: A dataset of arbitrary-shaped text collected from various sources.
4. **SVT**: A dataset containing street view text images.
5. **LSVT**: A dataset that includes scene text in street view images.
6. **COCO-Text**: A dataset based on the COCO dataset, containing text in natural images.
7. **RCTW**: A dataset for reading Chinese text in images.
8. **Uber**: A dataset collected from street-level images.
9. **ReCTS**: A dataset containing Chinese text on signboards.
10. **MLT19**: A multilingual dataset for scene text recognition.
11. **TextOCR**: A dataset containing high-quality images with text.
12. **HierText**: A dataset featuring hierarchical annotations of text in natural scenes.

After identifying these datasets, I will then refer to the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to ensure that the datasets can be easily located by others.

With this information gathered, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing or review.
