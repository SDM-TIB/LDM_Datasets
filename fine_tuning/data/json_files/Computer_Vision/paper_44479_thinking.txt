To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Mixup-CAM: Weakly-supervised Semantic Segmentation via Uncertainty Regularization" by Yu-Ting Chang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract and introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, which indicates that this dataset is likely important for their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (section 4) to confirm the datasets used. In section 4.1, the authors explicitly state that they conducted experiments on the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**. This section provides details about the dataset, including the number of categories and the number of training images used.

I will also check the **related work** and **conclusion** sections to see if any other datasets are mentioned or referenced. However, the primary focus appears to be on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citation for the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For the **PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset**, the citation is:
  > M. Everingham, L. Van Gool, C. K. I. Williams, J. Winn, and A. Zisserman. *The PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2010 (VOC2010) Results*. Available at: "http://www.pascal-network.org/challenges/VOC/voc2010/workshop/index.html".

Since the authors used the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset for their experiments, I will ensure to include this citation in my dataset extraction.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, ensuring that I include the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation in a structured format for further processing.
