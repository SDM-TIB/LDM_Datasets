To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Better Text-to-Image Generation Alignment via Attention Modulation" by Yihang Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions the use of a "training-free phase-wise mechanism" but does not explicitly mention any datasets. However, the introduction discusses advancements in generative AI techniques and references several models, which may imply the use of datasets for training or evaluation.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **section on datasets** or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In this paper, the authors mention using the **COCO2014 validation set** for evaluation purposes in section 4. This is a clear indication that a dataset is being utilized.

Now, I will gather details about the **COCO2014 dataset**. The paper does not provide a detailed description of the dataset, so I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citation. The citation for the COCO dataset is:

- **COCO Dataset**: 
  > Lin, T.Y., Maire, M., Belongie, S., Hays, J., Perona, P., Ramanan, D., Dollár, P., Zitnick, C.L. "Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context." In Computer Vision–ECCV 2014: 13th European Conference, Zurich, Switzerland, September 6-12, 2014, Proceedings, Part V 13. pp. 740–755. Springer (2014).

Since the paper primarily discusses the COCO dataset for evaluation, I will ensure to include this dataset in my final output.

After confirming the dataset and its citation, I will compile the information into a structured format that highlights the dataset's name, description, and citation, ready for further processing or review.
