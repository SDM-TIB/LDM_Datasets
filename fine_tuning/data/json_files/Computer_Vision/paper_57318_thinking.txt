To extract datasets from the research paper titled "The applicability of transperceptual and deep learning approaches to the study and mimicry of complex cartilaginous tissues" by Waghorne et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, materials and methods, and results sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors trained and tested a generative adversarial network (GAN) on two datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 2 (Materials and Methods)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. They mention two datasets:

1. **Downsampled Dataset**: This dataset consists of 478 pairs of audio and image files, where the images were downsampled to 64 × 64 pixels. This dataset is crucial for understanding how downsampling affects the performance of the GAN.

2. **Full Resolution Dataset**: This dataset contains 7648 pairs of audio and image files, where the images retain their full resolution of 256 × 256 pixels but are segmented into 64 × 64 squares. This dataset is important for analyzing the impact of maintaining higher resolution on the GAN's performance.

In the **results section**, the authors discuss the outcomes of their experiments using these datasets, confirming their significance in the study.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. However, since these datasets are not standard public datasets but rather specific to the authors' experiments, they may not have formal citations like publicly available datasets. Instead, I will note the details provided in the paper.

For the **Downsampled Dataset**, the details are:
- 478 pairs of audio and image files, images downsampled to 64 × 64 pixels.

For the **Full Resolution Dataset**, the details are:
- 7648 pairs of audio and image files, images segmented into 64 × 64 squares from full resolution images of 256 × 256 pixels.

Since these datasets are created and used within the context of the study, I will summarize them as follows:

- **Downsampled Dataset**: 478 pairs of audio and image files (images downsampled to 64 × 64 pixels).
- **Full Resolution Dataset**: 7648 pairs of audio and image files (images segmented into 64 × 64 squares from full resolution images of 256 × 256 pixels).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format that clearly outlines each dataset, ensuring to include the context and details as provided in the paper. This will be ready for further processing or review.
