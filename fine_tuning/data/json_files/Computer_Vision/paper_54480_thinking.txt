To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Safe Semi-supervised Graph Convolution Network" by Zhi Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental evaluation sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the performance of the proposed Safe-GCN model is evaluated on three well-known citation network datasets, which suggests that specific datasets will be detailed later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental evaluation)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention three citation network datasets:

1. **Cora Dataset**: This dataset consists of 2,708 scientific publications, each represented by a 1,433-dimensional word vector. The publications are divided into 7 classes.

2. **Citeseer Dataset**: Similar to Cora, this dataset includes 3,327 publications, described by a 3,703-dimensional word vector, and divided into 6 classes.

3. **Pubmed Dataset**: This dataset contains 19,717 scientific publications on diabetes, represented by a TF/IDF-weighted word vector in a dictionary of 500 unique words, and divided into 3 classes.

To confirm the details of these datasets, I will check the **References section** for full citations. The paper cites the datasets as follows:

- For the **Cora Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Citeseer Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

- For the **Pubmed Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Sen, P., Namata, G., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Galligher, B., & Eliassi-Rad, T. (2008). Collective classification in network data. *AI Magazine*, 29(3), 93-93.

Since the datasets are commonly referenced in the literature, I will ensure to use the original sources for the citations if available. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that I include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research.
