To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Unsupervised Representation Learning from Pre-trained Diffusion Probabilistic Models" by Zijian Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract may provide a brief overview of the datasets used, while the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets in relation to the research.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. I will look for any specific mentions of datasets, including their names, characteristics, and any relevant details about their usage in the experiments.

In this paper, I will pay particular attention to any sections that explicitly mention datasets, such as "Dataset" or "Experimental Setup." If the authors provide a table or a list of datasets, I will extract the names and descriptions from there.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets. I will ensure that I capture all necessary details, such as authors, title, publication venue, and year.

For example, if the paper mentions the **CelebA dataset**, I will look for its citation in the references, which might look something like this:
> Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., & Tang, X. (2015). CelebA: A Large-scale Celeb Faces Attributes Dataset. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 810-818.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference and potential downstream processing.
