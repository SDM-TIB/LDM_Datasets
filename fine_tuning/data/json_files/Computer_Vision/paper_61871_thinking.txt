To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improving Tuning-Free Real Image Editing with Proximal Guidance" by Ligong Han et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections for any references to datasets. The abstract discusses the use of diffusion-based methods for real image editing but does not explicitly mention any datasets. The introduction may provide more context or specific datasets used in the experiments.

Next, I will look into the **methodology** and **experiments** sections, as these typically contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used for evaluation. I will pay close attention to any subsections that might be dedicated to datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

Upon reviewing the **experiments section**, I find that the authors mention using several datasets for their evaluations. I will note down the names of these datasets and any relevant details provided, such as the number of images, types of tasks, or specific characteristics of the datasets.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

For example, if the authors mention using the "Coco Dataset" for image editing tasks, I will look for the citation in the references, which might read something like:
> Tsung-Yi Lin, Michael Maire, Serge Belongie, et al. *Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context*. In European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2014.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset information in a structured format for easy reference, ensuring that all details are accurate and complete for future use or analysis.
