To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Efficient Video Indexing for Monitoring Disease Activity and Progression in the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract" by Sharib Ali and Jens Rittscher, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the use of endoscopy videos and mentions the need for efficient video retrieval methods, which suggests that datasets related to endoscopic videos may be present.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction** to see if the authors reference any specific datasets or provide context about the data they used. The introduction discusses the challenges of indexing and retrieval in endoscopy but does not explicitly mention datasets.

Moving on to the **experiments section**, I will look for any details about the datasets used for training and testing their methods. The authors mention that they used **10 oesophageal endoscopy videos** for their study, which indicates that these videos are part of the dataset they utilized.

I will also check the **methodology section** to see if there are any specific details about the characteristics of the videos, such as the number of frames or the conditions under which they were recorded. The paper states that each video consists of more than 15,000 frames, which is crucial information for describing the dataset.

Now, I will look at the **references section** to find any citations related to the datasets. However, since the authors did not cite any external datasets but rather used their own collected videos, I will note that the dataset is original and not publicly available.

The dataset can be summarized as follows:

1. **Oesophageal Endoscopy Videos**: This dataset consists of 10 videos, each containing over 15,000 frames, collected from different patients undergoing endoscopy for Barrett's Oesophagus monitoring.

Since there are no external citations for this dataset, I will note that it is an original dataset created by the authors for the purpose of this study.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information into a structured format for clarity and future reference.
