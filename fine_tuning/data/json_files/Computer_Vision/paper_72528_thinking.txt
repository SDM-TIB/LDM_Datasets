To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Landmark Alternating Diffusion" by Sing-Yuan Yeh et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the paper's contributions and may mention specific datasets used for experiments or validation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 5) where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. In this paper, the authors mention using **polysomnogram data from forty subjects** for the automatic sleep stage annotation problem, which indicates that a dataset is involved.

I will also check the **results section** for any additional details about the datasets, such as how they were processed or any specific characteristics that might be relevant for understanding their use in the study.

After identifying the datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets used in the research.

In this paper, the authors refer to the **Taiwan Integrated Database for Intelligent Sleep (TIDIS)**, which is the primary dataset used for their experiments. I will look for the citation associated with this database in the references.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset details, including the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and consistency.

Finally, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ready for further processing or review.
