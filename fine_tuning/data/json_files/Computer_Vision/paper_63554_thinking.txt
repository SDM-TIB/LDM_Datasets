To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DiffHopp: A Graph Diffusion Model for Novel Drug Design via Scaffold Hopping" by Jos Torge et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methods, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions the introduction of DiffHopp, a model for scaffold hopping, but does not specify datasets. Therefore, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss scaffold hopping and the need for generative models in drug discovery but do not mention any datasets directly. I will continue to the **methods section**, where the authors describe their dataset.

In **section 3 (Methods)**, the authors state that they trained their model on **19,378 protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind**, filtered for QED â‰¥ 0.3. This is a clear identification of a dataset used in their research.

Next, I will check the **references section** to find the full citation for the PDBBind dataset. The relevant citation is:

- For **PDBBind**, the citation is:
  > Wang, J., Wang, J., and Liu, Z. *PDBBind: a comprehensive database for data mining of protein-ligand interactions*. Bioinformatics, 31(6): 1007-1009, 2015. doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu730.

Now that I have identified the dataset and its citation, I will summarize the findings:

1. **PDBBind Dataset**: This dataset consists of 19,378 protein-ligand complexes used for training the DiffHopp model. The dataset was filtered for QED scores of 0.3 or higher.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the full citation is included for the dataset.
