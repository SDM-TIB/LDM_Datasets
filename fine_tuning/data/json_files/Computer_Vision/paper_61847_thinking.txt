To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ARTIC3D: Learning Robust Articulated 3D Shapes from Noisy Web Image Collections" by Chun-Han Yao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract provides a brief overview of the methodology and mentions evaluations on multiple existing datasets, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **introduction section**, where the authors discuss the challenges of estimating 3D articulated shapes and the need for large-scale image datasets. They reference previous works that rely on such datasets, which may lead me to specific dataset names.

In the **experiments section**, the authors explicitly mention the datasets used for evaluation. They refer to the **Pascal-Part dataset** and the **LASSIE dataset**. The Pascal-Part dataset is noted for containing images of various animals along with their 2D keypoints, while the LASSIE dataset includes web images of different animal species with 2D keypoint annotations.

Additionally, the authors introduce an extended version of the LASSIE dataset called **E-LASSIE**, which includes noisy images with occlusions and truncation, specifically collected for evaluating model robustness.

Now, I will consult the **References section** to retrieve the full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **Pascal-Part dataset**, the citation is:
   > Mark Everingham, Luc Van Gool, Christopher KI Williams, John Winn, and Andrew Zisserman. *The PASCAL visual object classes (VOC) challenge*. In IJCV, 88(2):303â€“338, 2010.

2. For the **LASSIE dataset**, the citation is:
   > Chun-Han Yao, Wei-Chih Hung, Yuanzhen Li, Michael Rubinstein, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Varun Jampani. *LASSIE: Learning articulated shapes from sparse image ensemble via 3D part discovery*. arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.03434, 2022.

3. For the **E-LASSIE dataset**, since it is an extension of the LASSIE dataset, I will reference the same citation as LASSIE, but I will note that it includes additional noisy images.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that includes the dataset names, descriptions, and full citations, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented and properly cited.
