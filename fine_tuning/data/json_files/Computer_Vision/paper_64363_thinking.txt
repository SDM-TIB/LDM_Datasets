To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SC-MAD: Mixtures of Higher-Order Networks for Data Augmentation" by Madeline Navarro and Santiago Segarra, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned or described. The abstract discusses the need for large amounts of data for learning on complex systems, which suggests that datasets are involved.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of obtaining labeled samples for graph datasets and the importance of data augmentation. This indicates that they may have used specific datasets for their experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **methodology section**, particularly where they describe the SC-MAD method. Here, they mention using both synthetic and real-world datasets for simplicial complex classification. I will look for specific names of datasets used in their experiments.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide results for their method on two datasets: **Vietoris-Rips complexes** and the **MNIST dataset**. They describe how they used these datasets for evaluating the performance of their proposed method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find full citations for these datasets:

1. For the **MNIST dataset**, the citation is:
   > Y. LeCun and C. Cortes, “MNIST handwritten digit database,” 2010.

2. The **Vietoris-Rips complexes** are not attributed to a specific dataset in the references, as they are generated from i.i.d. points sampled from shapes in R² (a circle and a figure eight). Therefore, I will note that this dataset is synthetic and does not have a formal citation.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citation for the MNIST dataset and noting the synthetic nature of the Vietoris-Rips complexes. This will provide a clear and structured overview of the datasets used in the research.
