To extract datasets from the research paper titled "DualMix: Unleashing the Potential of Data Augmentation for Online Class-Incremental Learning" by Yunfeng Fan et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of their proposed methods on several benchmark datasets, which indicates that datasets are likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used in their experiments. Here, they mention three datasets:

1. **CIFAR-100**: This dataset is constructed by splitting the CIFAR-100 dataset into 20 tasks with no overlapping classes. Each task is assigned 5 classes, with a total of 3,000 images per class, divided into 2,500 training samples and 500 test samples.

2. **Mini-ImageNet**: The authors describe this dataset as containing 100 classes, which are split into 20 disjoint tasks. Each task includes 5 random classes, with each class consisting of 500 training images and 100 test images.

3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: This dataset is also split into 20 disjoint tasks, with each task containing 10 classes. Each class has 500 training images and 100 test images.

To ensure I have the correct citations for these datasets, I will check the **References section** of the paper. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Alex Krizhevsky. *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. Masterâ€™s thesis, University of Toronto, 2009.

- For **Mini-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Oriol Vinyals, Charles Blundell, Timothy Lillicrap, Daan Wierstra, et al. *Matching networks for one shot learning*. Advances in neural information processing systems, 29, 2016.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > Ya Le and Xuan Yang. *Tiny imagenet visual recognition challenge*. CS 231N, 7(7):3, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
