To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Invertible Image Rescaling" by Mingqing Xiao et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset mentioned.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention specific datasets used for evaluation. In this case, the authors do not explicitly mention any datasets in the abstract, so I will proceed to the introduction.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section** (Section 4) where the authors typically describe the datasets used for training and evaluation. In **Section 4.1**, the authors state that they employ the **DIV2K dataset** for training their model, which contains 800 high-quality 2K resolution images in the training set and 100 in the validation set. This is a clear indication of a dataset being used.

Additionally, the authors mention evaluating their model on four standard datasets: **Set5**, **Set14**, **BSD100**, and **Urban100**. I will note these datasets as well, as they are crucial for understanding the evaluation of the proposed method.

Now, I will gather the full citations for each of these datasets from the **References section** of the paper:

1. **DIV2K Dataset**:

4. **BSD100 Dataset**:
   > Martin, D., Fowlkes, C., Tal, D., Malik, J. (2001). A database of human segmented natural images and its application to evaluating segmentation algorithms and measuring ecological statistics. 

5. **Urban100 Dataset**:

After collecting the dataset names and their corresponding citations, I will summarize the findings in a structured manner, ensuring that each dataset is clearly identified along with its citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
