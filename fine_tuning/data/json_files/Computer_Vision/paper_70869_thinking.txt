To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Zero-Reference Low-Light Enhancement via Physical Quadruple Priors" by Wenjing Wang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and the introduction often discusses the context and significance of the datasets used. The experiments section typically details the datasets employed for validation and testing.

In the **introduction**, the authors mention the challenges of low-light enhancement and refer to various methods and datasets used in the field. I will look for specific names of datasets mentioned here.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**. Here, the authors describe their methodology and the datasets they used for evaluation. They specifically mention using datasets like **LOL (Low-Light) and MIT-Adobe FiveK** for benchmarking their model. I will note down these datasets and any details provided about them.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to access the datasets.

For the **LOL dataset**, the citation is:
> Chen Wei, Wenjing Wang, Wenhan Yang, and Jiaying Liu. *Deep Retinex Decomposition for Low-Light Enhancement*. In British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC), 2018.

For the **MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset**, the citation is:
> Vladimir Bychkovsky, Sylvain Paris, Eric Chan, and Fr√©do Durand. *Learning Photographic Global Tonal Adjustment with a Database of Input / Output Image Pairs*. In CVPR, 2011.

Additionally, the authors mention gathering low-light images from various sources, which they refer to as the "unpaired set." However, they do not provide specific dataset names for this collection, so I will note that as a general reference without a formal citation.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation. This will allow for a structured presentation of the datasets used in the research.
