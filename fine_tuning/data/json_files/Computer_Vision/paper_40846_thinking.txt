To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Prediction of rare feature combinations in population synthesis: Application of deep generative modelling" by Sergio Garrido et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and application sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the authors implemented their models on a **Danish travel survey**, which suggests that this dataset is crucial for their research.

Next, I will look for specific details about the dataset in **section 4.1 (Data)**. Here, the authors describe the **Danish National Travel Survey (TU)**, which contains 156,248 individuals from 2006 to 2018. They mention that the dataset includes socio-economic characteristics and trip-related variables, which are essential for their analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Danish National Travel Survey. The citation provided in the paper is:
> DTU, C. F. T. A. F. D. T. (2017). *Danish national travel survey, datasets*. Retrieved from http://www.modelcenter.transport.dtu.dk/transportvaneundersoegelsen/dokumentation

Now, I will summarize the dataset details:

1. **Danish National Travel Survey (TU)**: This dataset includes 156,248 individuals and various socio-economic and trip-related variables. It is used to validate the proposed generative models in the paper.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that I include the full citation for the Danish National Travel Survey as it is critical for proper attribution and reference.
