To extract datasets from the research paper titled "REMOT: A Region-to-Whole Framework for Realistic Human Motion Transfer" by Quanwei Yang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted extensive experiments on two public benchmarks, which indicates that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Implementation Details and Datasets)**, where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used for training and testing their model. Here, they mention:

1. **iPER Dataset**: This dataset includes 30 actors with a total of 206 videos, featuring simple actions like A-pose and random actions. The authors specify that 164 videos are used for training and 42 for testing.

2. **SoloDance Dataset**: This dataset consists of 179 solo dance videos collected online, featuring 143 subjects performing various dance styles. The authors note that 153 videos are used for training and 26 for testing.

To ensure accuracy, I will then check the **References section** of the paper to find the full citations for these datasets. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

- For the **iPER Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Wen Liu, Zhixin Piao, Jie Min, Wenhan Luo, Lin Ma, and Shenghua Gao. *Liquid Warping GAN: A Unified Framework for Human Motion Imitation, Appearance Transfer and Novel View Synthesis*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), pages 5903–5912, 2019.

- For the **SoloDance Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Dongxu Wei, Xiaowei Xu, Haibin Shen, and Kejie Huang. *C2F-FWN: Coarse-to-Fine Flow Warping Network for Spatial-Temporal Consistent Motion Transfer*. In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), pages 2852–2860, 2021.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will summarize the findings:

1. **iPER Dataset**: A dataset with 30 actors and 206 videos, used for training and testing in the paper.
   - Citation: Wen Liu et al. (2019).

2. **SoloDance Dataset**: A dataset with 179 solo dance videos, also used for training and testing.
   - Citation: Dongxu Wei et al. (2021).

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
