To extract datasets from the research paper titled "InstaGraM: Instance-level Graph Modeling for Vectorized HD Map Learning" by Juyeb Shin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors conducted "comprehensive experiments on public open dataset," which suggests that a specific dataset is used.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Dataset and Evaluation)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for training and evaluation. They state that they trained and evaluated their network on the **nuScenes dataset**, which consists of 1000 scenes captured from a vehicle equipped with various sensors, including cameras and LIDAR.

I will gather details about the nuScenes dataset, including its characteristics and the types of annotations it provides. The authors mention that the dataset includes fully annotated HD maps, which is crucial for their experiments.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citation for the nuScenes dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:
> Holger Caesar, Varun Bankiti, Alex H. Lang, Sourabh Vora, Venice Erin Liong, Qiang Xu, Anush Krishnan, Yu Pan, Giancarlo Baldan, and Oscar Beijbom. *nuscenes: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving*. In CVPR, 2020.

With this information, I can summarize the dataset as follows:

1. **nuScenes Dataset**: A multi-modal dataset for autonomous driving, consisting of 1000 scenes of 20 seconds each, captured from a vehicle equipped with cameras, LIDARs, IMU, and GPS. It includes fully annotated HD maps and various sensory data.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format, ensuring that the full citation is included for proper referencing. This process will ensure that I have accurately extracted and documented the dataset used in the research paper.
