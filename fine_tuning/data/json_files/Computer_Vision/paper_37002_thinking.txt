To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Text Classification Improved by Integrating Bidirectional LSTM with Two-dimensional Max Pooling" by Peng Zhou et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experimental setup sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the experiments conducted, which may include references to datasets.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experimental Setup)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this section, I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant statistics.

In **section 4.1 (Datasets)**, the authors list six datasets used for testing their models. I will extract the following datasets:

1. **MR (Movie Review Dataset)**: A dataset for sentiment analysis, specifically for detecting positive or negative reviews. The citation for this dataset is:
   > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *Seeing Stars: Exploiting Class Relationships for Sentiment Categorization with Respect to Rating Scales*. In Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 115–124, 2005.

2. **SST-1 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank)**: An extension of the MR dataset aimed at fine-grained sentiment classification. The citation is:
   > Richard Socher, Alex Perelygin, Jean Y Wu, Jason Chuang, Christopher D Manning, Andrew Y Ng, and Christopher Potts. *Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality over a Sentiment Treebank*. In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pages 1631–1642, 2013.

3. **SST-2**: A binary version of the SST dataset with neutral reviews removed. The citation is the same as for SST-1.

4. **Subj (Subjectivity Dataset)**: This dataset is used to classify sentences as subjective or objective. The citation is:
   > Bo Pang and Lillian Lee. *A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts*. In Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics, page 271, 2004.

5. **TREC (Question Classification Dataset)**: This dataset is used for classifying questions into different types. The citation is:
   > Xin Li and Dan Roth. *Learning Question Classifiers*. In Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pages 1–7, 2002.

6. **20Newsgroups**: A dataset containing messages from twenty different newsgroups, used for document classification. The citation is:
   > Ana Margarida de Jesus Cardoso Cachopo. *Improving Methods for Single-label Text Categorization*. Ph.D. thesis, Universidade Técnica de Lisboa, 2007.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure to note down their full citations as they are crucial for proper referencing.

Finally, I will compile the dataset information, including their names, descriptions, and citations, into a structured format for further processing or review.
