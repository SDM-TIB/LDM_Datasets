To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Objective-Reinforced Generative Adversarial Networks (ORGAN) for Sequence Generation Models" by Gabriel Guimaraes et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information accurately.

First, I will start by reading the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any datasets mentioned or implied. The abstract discusses the generation of molecules and musical melodies, which suggests that there may be specific datasets related to these tasks.

Next, I will look into the **implementation details** section, specifically **section 4.1**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention:

1. **ZINC Database**: This dataset consists of drug-like and non-drug-like molecules. The authors reference the original source of this dataset, which is crucial for citation purposes.

2. **Essen Associative Code (EsAC) Folk Dataset**: This dataset is used for music generation and is mentioned in the context of the music generation task.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset:

- For the **ZINC Database**, the citation is:
  > Irwin, J. J., & Shoichet, B. K. (2005). *ZINC: A free tool for docking and screening. Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, 45*(1), 177-182.

- For the **Essen Associative Code (EsAC) Folk Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Chen, Z., et al. (2017). *Learning to fuse music genres with generative adversarial dual learning*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.01456.

Now that I have the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use.

This step-by-step approach ensures that I accurately extract and cite the datasets used in the research paper, maintaining the integrity of the information presented.
