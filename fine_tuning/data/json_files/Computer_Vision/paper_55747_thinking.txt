To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Convolutional Learning on Multigraphs" by Landon Butler et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure that I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may mention specific datasets used for experiments or evaluations.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section IV), where the authors typically describe the datasets used in their studies. I will look for any explicit mentions of datasets, including their names, sizes, and characteristics. If the authors refer to specific datasets, I will take note of their descriptions and any relevant details provided.

In this paper, the authors discuss two applications: **optimal wireless resource allocation** and **hate speech localization**. I will check if they mention specific datasets for these applications. For instance, they might use datasets related to wireless communication or social media interactions.

Once I identify the datasets, I will consult the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial, as proper citation is necessary for academic integrity and to allow others to locate the datasets.

For example, if the authors mention a dataset like "Twitter data from the 2015 Danish parliamentary election," I will look for the corresponding reference in the bibliography to provide a complete citation.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize each dataset, including its name, description, and citation, ensuring that I adhere to the required format for clarity and consistency.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format that can be easily reviewed or processed further, ensuring that each dataset is accurately represented with its full citation.
