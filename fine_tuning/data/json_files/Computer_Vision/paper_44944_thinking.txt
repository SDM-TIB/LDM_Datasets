To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Transfer Graph Neural Networks for Pandemic Forecasting" by George Panagopoulos et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and dataset sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions the use of human mobility data to forecast the spread of COVID-19, which suggests that a dataset related to mobility is likely included.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Dataset)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used in their study. Here, they mention that they utilize a dataset released by Facebook as part of their Data For Good program, which contains measures of human mobility between administrative NUTS3 regions. This dataset is crucial for their analysis.

The paper specifies that the data is collected from mobile phones with the Facebook app installed and that it includes three recordings per day, aggregated to provide daily mobility figures. The authors also clarify that they focus on four European countries: Italy, Spain, France, and England.

Additionally, the authors mention that the number of COVID-19 cases in these regions was gathered from open data listed on a GitHub page. This indicates that there are at least two datasets involved: one for mobility data and another for COVID-19 case data.

Now, I will look for the **full citations** for these datasets in the **References section** of the paper. The relevant citations are:

1. For the **Facebook mobility dataset**, the citation is:
   > Maas, P.; Iyer, S.; Gros, A.; Park, W.; McGorman, L.; Nayak, C.; and Dow, P. A. (2019). *Facebook Disaster Maps: Aggregate Insights for Crisis Response & Recovery*. In ISCRAM.

2. For the **COVID-19 case data**, the citation is:
   > GitHub repository for COVID-19 data: *https://github.com/geopanag/pandemic_tgnn*.

With these citations, I can now summarize the datasets:

- **Facebook Mobility Dataset**: This dataset contains measures of human mobility between administrative NUTS3 regions, collected from mobile phones with the Facebook app. It provides insights into how population movement affects the spread of COVID-19.

- **COVID-19 Case Data**: This dataset includes the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the regions of Italy, Spain, France, and England, sourced from an open data repository on GitHub.

Finally, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
