To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Analysis of Synchrosqueezed Transforms and Application Perspectives" by Rayyan Abdalla, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and practical implementation sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses the application of the synchrosqueezing transform (SST) in various contexts, but I need to look for specific datasets.

In the **introduction**, the focus is on the theoretical aspects of SST and its applications, but it does not provide specific dataset names. I will then move to the **practical implementation section** where the author discusses the application of SST to EEG data for seizure prediction.

Within **section 3.2 (Application to Prediction of Epilepsy Seizures)**, the author describes the dataset used for training the deep learning model. The dataset consists of intracranial EEG recordings from patients and canine subjects, which is made available by the American Epilepsy Society. This is a crucial piece of information as it identifies the dataset used in the experiments.

Next, I will look for the **dataset description and preprocessing subsection** (3.2.2) to gather more details about the dataset. The author mentions that the dataset includes pre-ictal and inter-ictal data clips, with a total recording duration of 100 hours for each subject, and that the data is recorded using 16 electrodes at a sampling frequency of 400 Hz. This information is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the dataset. The relevant citation for the dataset is:

- For the dataset from the American Epilepsy Society:
  > American epilepsy society seizure prediction challenge.

Since this is a challenge dataset, it may not have a traditional citation format, but it is important to note it as the source of the dataset.

Finally, I will compile the information into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and citation. This will ensure that I have accurately documented the dataset used in the research paper.

After completing these steps, I will have a clear and concise entry for the dataset that can be used for further analysis or reference.
