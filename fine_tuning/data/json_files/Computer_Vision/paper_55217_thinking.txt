To extract datasets from the research paper titled "A Contrastive Pre-training Approach to Learn Discriminative Autoencoder for Dense Retrieval" by Ruqing Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses the effectiveness of dense retrieval models and hints at the use of various benchmarks, which suggests that datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 4.1 (Experimental Settings)**, where the authors mention the **pre-training corpus** and **downstream tasks**. They specifically state that they used the **English Wikipedia** as the pre-training corpus. This is a significant dataset for their experiments.

Additionally, the authors mention several **public dense retrieval benchmarks** used for evaluation:

1. **MS MARCO Passage Ranking (MARCO Dev Passage)**: This dataset is used for passage ranking tasks in dense retrieval.
2. **MS MARCO Document Ranking (MARCO Dev Document)**: This dataset is used for document ranking tasks.
3. **TREC 2019 Passage Ranking (TREC2019 Passage)**: Another benchmark for evaluating passage retrieval.
4. **TREC 2019 Document Ranking (TREC2019 Document)**: This dataset is used for document retrieval tasks.

In the **References section**, I will look for full citations for these datasets. The citations for the datasets mentioned are as follows:

- For **MS MARCO**, the citation is:
  > Daniel Fernando Campos, Tri Nguyen, Mir Rosenberg, Xia Song, Jianfeng Gao, Saurabh Tiwary, Rangan Majumder, Li Deng, and Bhaskar Mitra. *MS MARCO: A Human Generated MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset*. ArXiv abs/1611.09268, 2016.

- For **TREC 2019**, the citation is:
  > Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Emine Yilmaz, Daniel Fernando Campos, and Ellen M. Voorhees. *Overview of the TREC 2020 Deep Learning Track*. ArXiv abs/2102.07662, 2020.

Now, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets utilized in the research paper.
