To extract the datasets from the research paper titled "Rethinking Low-quality Optical Flow in Unsupervised Surgical Instrument Segmentation" by Peiran Wu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant details, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by examining the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on the **EndoVis2017 VOS dataset** and the **EndoVis2017 Challenge dataset**. This indicates that these datasets are central to their research.

Next, I will look into the **experiments section**, specifically **section 3.1 (Datasets and Evaluation Metrics)**, where the authors provide a detailed description of the datasets used. Here, they clarify that both datasets are derived from the **MICCAI EndoVis 2017 Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge**. They describe the datasets as follows:

1. **EndoVis 2017 VOS Dataset**: This dataset includes 8 sets of stereo camera footage, each containing 225 frames recorded during various pig surgery procedures. The frames are annotated to identify different parts of robotic surgical instruments.

2. **EndoVis 2017 Challenge Dataset**: Similar to the VOS dataset, this version adheres to the original competition guidelines and excludes the ‘other label’ category, focusing on specific instrument categories.

The authors also mention that they perform a 4-fold cross-validation on both datasets, which reinforces their importance in the evaluation of their method.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets. The paper does not provide explicit citations for the datasets themselves, but it references the original challenge and related works. Therefore, I will cite the relevant challenge paper as the authoritative source for both datasets:

- For the **EndoVis 2017 VOS and Challenge datasets**, the citation is:
  > Sestini, L., Rosa, B., De Momi, E., Ferrigno, G., Padoy, N. *Fun-sis: A fully unsupervised approach for surgical instrument segmentation*. Medical Image Analysis, 85, 102751, 2023.

With this information gathered, I will summarize the datasets and their citations clearly, ensuring that I include all necessary details for future reference or processing.
