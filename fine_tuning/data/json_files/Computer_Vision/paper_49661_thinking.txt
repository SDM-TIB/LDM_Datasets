To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Joint Learning Architecture for Multiple Object Tracking and Trajectory Forecasting" by Oluwafunmilola Kesa et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract and introduction** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract states that the authors evaluate their method on the **MOTChallenge benchmark**, which suggests that this is a dataset of interest.

Next, I will look for specific mentions of datasets in the **experiments section** (Section 7). Here, the authors list several datasets used for training and evaluation:

1. **ETH Dataset**: This dataset is used to train the detection branch and provides bounding box annotations.
2. **CityPersons Dataset**: Similar to the ETH dataset, this is also used for training the detection branch with bounding box annotations.
3. **PRW Dataset**: This dataset is utilized for training the detection, re-ID, and trajectory forecast branches, providing both bounding box and identity annotations.
4. **MOT17 Dataset**: This dataset is mentioned as part of the training data for the evaluation of the proposed method.
5. **CUHK-SYS Dataset**: Used for training the detection and re-ID branches, providing bounding box and identity annotations.
6. **CrowdHuman Dataset**: This dataset is used for pre-training the model.

I will then check the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For the **ETH Dataset**, the citation is:

After gathering all this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described along with its full citation. This will provide a comprehensive overview of the datasets used in the research paper.
