To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Sobolev Descent" by Youssef Mroueh, Tom Sercu, and Anant Raj, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will start by reading through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions that the authors validate their approach on "synthetic data, image coloring, and shape morphing," which suggests that there are datasets involved, but I need to find specific names.

Next, I will look for a dedicated **Datasets** section or any mention of datasets in the **experiments** section. In the experiments, the authors discuss using "CIFAR10 images labeled truck" for their Sobolev descent experiments. This indicates that CIFAR10 is one of the datasets used.

I will also check the **experiments** section for any other datasets mentioned. The authors describe using "1000 samples of a 1D Gaussian" for a toy problem, which is another dataset. Additionally, they mention using "4k samples" for the image color transfer task and "6k samples" for Sinkhorn methods, which are also relevant datasets.

Now, I will compile the information I have gathered about each dataset:

1. **CIFAR10 Dataset**: This dataset is used for the Sobolev descent experiments, specifically for generating images of the truck class.
   - Citation: 
     > Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. *CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets*. 2009.

2. **1D Gaussian Dataset**: This dataset consists of 1000 samples from a 1D Gaussian distribution used in a synthetic example.
   - Citation: 
     > No specific citation is provided in the paper for this synthetic dataset, but it is a common statistical distribution.

3. **Image Color Transfer Dataset**: The authors mention using "4k samples" for the image color transfer task.
   - Citation: 
     > No specific citation is provided for this dataset in the paper.

4. **Sinkhorn Dataset**: The authors refer to using "6k samples" for the Sinkhorn method.
   - Citation: 
     > No specific citation is provided for this dataset in the paper.

After identifying these datasets, I will ensure that I have the correct citations for those that require them. For the synthetic datasets, I will note that they are commonly used statistical distributions and may not have formal citations.

Finally, I will compile the dataset entries into a structured format for easy reference and further processing.
