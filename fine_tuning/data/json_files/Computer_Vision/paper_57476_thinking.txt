To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Fine-grained Image Editing by Pixel-wise Guidance Using Diffusion Models" by Naoki Matsunaga et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the text.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research, and it may contain references to datasets used for training or evaluation.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. In this paper, the authors mention using several datasets for their experiments, specifically in section 4.1 (Experimental Setting). Here, they state that they used **FFHQ-256**, **LSUN-cat**, and **LSUN-horse** datasets. 

I will then look for detailed descriptions of these datasets in the text. The authors provide some context about the datasets, such as their purpose and characteristics, which is essential for understanding how they were utilized in the research.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

1. **FFHQ-256**: This dataset is referenced in the context of training pixel classifiers and is known for high-quality images of human faces.
   - Citation: 
     > Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, and Timo Aila. *A style-based generator architecture for generative adversarial networks*. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 4396â€“4405, 2019.

2. **LSUN-cat**: This dataset is used for training and evaluating the image editing methods discussed in the paper.
   - Citation:
     > Fisher Yu, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ari Seff, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. ArXiv, abs/1506.03365, 2015.

3. **LSUN-horse**: Similar to LSUN-cat, this dataset is also utilized for the experiments in the paper.
   - Citation:
     > Fisher Yu, Yinda Zhang, Shuran Song, Ari Seff, and Jianxiong Xiao. *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. ArXiv, abs/1506.03365, 2015.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review. This includes ensuring that each dataset is clearly described along with its full citation, which is critical for academic integrity and reproducibility.
