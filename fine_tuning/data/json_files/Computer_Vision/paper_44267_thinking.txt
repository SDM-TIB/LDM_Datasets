To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Incorporating Reinforced Adversarial Learning in Autoregressive Image Generation" by Kenan E. Ak et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections. The abstract mentions experiments on "synthetic and real-world datasets," which indicates that there are datasets used for evaluation. I will look for specific names of these datasets.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section 5) closely, as it typically contains detailed information about the datasets used. In this section, the authors specifically mention two datasets:

1. **CelebA Dataset**: This dataset is referenced multiple times throughout the paper, particularly in the context of image generation tasks. It is known for containing a large number of celebrity images with various attributes annotated.

2. **LSUN-bedroom Dataset**: This dataset is also mentioned as a benchmark for evaluating the proposed method. It consists of images of bedrooms and is commonly used in image generation research.

After identifying these datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

The full citations I will extract are:

- For the **CelebA Dataset**:
  > Liu, Z., Luo, P., Wang, X., Tang, X. (2015). *Deep learning face attributes in the wild*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), December 2015.

- For the **LSUN-bedroom Dataset**:
  > Yu, F., Zhang, Y., Song, S., Seff, A., Xiao, J. (2015). *LSUN: Construction of a large-scale image dataset using deep learning with humans in the loop*. arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or processing. This will ensure that the datasets are accurately represented and properly cited in any subsequent work.
