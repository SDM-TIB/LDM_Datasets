To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Improved Order Analysis and Design of Exponential Integrator for Diffusion Models Sampling" by Qinsheng Zhang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (Section 4), as this is typically where authors describe the datasets used in their experiments. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Experimental Setup."

In the experiments section, I will look for specific mentions of datasets, including their names, descriptions, and any relevant details such as the number of samples, types of data, and any specific configurations used during the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to access the datasets.

For example, if the paper mentions using the **ImageNet dataset**, I would look for the citation in the references, which typically includes the authors, title, conference or journal name, and year of publication. 

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes:
1. The name of the dataset.
2. A brief description of the dataset.
3. The full citation for the dataset.

Finally, I will ensure that the information is organized clearly and accurately, ready for any further processing or presentation.

By following these steps, I will be able to extract and document the datasets used in the research paper effectively.
