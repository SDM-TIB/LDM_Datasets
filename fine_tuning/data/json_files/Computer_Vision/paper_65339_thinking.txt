To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Local Graph Clustering with Noisy Labels" by Artur Back de Luca et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper, ensuring to include full citations for each.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to locate any references to datasets. The abstract mentions that the authors conducted empirical experiments on **six attributed real-world graphs**, indicating that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they explicitly list the datasets:

1. **Amazon Photo**: This dataset is described as a co-purchasing graph where nodes represent products and edges indicate frequent co-purchases. The dataset consists of 7,487 photographic equipment products and 119,043 co-purchasing connections.

2. **Coauthor CS**: This dataset is a co-authorship graph based on the Microsoft Academic Graph, consisting of 18,333 computer science authors and 81,894 connections.

3. **Coauthor Physics**: Similar to Coauthor CS, this dataset focuses on physics researchers, containing 34,493 authors and 247,962 connections.

4. **Amazon Computers**: Another co-purchasing graph from Amazon, this dataset includes 13,752 computer equipment products and 245,861 connections.

5. **Cora**: A citation network of scientific publications in computer science, comprising 2,708 publications and 5,429 edges.

6. **Pubmed**: A citation network for medical publications, containing 19,717 nodes and 44,338 edges.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

- **Amazon Photo**: 
  > J. McAuley, C. Targett, Q. Shi, and A. Van Den Hengel. *Image-based recommendations on styles and substitutes*. In ACM International Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR), 2015.

- **Coauthor CS**: 
  > A. K. McCallum, K. Nigam, J. Rennie, and K. Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- **Coauthor Physics**: 
  > A. K. McCallum, K. Nigam, J. Rennie, and K. Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- **Amazon Computers**: 
  > J. McAuley, J. Leskovec. *Learning to Discover Social Circles in Ego Networks*. In ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2012.

- **Cora**: 
  > A. K. McCallum, K. Nigam, J. Rennie, and K. Seymore. *Automating the construction of internet portals with machine learning*. Information Retrieval, 3:127–163, 2000.

- **Pubmed**: 
  > P. Sen, G. Namata, M. Bilgic, L. Getoor, B. Galligher, and T. Eliassi-Rad. *Collective classification in network data*. AI magazine, 29(3):93–93, 2008.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further use or analysis.
