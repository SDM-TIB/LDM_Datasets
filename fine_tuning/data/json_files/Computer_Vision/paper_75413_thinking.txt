To extract datasets from the research paper titled "E2VIDiff: Perceptual Events-to-Video Reconstruction using Diffusion Priors" by Jinxiu Liang et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions "extensive experiments on benchmark datasets," which indicates that datasets are likely discussed in detail later in the paper.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments)**, where the authors typically describe the datasets used for evaluation. In this section, they explicitly mention three datasets:

1. **HQF Dataset**: This dataset comprises 14 sequences captured by the DAVIS240 camera. The authors reference the original paper for this dataset.
   
2. **IJRR Dataset**: This dataset includes 25 realistic sequences also captured with the DAVIS240 camera. The citation for this dataset is provided in the references section.

3. **MVSEC Dataset**: Recorded using a synchronized stereo event camera system, this dataset is mentioned as well, and its citation can also be found in the references.

I will then check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each of these datasets:

- For the **HQF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Stoffregen, T., Scheerlinck, C., Scaramuzza, D., Drummond, T., Barnes, N., Kleeman, L., & Mahony, R. (2020). Reducing the Sim-to-Real Gap for Event Cameras. In Proceedings of the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV).

- For the **IJRR Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Mueggler, E., Rebecq, H., Gallego, G., DelbrÃ¼ck, T., & Scaramuzza, D. (2017). The Event-Camera Dataset and Simulator: Event-Based Data for Pose Estimation, Visual Odometry, and SLAM. International Journal of Robotics Research, 36(2), 142-149.

- For the **MVSEC Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Zhu, A. Z., Thakur, D., Ozaslan, T., Pfrommer, B., Kumar, V., & Daniilidis, K. (2018). The Multi Vehicle Stereo Event Camera Dataset: An Event Camera Dataset for 3D Perception. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 3(3), 2032-2039.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation as required. This structured approach will help maintain clarity and ensure that all relevant details are captured for future reference or processing.
