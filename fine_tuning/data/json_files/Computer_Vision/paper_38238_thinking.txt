To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SDRL: Interpretable and Data-efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning Leveraging Symbolic Planning" by Daoming Lyu et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract** and **introduction** sections to identify any mentions of datasets. The abstract discusses the experimental results but does not specify any datasets. However, the introduction may provide insights into the datasets used for evaluation.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** closely, as this is where datasets are typically detailed. In this paper, the authors mention using the **Taxi domain** and **Montezuma’s Revenge** as benchmarks for their experiments. I will note these datasets as they are crucial for understanding the evaluation of the proposed framework.

I will then look for any specific details about these datasets in the **experiments section**. The authors describe the **Taxi domain** as a grid-based environment where a taxi must pick up and drop off passengers, and they provide details about the rewards associated with different actions. For **Montezuma’s Revenge**, they describe it as an Atari game requiring navigation and collection of treasures, emphasizing the complexity and the number of actions required.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **references section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

1. **Taxi Domain**:
   > Barto, A. and Mahadevan, S. (2003). Recent advances in hierarchical reinforcement learning. Discrete Event Systems Journal, 13:41–77.

2. **Montezuma’s Revenge**:
   > Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A. A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M. G., Graves, A., Riedmiller, M., Fidjeland, A. K., Ostrovski, G., et al. (2015). Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning. Nature, 518(7540):529–533.

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing. This will ensure that I have accurately captured the datasets used in the research and their corresponding references.
