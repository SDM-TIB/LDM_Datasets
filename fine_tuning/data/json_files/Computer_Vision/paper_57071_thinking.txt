To extract datasets from the research paper titled "SinFusion: Training Diffusion Models on a Single Image or Video" by Yaniv Nikankin et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to see if any datasets are explicitly referenced. The abstract discusses the capabilities of the SinFusion model but does not mention specific datasets. Therefore, I will proceed to the introduction.

In the **introduction**, the authors discuss the advancements in diffusion models and their applications but do not specify any datasets. I will continue to the **experiments section**, where datasets are typically detailed.

In **section 6 (Applications)**, the authors describe various tasks that SinFusion can perform, such as diverse video generation and video extrapolation. They mention that they demonstrate the applicability of SinFusion to a variety of single-video tasks, but they do not name specific datasets here either.

Next, I will check the **appendices** and **references** sections for any mentions of datasets. In the **appendix B.1**, the authors refer to two datasets used for comparisons: the dataset from SinGAN-GIF and the dataset from HP-VAE-GAN. They provide some details about these datasets, including the number of videos and their resolutions.

1. **SinGAN-GIF Dataset**: This dataset consists of 5 videos with 8 to 15 frames each, with a maximum spatial resolution of 168 × 298 pixels. The dataset is referenced in the context of comparing the performance of SinFusion.

2. **HP-VAE-GAN Dataset**: This dataset contains 10 videos, each with a spatial resolution of 144 × 256 pixels. Similar to the SinGAN-GIF dataset, it is used for performance comparison.

Now, I will look for the full citations of these datasets in the **References section**. The citations for the datasets are as follows:

- For the **SinGAN-GIF Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Arora, R., & Lee, Y. J. (2021). SinGAN-GIF: Learning a generative video model from a single GIF. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (pp. 1310–1319).

- For the **HP-VAE-GAN Dataset**, the citation is:
  > Gur, S., Benaim, S., & Wolf, L. (2020). Hierarchical patch VAE-GAN: Generating diverse videos from a single sample. arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.12226.

Having gathered this information, I will now compile the dataset entries with their respective citations for further processing.
