To extract datasets from the research paper titled "MaskCRT: Masked Conditional Residual Transformer for Learned Video Compression" by Yi-Hsin Chen et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will start by reviewing the **abstract** and **introduction** sections of the paper. The abstract mentions that the experimental results are confirmed on "commonly used datasets," which indicates that specific datasets will be discussed later in the paper. I will look for any explicit mentions of dataset names or descriptions.

Next, I will examine the **experiments section** (Section IV) closely, as this is typically where datasets used for evaluation are detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically mention datasets, such as "Datasets" or "Evaluation Datasets." 

Upon reviewing Section IV, I find that the authors mention using the **Vimeo90k dataset** for training, which consists of 91,701 7-frame sequences of size 448 × 256. This dataset is crucial for understanding the training context of their model.

Additionally, the authors refer to three datasets for evaluation: **UVG**, **HEVC Class B**, and **MCL-JCV**. I will note down the details provided for each of these datasets, including their characteristics and any specific configurations mentioned.

Now, I will check the **References section** to gather the full citations for each dataset mentioned. This is important for proper attribution and to provide readers with the necessary information to locate these datasets.

1. **Vimeo90k Dataset**:

3. **HEVC Class B**:
   - Citation:
     > F. Bossen et al. "Common test conditions and software reference configurations." *JCTVC-L1100*, vol. 12, no. 7, 2013.

4. **MCL-JCV Dataset**:
   - Citation:
     > H. Wang, W. Gan, S. Hu, J. Y. Lin, L. Jin, L. Song, P. Wang, I. Katsavounidis, A. Aaron, and C.-C. J. Kuo. "MCL-JCV: a jnd-based h. 264/avc video quality assessment dataset." In *IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)*, 2016, pp. 1509–1513.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation. This structured approach will help in accurately documenting the datasets used in the research paper.
