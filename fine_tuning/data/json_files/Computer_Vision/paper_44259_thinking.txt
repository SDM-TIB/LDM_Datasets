To extract datasets from the research paper titled "In search of the weirdest galaxies in the Universe" by Job Formsma, I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document the datasets mentioned throughout the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methods sections** to identify any datasets that are explicitly mentioned. The abstract provides a brief overview of the research and may contain references to specific datasets used for analysis.

Next, I will focus on the **Data section** (Section 2), which is likely to contain detailed descriptions of the datasets used in the study. Here, the author mentions using data from the **third data release of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey**. I will note the specifics of this dataset, including the number of spectra and the parameters associated with them.

In the **Appendix A**, I will look for any SQL queries or additional information that might provide insights into how the data was accessed or filtered. This could include specific criteria for selecting the spectra used in the analysis.

I will also check the **References section** to find full citations for the datasets mentioned. For instance, the GAMA survey is referenced multiple times, and I will ensure to capture the complete citation for it.

Once I have identified the datasets, I will compile the information, ensuring to include the following for each dataset:
1. **Name**: The name of the dataset (e.g., GAMA survey).
2. **Description**: A brief description of the dataset, including its purpose and the type of data it contains.
3. **Citation**: The full citation for the dataset, which is crucial for proper attribution.

For example, the GAMA survey can be cited as:
> Baldry I. K., et al., 2017, MNRAS, 474, 3875â€“3888.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will summarize the datasets in a clear and organized manner, ensuring that each entry includes the name, description, and citation. This structured approach will facilitate easy reference and ensure that all relevant datasets are documented accurately.
