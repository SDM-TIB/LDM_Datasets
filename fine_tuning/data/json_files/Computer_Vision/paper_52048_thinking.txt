To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Learning the Pedestrian-Vehicle Interaction for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction" by Chi Zhang and Christian Berger, I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, methodology, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. In the abstract, the authors mention using the **Waymo Open Dataset**, which indicates that this is a key dataset for their research.

Next, I will look for more details about the dataset in the **introduction** and **experiments sections**. In the introduction, the authors discuss the limitations of commonly used datasets like ETH and UCY, which do not include vehicle annotations, and emphasize the importance of the Waymo Open Dataset for their study.

In the **experiments section**, the authors provide a detailed description of the Waymo Open Dataset, including its structure and how it was used for training and evaluation. They mention that the dataset contains 374 training records and 76 test records, collected in urban traffic scenarios, and that it includes annotations for both pedestrians and vehicles.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the Waymo Open Dataset. The citation provided in the paper is:

> P. Sun, H. Kretzschmar, X. Dotiwalla, A. Chouard, V. Patnaik, P. Tsui, J. Guo, Y. Zhou, Y. Chai, B. Caine et al. "Scalability in perception for autonomous driving: Waymo open dataset." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2020, pp. 2446â€“2454.

Since the authors primarily focus on the Waymo Open Dataset, I will create an entry for this dataset.

After gathering all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format that includes the dataset name, description, and full citation, ensuring that all details are accurately represented for future reference or processing.
