To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Large Language Models are Good Prompt Learners for Low-Shot Image Classification" by Zhaoheng Zheng et al., I will follow a systematic approach to identify and document each dataset mentioned in the paper.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to gather initial insights about the datasets used. The abstract mentions that the authors evaluate their method on a spectrum of **11 datasets**, which indicates that multiple datasets are involved.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** (section 4.1) where the authors explicitly list the datasets used for evaluation. Here, they mention the following datasets:

1. **ImageNet**: A large-scale dataset for image classification, widely used in the computer vision community.
2. **Caltech101**: A dataset containing images of 101 object categories, often used for fine-grained classification tasks.
3. **OxfordPets**: A dataset for classifying images of pets, specifically cats and dogs.
4. **StanfordCars**: A dataset consisting of images of various car models, used for fine-grained classification.
5. **Flowers102**: A dataset containing images of 102 flower categories, used for fine-grained classification.
6. **Food101**: A dataset with images of 101 food categories, used for food classification tasks.
7. **FGVCAircraft**: A dataset for fine-grained classification of aircraft, containing images of various aircraft models.
8. **SUN397**: A dataset for scene recognition, containing images of various scene categories.
9. **UCF101**: A dataset for action recognition, containing videos of human actions.
10. **DTD**: A dataset for texture classification, containing images of various textures.
11. **EuroSAT**: A dataset for satellite image classification, containing images of land use and land cover.

After identifying these datasets, I will refer to the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset. The citations are as follows:

Now that I have identified the datasets and their citations, I will compile this information into a structured format for further processing or review.
