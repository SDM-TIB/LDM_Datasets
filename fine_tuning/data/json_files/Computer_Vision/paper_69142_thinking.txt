To extract datasets from the research paper titled "StopThePop: Sorted Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent Real-time Rendering" by Lukas Radl et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant datasets and their citations accurately.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and methodology sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract often provides a concise overview of the paper's contributions and may mention datasets used for evaluation or comparison.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section**, as this is typically where datasets are explicitly detailed. I will look for any subsections that specifically discuss datasets, such as "Datasets," "Data Collection," or "Experimental Setup." In this paper, I will pay attention to any references to datasets used for training or evaluation, as well as any specific characteristics or statistics about these datasets.

In the **evaluation section**, the authors may discuss the datasets in the context of their results, which can provide additional insights into how the datasets were utilized and their significance in the experiments.

After identifying the datasets, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for each dataset mentioned in the paper. This is crucial for proper attribution and to allow others to locate the datasets easily.

For this paper, I will look for the following datasets mentioned:

1. **Mip-NeRF 360**: This dataset is referenced multiple times in the paper, particularly in the context of evaluating the proposed method against existing techniques. I will ensure to note its full citation.

2. **Tanks & Temples**: Another dataset mentioned for evaluation purposes. I will find its full citation as well.

3. **Deep Blending**: This dataset is also referenced in the evaluation section, and I will extract its citation.

Once I have gathered all the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each entry includes the dataset name, a brief description, and the full citation formatted correctly.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries for output, ensuring that they are clear and ready for any further processing or review.
