To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Towards Measuring Domain Shift in Histopathological Stain Translation in an Unsupervised Manner" by Zeeshan Nisar et al., I will follow a systematic approach.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract discusses domain shift in digital histopathology and hints at the use of various stains, which suggests that datasets related to these stains might be present.

Next, I will focus on **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, specifically **subsection 4.1 (Data)**, where the authors describe the datasets used for their experiments. Here, they mention that tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients, and they detail the staining procedures and the number of glomeruli annotated for each stain. The stains mentioned include:

1. **PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff)**: 662 glomeruli for training, 588 for validation, and 1092 for testing.
2. **Jones H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin)**: 590 glomeruli for validation and 1043 for testing.
3. **Sirius Red**: 576 glomeruli for validation and 1049 for testing.
4. **CD34**: 595 glomeruli for validation and 1019 for testing.
5. **CD68**: 521 glomeruli for validation and 1046 for testing.

This section provides a clear overview of the datasets used in the experiments, including the number of samples for training, validation, and testing.

Next, I will check the **References section** to find the full citations for the datasets mentioned. The authors reference other works that may provide the necessary citations for the stains used. However, since the stains are common in histopathology, I will also look for authoritative sources that describe these stains in the context of digital pathology.

For the **PAS stain**, I will cite:
- "Periodic Acid-Schiff Staining" as a common method in histopathology, but I will need to find a specific citation if available.

For the **Jones H&E stain**, I will cite:
- "Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining" as a standard technique in histopathology, again looking for a specific citation.

For **Sirius Red**, **CD34**, and **CD68**, I will similarly look for authoritative references that describe these stains and their applications in histopathology.

After gathering the necessary information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring to include the full citations for each dataset as required.

Finally, I will prepare the dataset entries in a structured format for further processing or review.
