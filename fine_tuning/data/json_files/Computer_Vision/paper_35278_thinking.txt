To extract datasets from the research paper titled "ICADx: Interpretable computer aided diagnosis of breast masses" by Seong Tae Kim et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract indicates that the effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on a public mammogram database, which suggests that a dataset is involved.

Next, I will focus on **section 3 (Experiments and Results)**, where the authors explicitly mention the dataset used for their experiments. In this section, they state that they used the **DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography)** dataset. They provide details about the dataset, including the number of region of interests (ROIs) cropped for the study, which were either malignant or benign masses.

The paper specifies that a total of 1,088 ROIs were used, with 454 being malignant and 634 benign. This detailed description is crucial for understanding the dataset's composition.

Now, I will check the **References section** to find the full citation for the DDSM dataset. The citation provided in the references is:

- For **DDSM**, the citation is:
  > Heath, M., Bowyer, K., Kopans, D., Moore, R., and Kegelmeyer, W. P. "The digital database for screening mammography." In Proceedings of the 5th international workshop on digital mammography, pages 212â€“218, Medical Physics Publishing, 2000.

With this information, I have successfully identified the dataset used in the research and its full citation. 

Now, I will compile the dataset entry into a structured format for further processing, ensuring that the citation is included as required.
