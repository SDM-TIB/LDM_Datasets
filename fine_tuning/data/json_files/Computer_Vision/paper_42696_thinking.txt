To extract datasets from the research paper titled "On the benefits of defining vicinal distributions in latent space" by Puneet Mangla et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** of the paper. The abstract mentions empirical studies on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, indicating that these datasets are likely used in the experiments.

Next, I will focus on the **experiments section** where the authors explicitly describe the datasets used. In this section, they mention:

1. **CIFAR-10**: A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
2. **CIFAR-100**: Similar to CIFAR-10 but with 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. **Tiny-ImageNet**: A dataset with 200 classes, each containing 500 training images, 50 validation images, and 50 test images, with images of resolution 64x64.

I will also check the **evaluation criteria** section, which references the CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and Tiny-ImageNet-C datasets. These datasets contain images corrupted with various distortions, which are used to evaluate the robustness of the models.

Now, I will look at the **References section** to find the full citations for these datasets:

- For **CIFAR-10**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*. 

- For **CIFAR-100**, the citation is:
  > Krizhevsky, A. (2009). *Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images*.

- For **Tiny-ImageNet**, the citation is:
  > CS231N. (n.d.). *Tiny ImageNet Visual Recognition Challenge*. Retrieved from https://tiny-imagenet.herokuapp.com/.

After gathering this information, I will compile the dataset entries, ensuring that each dataset is accurately described and includes the full citation. This structured approach will help ensure that I do not miss any important details or datasets mentioned in the paper.
