To extract datasets from the research paper titled "Score-Based Diffusion Models for Bayesian Image Reconstruction" by Michael T. McCann et al., I will follow a systematic approach to ensure I capture all relevant information, including full citations for each dataset.

First, I will read through the **abstract, introduction, and experiments sections** to identify any datasets mentioned. The abstract provides a general overview, but the experiments section is likely to contain specific details about the datasets used.

In **section 4 (Experiments and Results)**, the authors describe their experiments and mention a specific dataset they created for testing their algorithms. They refer to this dataset as the **Gaussian blobs dataset**, which is generated using IID Gaussian images filtered with a square averaging filter. This dataset is crucial for their experiments, so I need to note its details.

Next, I will look for any references to existing datasets in the **References section**. However, it appears that the authors primarily focus on their synthetic dataset and do not cite any external datasets. Therefore, I will only need to provide the details for the **Gaussian blobs dataset**.

The description of the **Gaussian blobs dataset** includes:
- It consists of 64 Ã— 64 images generated from IID Gaussian distributions.
- The images are filtered with a square averaging filter and thresholded to create the final dataset.

Since this dataset is synthetic and created by the authors, I will note that the citation for this dataset is essentially the paper itself, as it does not have a separate published reference.

Now, I will compile the information into a structured format, ensuring that I include the full citation for the paper as the source of the dataset.

The full citation for the paper is:
> Michael T. McCann, Hyungjin Chung, Jong Chul Ye, and Marc L. Klasky. *Score-Based Diffusion Models for Bayesian Image Reconstruction*. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), 2023.

With this information gathered, I will prepare the dataset entry for the Gaussian blobs dataset, ensuring that it is clear and complete for any future use or processing.
